"I used to sing in a band. I also have sung a lot of karaoke. I have always been a singer. I am good at it. Once I got sober though, I just stopped. It's been almost 2 years since I have sang karaoke even. Partly because of Covid but mostly because I couldn't bring myself to go into a bar and sing sober. 
Well I finally went tonight. Me and my step dad went and drank Pepsi and I sang one song. I was terrified. Shaking before I even started. I mean almost a panic attack if I would have let my emotions take over. But I love to sing I was determined. I put up my song and had to wait for like 7 people to go before me. Every time he called the next singer my heart was beating so fast and I was short of breath. It was ridiculous. I mean, I have been singing my entire life. Why was a so damn scared. Finally they call my name and I get up there. My step dad said after the first two lines of the song he was a little worried. But after that, I fucking killed it. I killed it! I was amazing. I did it, and I did it fucking sober! I can still sing and I can still sing Rock and I can still get into it. Sober!! 
Afterwards I literally grabbed my purse and I walked out. I was shaking so bad I had to move. Everyone cheered and clapped and they wanted me to sing again but one was enough. I will probably go again soon with someone from the program that sings but damn. That first song sober. It was crazy. My nerves were insane and just one shot of vodka would have calmed me right down. But I don't need that anymore.  Because of AA I know that if something terrifies me, I can do it anyway. I got a HP that is more powerful than what  booze could ever give me. Thank you AA!",alcoholicsanonymous
I‚Äôve cut down on drinking and doubled my dose of Wellbutrin (maintaining the same amount of Lamictal) and tonight I‚Äôm feeling overheated and inexplicably terrified. My heart is pounding. I‚Äôm a bit twitchy. I am so afraid of the prospect of a seizure. Please grant me reassurance,alcoholicsanonymous
"In the meeting tonight this was the topic. It struck me because we fight so hard to hold on to the habits and lifestyles that completely demoralize are true authentic self . I was thinking back and wondering why so long did I hold on to the pain, was it pride or ego maybe it was the fact that I didn‚Äôt believe that life could get better. I had to do something and frankly even the bottle was getting old or should I say the same embarrassing messes I kept re-enacting hoping that one day my life would change. I person I once partied with was sober and suggested a meeting so I went. I walked into that room of 80+ alcoholics and was uncomfortable and not really taking it serious. I learned that day that I might have a slim chance of getting 1 month sober , it‚Äôs funny 1 month was my goal that was back in June 1 2018 3 + years later I was my home group and this was the topic . I did not know back then but I surrendered my old life for a brand new one and I don‚Äôt regret which team I have chosen. 

Best decision ever",alcoholicsanonymous

"Nothing too terrible but do you have those meetings you go to where people share for WAY too long? Of course the chairperson says to limit sharing to 2-3 minutes to give everyone a chance but the same rotation of people share for 5 minutes? There‚Äôs a larger meeting in my area that has generally good meetings but I honestly almost want to start timing people sometimes. They‚Äôre really good shares and I love the people who are sharing but jeez. How do you even address it as being an issue? I know not all meetings are gonna be great, that‚Äôs alright, but maybe there‚Äôs someone who needs to get something off their chest that isn‚Äôt even necessarily me.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi all :)
I (31F) am looking for a sponsor. I live in the UK.
I currently have 24 days sober.

I previously have had a sponsor who let me go unexpectedly yesterday, so I have a grasp on the 12 steps and how it works. I have a copy of the blue book. I have not began any steps yet. I have attended multiple zoom meetings and try to do this at least once a day.
I currently work full time as a nurse and also have a disability. It had previously been suggested that I was not taking my recovery seriously enough due to not being able to commit to daily phone calls at specific times, gratitude lists being shared before 10am everyday, not making calls to 2 people from the WhatsApp group every day, meditating every day etc .

I found the approach quite overwhelming and I physically or mentally could not reach my previous sponsor's expectations which upset me. She was very helpful and insightful.
I am a chilled and laid back person but I am still serious about remaining sober and it means so much to me. Perhaps an strategy/arrangement with less obligations/duties will be less stress inducing and more achievable due to my lifestyle and current circumstances. If such a pathway exists and is attainable I would be so happy. 
I understand the importance of a sponsor and im worried if I go this alone I may falter. 

I apologise if this isn't the right place to seek a sponsor - if that is the case then any point in the right direction would be very valuable to me. Face to face meetings would be a good place to find a sponsor but I cannot routinely attend these like I can with Zoom. People on Zoom do offer sponsorship but I mostly attend American meetings and I feel logistically due to time zones a sponsor from UK would mean I can commit more and less likely to let anyone down. 

Thanks for your time",alcoholicsanonymous
I have no program and am about to drink. Who can I call,alcoholicsanonymous
"Its hard for me to quit because its like a form of self harm to binge drink, and when I want to quit, its because I care about my health, but I don't have anyone in my life who cares about me. So I often don't see the point and have a hard time when I get an emotional trigger. I am no contact from my entire family who are devoutly religious and do not care that a family member sexually abused me, and are all narcissistic in that they did not care and did not protect me, they have all protected my abuser. I have struggled with systematic abuse and abusive living situations and poverty ever since I escaped my family of origin. My abuser also stalked me for four years using his police position till I finally threatened legal action if it did not stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I often feel like no one would care if i did, I am the only one who cares if I live or die, but I am also terrified of living and dying, I am scared I will always be alone. And I am scared because I can't do it on my own, I have tried to quit on my own, and just can't do it, I am not stronger than this addiction and I wish I was. I wish I never drank in the first place. 

What happens at these AA meetings? Has anyone ever made friends or found sponsers at the meetings? I know its not a groupies meet up, but I do feel I would be stronger being around people who understand me that I can talk to. I feel so alone and I have avoided AA meetings because I am scared to even admit I have a problem but I have a problem. My stomach hurts, and I feel sick. How can I get over this hang over? 

I drink because I am so afraid of people, its to numb my fears that everyone views me as a discardable object and wants to hurt me. I drink because I am afraid of people and my feelings. I feel like a coward, and I feel sick.  I relapsed last night.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I've been drinking since my teens, my father was an alcoholic, so I got to witness shitty behavior from him. 
I'm not using him as an excuse, but I know he was part of the problem. 
Nowadays I can't drink responsibly, if that's even a thing, recently I've been letting drinking get the best of me. Drinking has become my routine, every day after work, to the point of getting the shakes if I don't. 
My fianc√© drinks too. I've asked her to stop or not keep any alcohol at home, but she's fought me on the subject every time. 
I love her more than life itself, but I can't continue down this path. I can't be a source of stress to her anymore, I want to stop!! The last time I got so drunk and lost in my thoughts, while she was trying to gelp me up, I swung my arns trying to get up and hit her face!! Something I've never done nor would I ever think about!! Now she has this painful, visible reminder of my behavior. I apologized a thousand times and she assured me I didn't do it on purpose, but I still did hurt her and that's killing me right now.
I don't want to drink ever again, but how can I do it if there's alcohol in the house? 
I poured it all out this morning, at least I thought I did,  but she had kept a few cans in the bedroom and asked me to please not throw them away. I'm afraid to take it away from her, cause I don't want her going out of her way to find a drink, if she's going to drink, I'd rather she does it at home, safely. 
I don't know what else to say nor do, but I'm done drinking. I just need tips on how to navigate this trip I'm about to start. Thank you all in advance.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Holy crap. I fell face first onto the cement from my pink cloud. I'm in the darkest place I've ever been. I've been open about it with my therapist and psychiatrist. 

I missed 3 meetings in a row, and I was supposed to pick up my 5 month chip yesterday. But I wanted to just lay in bed and sleep. I miss my home group and I feel bad for making them worried. I did text someone to let them know I'm okay and will make it to the next meeting on Friday. 

I don't even know where I'm going with this. I just needed to vent. 

No cravings for alcohol, even throughout this bout of depression. All I can think of is how grateful I am that I'm sober and going through this. Who knows how sick I'd be if I had booze to numb me. 

My sponsor just moved so I need to find a new one and I'm so not ready for that.

"I started drinking heavily about 2 years ago  when I was 19, I used to drink 100% pure alcohol dealing with daily withdrawals. I‚Äôve noticed when l‚Äôm sober that life just seems so boring and I have no drive or motivation to do anything. How long does this last?",alcoholicsanonymous

Trust me, I thought about it for hours prior to that.....it was just on my bed ready to drink. Next month marks a year being sober. I can't tell you how proud I am to wake up sober and with no regrets. It was the hardest fight I had to fight, yet. But I survived.....

1. I have a drink problem
2. I am not allown

4. I defo never what to go back there or be that person again.

I hear alot people mention about the initial high, that wears off after a while and then the hard work begins. This is totally on my radar and I will manage it when it arrives (most likely via meetings and here).

But, if anyone is in any doubt about AA and wants to stop drinking please just go. The people are lovely, the support is amazing and just the fact of knowing your not the only one going though this makes it very special.",alcoholicsanonymous
"i‚Äôm 18 and i haven‚Äôt touched alcohol in almost 2 years. I drank for about 6 months when i was 16, and I immediately started abusing it. I drank every day, at school, at work, and i started harming myself. It became life threatening. 

But people don‚Äôt take me seriously because i was so young, and i only drank for such a short amount of time. I never went to rehab (even though i probably should have). Idk if i‚Äôm like ‚Äòallowed‚Äô to use the label ‚Äòalcoholic‚Äô. When i tell people i used to abuse alcohol, they make fun of me and just don‚Äôt take me seriously, so i‚Äôm not sure i take myself seriously? it makes me sad, but also makes me doubt my experience.

"FOCUSING AND LISTENING

There is a direct linkage among self-examination, meditation, and prayer.  Taken separately, these practices can bring much relief and benefit.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 98

If I do my self-examination first, then surely, I'll have enough humility to pray and meditate - because I'll see and feel my need for them.  Some wish to begin and end with prayer, leaving the self-examination and meditation to take place in between, whereas others start with meditation, listening for advice from God about their still hidden or unacknowledged defects.  Still others engage in written and verbal work on their defects, ending with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.  These three - self-examination, meditation and prayer - form a circle, without a beginning or an end.  No matter where, or how, I start, I eventually arrive at my destination: a better life.

‚ÄúWhen we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed crisis we could not postpone or evade, we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either God is everything or else He is nothing. God either is, or He isn‚Äôt‚Äù Alcoholics Anonymous pg 53.

The program of Alcoholics Anonymous is not about me, demonstrating to God what I can do. It‚Äôs about God demonstrating through me what He can do. My sponsee is locked up, decided to take his will back. A member of my home group was found dead on Sunday. He had an 8 year old daughter. 2 other members of I know passed away from the disease in October.

Whenever I see the worst of our disease, I love to read this passage found in Appendix II in the far back:

‚ÄúMost emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual concepts. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial. We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program. WILLINGNESS, HONESTY and OPEN MINDEDNESS are the essentials of recovery. But these are indispensable.‚Äù Alcoholics Anonymous pg. 568",alcoholicsanonymous

10, 11 and 12.  I'm stilling working on improving 11, but I have I reach out to my higher power multiple times a day. Always in the morning. I have commitments at my home group and a detox. I've also been taking some people through the steps. 

Now after awhile of this I got insurance and saw a D.O. M.D. I have no energy, passion, motivation and I'm always sore and tired.  So I saw her last week and did a bunch of tests.

"So I've been in recovery for a little over 4 months now and as the title suggests I have a few questions about recovery and its effects on sexual activity. For the record, I'm a 29 yr male. So the number one thing I've noticed is my extreme sensitivity during sexual activity as compared to during my active addiction. Again gonna try to be not over the top but still get my point across. During my addiction I would have plenty of stamina in terms of endurance until completion, almost to a point of sometimes not completing period. Now after a few months of recovery, it seems like my sexual activity has swung in the other direction. I now frequently last to a minute if that. While I still maintain an erection, this has been mildly vexing in its consistency and such extreme in the opposite pattern. So my questions are is this something others (not just males) have experienced? Do others have experience with this tappering off and normalizing? Any advice for dealing with this? Still with my partner of past 4 years so partner is consistent. As is porn usage although just to experiment I have lowered it, although it was a healthy level before.

Not drinking alcohol for this long is something I haven't done for half of my life and I'm very grateful for getting to learn who I am again and getting to improve my life.

Have started inching back onto social media after being off of it for a while as well and I know that people's eyebrows are perking up seeing me slink back around in places haha. I am going to ask my career group about this but I'm also asking here, how exactly do you handle revisiting your past so to speak as someone who doesn't drink anymore? They are people I have to make amends with, but just people I knew from an old job or used to hang out with. Many people have been texting and trying to get back in contact with me and I will be starting to reach out to those people soon I guess.

"KEEPING OPTIMISM AFLOAT

The other Steps can keep most of us sober and somehow functioning.  But Step Eleven can keep us growing...

- THE LANGUAGE OF THE HEART, p. 240

A sober alcoholic finds it much easier to be optimistic about life.  Optimism is the natural result of my finding myself gradually able to make the best, rather than the worst, of each situation.  As my physical sobriety continues, I come out of the fog, gain a clearer perspective and am better able to determine what courses of action to take.  As vital as physical sobriety is, I can achieve a greater potential for myself by developing an ever-increasing willingness to avail myself of the guidance and direction of a Higher Power.  My ability to do so comes from my learning - and practicing - the principles of the A.A. program.  The melding of my physical and spiritual sobriety produces the substance of a more positive life.

"üåütrigger warning. Abuse and recovery üåü

Knowing everything happens for a reason and I‚Äôm exactly where I need to be living on life‚Äôs terms really does take a lot of the overcomplication out of my life.
8 ish years ago I was in a women‚Äôs refuge, had been born into abuse and had thought my only worth was be treat like shit on the daily as it was all I new. Not one person in my life was a positive influence so how could I be a positive influence? It‚Äôs something learnt. The abuse spiralled when I hit my late teens and I ended up thinking it was normal to be treat like a prisoner. I fell into clear co dependent issues and Daily witnessings of my abuser torturing animals, having no way out. Not even a phone and being threatened to have petrol poured down my throat while my shoes were taken . Daily abuse was in the cycle and I knew they meant what they said with threats because their actions showed it. 
I never learnt how to understand myself or process emotions. I was a jittery mess and had no where to turn. Would be panicking all day every day and struggled with thoughts of suicide. The day I started rebuilding my life I called the police and was moved into a hotel with a bag of stuff. I didn‚Äôt have much, just some basic clothes. Ended up doing a course that taught me how to recognise certain triggers (through women‚Äôs aid) somehow I managed to have jobs through this , although sparse and I tried to just study as much as I could too. 
Unfortunately it was challenging and the guilt and shame of it all used to eat away and I really spiralled with alcohol- started young on this too. The alcohol became the main constant in my life and I felt I had some security in this. I never drank in the mornings or at work so that was my perfect excuse to fuel it. I didn‚Äôt want therapy because I didn‚Äôt want to have to relive it all again. Every time I tried to rebuild my life I didn‚Äôt understand how to communicate properly as I‚Äôd been used to a certain way of living and it was difficult. Every time I had people showing any emotion (anger/happy) I struggled understanding and I just kept spiralling. Soon enough I kept getting told regularly to think before I speak. I wanted to but didn‚Äôt know how and it was a constant pattern of self sabotage. 
In the end I spoke out after keeping it all in. Somehow it felt a bit better. I didn‚Äôt realise until I started getting therapy and recovery the importance of speaking out as it sets you free from the baggage of your past. Tbh I didn‚Äôt even think I‚Äôd ever be able to comfortably write this . But the thing is this post isn‚Äôt for attention or any one to feel bad by this. This is for the silent suffering addict that is pretending everything is ok. Get in recovery and the work the program. Happiness isn‚Äôt man made by alcohol etc and feeling genuinely happy is a thing. We all have a story to tell and being able to see the growth in my journey is just lessons I needed to learn . I am starting to recognise my own defects of character and being able to work on this is what sets me free. Anyone‚Äôs opinions on my life does not matter and I can‚Äôt change what people think of me. All I know is I‚Äôm exactly where I need to be right now and I‚Äôm not having to try and control my life anymore. 
As times going on all the positives are showing like light bulb moments and being able to understand myself more and more every day is a blessing and I wouldn‚Äôt of been able to do it without recovery. I surround my life with as many positives as I can and recovery and give you it all in abundance. I have people in my life I trust and they trust me, I have a stable job that I try to push myself to take all the rewards I can handle because I know it‚Äôs the complete opposite of my past. People don‚Äôt like me and that‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm not in this world to question why or beat myself up over it. I meditate, write gratitudes and try to constantly take in all the growth I can get now and try to learn to the best of my abilities 

I recently got diagnosed with progressive lung desease and I have still stayed sober and am appreciative for another life lesson in this. Life happens on life‚Äôs terms and we don‚Äôt have to run back to addiction to cope. There is a solution.
Anyone that‚Äôs suffering reach out. It can get better

Anyone that got through this thanks for reading and I hope this helps someone struggling with addiction.",alcoholicsanonymous
"So I‚Äôm 26, and I would say on the outside I have a lot going for me career wise. However, for so many years now I‚Äôve been drinking so much. Not just socially, but I‚Äôve definitely been that functional alcoholic. No one knows how bad it is besides my ex because he lived with me and saw me have weeks where I drank everyday. Alcohol has definitely affected our relationship and he has told me over and over how it changes me. I hear him, but I realized when I‚Äôm here in State A I drink. When I go back home to State B I don‚Äôt even think about alcohol. I don‚Äôt crave it, even in social settings I won‚Äôt take a sip. It was recently my birthday and in State B during a celebration dinner, I didn‚Äôt drink. Because of my control in State B, I know I haven‚Äôt reached the worst levels of alcoholism. However, I know it‚Äôs there. Last night I reached an all time low. I not only drank but I lose my self worth, and do things I‚Äôm not proud of. I go through all the emotions that comes with drunk guilt, but I keep putting myself in the same situation. I know many people would say, hey just move out of State A. Yeah, I probably should but I‚Äôm in a position that I can‚Äôt right now. I don‚Äôt know what it is about being in this state, but my worst self always comes out. I‚Äôve never been to AA, I‚Äôm scared because of judgment in my career. I care way too much about other‚Äôs opinions. Life is rough, sure. But I really don‚Äôt have room to complain. I can recognize my privileges and the blessings I have. I just don‚Äôt understand why after so many years, so many mistakes, I can‚Äôt find the will the change. Why can‚Äôt I control myself in this State. I have so much opportunity and I‚Äôm ruining everything. I want change, but even typing this now. I know I‚Äôll feel bad tonight and probably have another bottle of wine tomorrow night.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I was working with a sponsee recently and had this idea come up in our discussion. You may have experience enough to have heard or even tried to ""work a fourth step for it"" when a resentment comes up in recovery. My thought was, shouldn't we be able to do that with all of the steps?

Thinking about drinking? Work the 1st step.

Feeling hopeless? Work the 2nd step.

Expectations not being met? Work the 3rd step.

Etc.

Is that something people do? It seems like a really practical way to deal with common challenges to our sobriety. Maybe I'm trying to rewrite the 10th step here.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Two days ago I‚Äôve drank too much. From my estimations i was at about 0.28-0.38 percent. I stand at about 176cm am 56kgs on weight and 16 years old. I drank 1 shot of tequila, 4 shots of whiskey, 1 shot of tequila, 4 shots of vodka mixed with orange juice and two shots pure. After that I passed out and slept for about one hour or less. I can‚Äôt remember anything, but that‚Äôs what has been told to me by my friends, who waged my life: I started to throw up uncontrollably at around 9 pm and started to shake and cool out. I was unconscious and it went like this for two hours until 11 when we took an Uber home. At 12 I was laying in my bed and I woke up at 6 am (the first thing I remember after the blackout) and tried to drink water, which I immediately vomited out again. Then I went back to sleep and I did this about three more times, every time feeling a little better afterwards. At around 2 pm I got up and didn‚Äôt feel drunk anymore (at least not much) and my friends told me the story of the last night. I later went out for trick or treat with them, but took it lightly. Today, I feel like I have a clouded mind and as if I was on a plane (concerning my ears). I‚Äôve been to school and I‚Äôve been quite stable the hole day. I am not a chronic drinker and I only had this once before two months ago, but way lighter and with a quick recovery. I am so worried, that the alcohol poisoning might have caused irreversible damage to my brain or my body. Is there anyone whom I can talk to about this issue of mine? I am very scared and swore myself to stay away from alcohol for a long long time.",alcoholicsanonymous
"       I‚Äôm a 28 Year old male who is hooked on chewing tobacco. Since I was of legal age to use nicotine products. I‚Äôve quit cigarettes and dip and then come back to the habit countless times. I prefer chew because you can do it anywhere whereas with the other there are more restrictions. In May of this year I relocated from CO to N.J, acclimated myself to the A.A community here and got a sponsor. Overall  I feel like I‚Äôm having more success in my Recovery than I have in the last 6 years of being in and out of the rooms. I‚Äôve finally made it to Step Ten and I‚Äôve got 8 months of continuous sobriety. 
          However I‚Äôve noticed that my habit is taboo and that it makes people feel uncomfortable. I use a portable spittoon called a ‚ÄúMudjug‚Äù where you can‚Äôt see inside of it and it‚Äôs odorless. My goal is to meet and be closer to new people to make friends (and this is definitely happening) but it seems obvious to me that this habit interferes with my ability to connect with others. 
      The truth is I despise this addiction myself. I think it‚Äôs nasty too and I feel like crap after and sometimes during use as well as getting headaches and having to go to the restroom often because of it.  But I‚Äôm very much hooked on the ‚Äúnic fix‚Äù and feel like the flow of nicotine in my bloodstream keeps me wired and going. It is a strong stimulant for me and just like with drugs and alcohol, it satisfies an ‚Äúitch‚Äù that I have. I also worry about getting cancer at some point. The fear of going without any stimulant at all scares me, but I reason that if I got off the drugs then I can do this too. I‚Äôve set my quit date to December 1st. 
         Is there anyone out here who has dealt with a similar thing and managed to not just get off drugs and alcohol but also tobacco and nicotine? What is it like to live without a habit? How do you do it?",alcoholicsanonymous

"I'm 22 and the only time I've ever been to AA was when I was 20 and desperate (after breaking my hand and losing all my closest friends to alcohol related incidents).

"I considered my sponsor a friend and she kind of naturally became my sponsor after offering her help to me when I came in as a newcomer, taking me under her wing. But she started doing things I didn‚Äôt like, that made me uncomfortable, especially as an introvert and a desire to keep my personal life and AA separate- she kept showing up, at my house, she showed up at home the morning on my 6 months, unannounced, while I had family visiting who had flew in to see me- they found it weird. Another time she stopped by at night with her husband and son, around 9 pm (pretty much my bedtime) because she was in the neighborhood, startling me because I never have people stop by at the hour (or stop by uninvited at all), I told myself if it happened again I was going to let her go and then today (granted we had lost communication for a week being I had to replace my not-backed up phone after losing it along with my contacts and was waiting for her to text ME so I could explain this and also explain everything has been good, etc) she showed up at my job, expressing her worry and asking if I was okay, all in front of my coworkers and bosses, some who don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm even in the program. I told her it was an overstep of boundaries and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable working with her anymore.

"Two of the things that have held me (23F) back from quitting are:

1. Being not ready to give up alcohol forever.
2. Going on this ""sobriety journey"" while still living with my family where I have no privacy and I have to live these things out in the open.

So, on the day I finally decided not to drink anymore (Oct 3), at least for a while, I used the excuse of Sober October. That way, I wouldn't have to reconcile the thought of a life without alcohol, and I could pretend to my family that this is just a trendy, temporary change, not a whole new identity or whatever.

I'm proud of myself for having gone 4 weeks AF. I haven't been sober for that long since before I started drinking. 

I'm taking it day by day. I miss it, so badly, but it's been surprisingly manageable (don't get me wrong, I still smoke a ton of weed) and my family has been supportive without being suffocating.

So, I'm going to keep going. I don't know for how long. But that has made today really difficult as I feel I am starting this process of grieving the loss of my favorite pastime, most effective medicine, best buddy, etc. Also, next time I decline alcohol at home, they'll realize it's an ongoing (""permanent""?!) thing, and it'll be so Official. Of course, I know deep down that I don't want the accountability- if no one knows I quit, then when I inevitably relapse, everyone will know I failed instead of just me. Deep down I know I just already want to relapse in peace. So it's for the best that they know.

Maybe I'll just call this Sober November so I can keep putting off accepting this as something long-term. Anyone else in this extremely specific boat? Haha. Thanks for reading.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Change playmates and playgrounds AA suggested. The title is an example of the result of doing so.

A number of years ago I started experiencing symptoms of heart disease, chest pain walking my dog. started into pay-as you go medical treatment without insurance. Could see I was headed for some bankrupting expenses. 

Called on an AA friend, an accountant who had had some heart work done. He stopped whatever he was doing and got on the phone. Having good recovery, he thought nothing of putting my problem ahead of his work for the time being. For the same reason and having more clarity of thought than I, not being  threatened with the seemingly unsurmountable problem, he had some optimism and looked for facts to support it. His doctor suggested that I visit the medical education clinic of a particular good teaching hospital.  I did. I was accepted as a patient and treated like royalty as far as I was concerned. as it happened my resident had other business the day of my  angioplasty  with stent and one of the big guns with his name on the letterhead actually did the procedure. although I'm sure the intern would have done as good of job. I recovered completely and was back to work and life quickly. I paid $83,34/ month for a year for everything.

Years have passed and I started experiencing heart problems again. This time with Medicare and supplemental insurance I now pay for, I chose the same hospital, one for their excellent reputation and service and two to repay their generosity from years ago.

"I've known i was an alcoholic for a long time as whenever I'd have liquor or beer I'd somehow manage to finish it all and if by some miracle I didn't it'd be the first thing on my mind come morning. I tried countless times to quit and made countless promises to myself I knew I'd break, the withdrawals also would hit me hard including inability to piss, throwing up any water, lack of appetite but the worst of all was extreme boredom.

Friday I made the decision if I want to be where I see myself at 35 I need to put the bottle down today at the age of 23, a few years ago I stumbled upon 30k from the stock market and all that did was allow me to drink everyday worry free as my money dwindled away.

The longest I've spent without drinking in the last 4 years was probably a week max but this time I somehow just know my time with alcohol is done, im not sure if it will be forever but I know all it does is pull me back, I can no longer pull from my future to gratify my vices of today.

It took me upwards of 25 times id say waking up covered in vomit or having pissed myself but that didn't do the trick but somehow this time I just know its time, Goodluck everyone.",alcoholicsanonymous

"So recently I called my sponsor to give him my daily check-ins and he stopped me halfway through and said ‚ÄúLook, (my name), I haven‚Äôt been 100% honest with you. I don‚Äôt actually have two years sober. Tomorrow I will have one year.‚Äù He went on to say that when he was in sober living a year prior from the day of this phone call, he had gone out and used heroin and crack and was scrambling for fake pee to pass a UA. At the time, I told him he was still my sponsor and I thanked him for telling me. Once we got off the phone, though, I started questioning his credibility as a sponsor. He asked me to give him his one year chip that following day at a meeting. Now he‚Äôs going around and telling the people who have been affected by him living in this year-long lie. But I‚Äôm starting to notice he is getting short with me. He wants me to wake up at a certain time every day, do the daily reflection every day, and write down 5 things Im grateful for. I admit my fault, when i first wake up in the morning i wanna do stuff that is fun, not the meditation and 5 things i‚Äôm grateful for. and i also enjoy staying up late with my housemates and watching movies so getting up at the same time every morning is annoying. So yes, my fault i have been slipping with that. I‚Äôm 19 and i‚Äôm human. i make mistakes. Not excusable but reasonable. Anyways I admitted I lied to him yesterday about it and he got pissed. There was even a point where he called me just to yell and scream at me, and the second i tried to talk after letting him rant and chew me out, I just hear *beep beep beep*. I started wondering why he was so short with me yesterday and I remembered he is in the process of telling people he had not been living an honest program for a year. I also realized I have the self respect finally to draw the line where I‚Äôll tolerate how people treat me, and yelling at me over the phone and not letting me talk is something I don‚Äôt deserve. I get that a sponsor should tell their sponsee things they don‚Äôt want to hear but need to hear, and my sponsor has done that, but this was a whole new level.

"Hello everyone, my (37F) husband(39M) has a drinking problem.  He is sober on days that he works and is an amazingly sweet man but on his days off he decides he needs to make up for lost time drinking.  In the past he used to openly drink 2 bottles of wine, 3 large beers and half a fifth of vodka.  He would usually start at 9:00 am and be passed out dead drunk by 2:00 pm.  He would become horribly aggressive and obnoxious to the point I couldn‚Äôt wait for him to pass out so I could have a normal stress free day.  I told him he had to stop drinking when I became pregnant with our first daughter as I didn‚Äôt want a fall down drunk around our newborn baby.  He lied to me and never stopped.  I‚Äôve caught him twice now drinking vodka in secret and dumped it in front of him warning him I would leave if he did it again.  Well, he‚Äôs found a new hiding spot for his booze and will throughout the day take swigs of it but not get drunk to the point of passing out, just being aggressive and obnoxious.  Last night we were at his parents condo to celebrate Halloween and they could tell he was drunk right away.  I have high functioning ASD so I have a hard time identifying subtle changes so to me he was acting weird but I wasn‚Äôt thinking drunk.  We weren‚Äôt there 10 min before he starts a fight with his stepdad over not being able to get medical marijuana for free like a mooch from his stepdads supply.

Just curious if anyone else has experienced a lot more physical pain after getting sober?  I worked construction most my life (and drank almost daily) and since getting sober I have definitely noticed distinct pains in my body that were once what I would call more of a dull pain.  My knees have been aching almost throbbing at times. I'm not one to take Tylenol or Advil generally (mostly cause I was always drinking) but I've noticed I need to take pain killers if I'm doing physical work. I plan to speak with my doctor but it's something I was thinking about this weekend and I thought I'd put out there to see what others have experienced.  I figured cutting alcohol would reduce inflammation and pain especially joint pain but it appears to be the opposite for me,alcoholicsanonymous

As im writing this i had 
- 3x cans of 0.5 L of beer in the morning arround 8:30 am
- started workihg remotely at 9 o'clock was kinda sober ( well as sober as u can be with 1.5l of beer on an empty stomach chugged in less than 20 min)
- somewhere arround 1 pm felt a crazy urge and took a af an hour break and went in a bought a 6 pack
- for the majority of my day i was completely f**** useless, i was trying to code with my ide on one of my screens, amazon on the other and reddit porn on the other. Needless to say i was absolutely usless
- finished work 20 min ago and now im sitting at a local burger shop ordering a bottle of dark ale and a burger.

The only reason my ass isnt fired is that i wake up at 4 in the morning and actually get some work done till 8/9, before the cravings hit.
Im f*** puzzled how they heavent noticed that most of the time im drunk at work. Im literally yelled to my tech lead, argued with random people (very vigorously) in public slack channel's while being wasted af.

"Like the title says, I almost accidentally drank wine last night. My wife had white wine in a insulated cup with cap. She asked me to hold her drink while she tended to something else.

My mind was on auto-pilot, so with out thinking I brought the cup to my lips to take a drink. Luckily I noticed the acidic smell of wine and put the drink down and laughed. 

I am so grateful that after four years of sobriety, I was able to come that close and still walk away. The smell of wine sent a chill down my body, like I just smelled rubbing alcohol.

"Hi All,

I posted this in another sub reddit, while getting some advice and researching AA. I stumbled across this and thought I would post here as I have some questions.

I am 40 year old male; I have a really good job that is classed as one of the most stressful jobs in the world. I have a wife and family and friends. I never drank in the week, mainly because I cannot function the day after. But come Friday after work, I could easerly drink half a litre if vodka or 10 beers and get smashed! Of course, I thought, it was just my down time from work. I would then get in fights, do really really stupid stuff when out and be.....well......honestly..... a total bellend. I would then identity this is wrong, identity the drink as the problem. Go through a circle of guilt, anguish and embrassiment. I would stop drinking for a month and then start all over again. This weekend, the same thing has happened again. I am now 3 days from event in question, writing this, with my head in my hands in embarrassment. I cannot, I mean cannot continue with this cycle in my life as deep down, I am just a shy, big hearted nice guy. This funking ass that comes out when drunk......I hate, it is not me and I don't want to be this person any more. It is time to grow up and take some responsibility of my actions. Step 1  stop drinking for ever.

My question; 

1.does the above sound familiar to anyone? If so, how did you fix it?

2. What do you do with your spear time? I fear that if I don't occupie my self I will fail again.

3. AA; how can I make contact with a local group to get support?

4. What type of meetings are there? Is there a beginners one? 

Sorry if this comes across as a ramble, but my head is a mess right now, I I just looking for some advice.

"I have been thinking about alcohol and how it relates to other things to do and I would to start a discussion. I am going to share.

I think have gotten pleasure of enjoying perhaps an hour or two when I drank alcohol. It took that edge off. An escape from feeling like I was living a life clocking in to do things I hated. I connect with a person over a bottle that under everyday circumstances I couldn't connect with. I got to go to a place of singing, dancing and talking. Things I love. When I moved into my house. The feelings of being in love way surpassed that bottle feeling.

Alcohol nearly always caused a black out and stress the next day. When I had first started drinking I thought it was entertaining to wake up and a person would tell a story about all the funny things that happened. Years later, my mom started to tell one of those stories. And I looked at her and said my drinking must for somebody else to see because it were to know about then I wouldn't be blacking out? If I was supposed to experience what was happening I would of remembered it or been there.  That was a moment..an ephipany moment. Why would I do all that for an hour or two of a connection and then lose all that time to darkness and wake up feeling sick the next day. It didn't cause me to feel good anymore to hear stories that I did ever know even happened. And if they did, I was gone. So, why did it matter? 

How does it relate to now? When I talk with a person and think they are giving another made up story I feel sad cause I don't connect either it's a story and if it is not I wasn't there. 

What I wish is that we were both here. Enjoying each other.",alcoholicsanonymous
"It‚Äôs 5am where I am now and I‚Äôm suffering from insomnia effects plus hungover from a night of drinking. I have work in the morning and it‚Äôs not going to be lovely. So far I still have it together, like last week when I know I‚Äôll be busy with work I‚Äôd stop myself from drinking for a few days. I was craving for alcohol, but I was able to control myself. I‚Äôve not blacked out from drinking ever really, but I have driven home (10+ minute drive) under the influence that I passed straight out after I got home. I‚Äôve also intentionally starved myself because its easier to get drunk while hungry.

When I say I‚Äôm suffering from ‚Äòa night of drinking‚Äô it wasn‚Äôt very accurate. It‚Äôs been a three day trance, and I‚Äôve been drinking like this almost every weekend. I‚Äôve set rules for myself that I‚Äôll drink only on weekends, but lately I‚Äôm having strong desire to break that rule and drink like this every day. Hell, I thrive better on alcohol anyways, I‚Äôm more talkative, less socially awkward, happier, more motivated, braver, everything. But I‚Äôm scared. My partner‚Äôs extremely pissed off at me for drinking like this. I‚Äôve told them to please not take my alcohol away because they did it once and I‚Äôm horrified of how angry that made me feel. My home is a mess because I‚Äôve got no energy to clean things up. I‚Äôve dropped 10+ pounds in this past month just from starving myself so I can drink better. I don‚Äôt want to stop, I know I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt stop, parts of me thinks the fact that I can just not drink when I know I have things to do and I‚Äôve never blacked out makes me feel like I might not have a problem. Meanwhile other parts of my body, my life and my partner are all screaming otherwise. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should stop or keep drinking to see how this plays out. Any insights would be much appreciated‚Ä¶",alcoholicsanonymous
"So, I suffer from PTSD and I had fell into a state of alcoholism to cope. I was two months clean and then a couple nights ago I started drinking again, I drank a lot. And then last night I was with a group of friends, I drank a lot and said a load of thing I didn‚Äôt want to. I feel so guilty about it but that just makes me want to drink more. Its making me a monster and I dont know how to stop. I get therapy, I want to bring it up, but don‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I just want to drink more.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hey my name is Aaron and I'm an alcoholic. I'm over 2 years sober and I don't really know what to say here. I feel like I can't talk to anyone close to me, I feel like they'll just think im crazy and send me back to the hospital. My anxiety and what's happened to me while I was drunk keep me up at night. The constant paranoia and brokenness I feel makes it impossible to have a relationship. Not to mention the last time I trusted someone, they raped me......I feel like I can't get close to anyone, either cuz they'll betray me, or they just leave. I just really want...idk. Idk what would even help at this point.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I (24f) hold a good job, rent a nice townhouse, have some reduce cats etc. I lead a good life by most standards. 

Today I blacked out drinking for the first time.

That might not sound particularly bad, but for me, it‚Äôs traumatizing coming out of it. I was out for an hour or two. My roommates took care of me so I‚Äôm okay, but I‚Äôm terrified. I promised myself when I started drinking socially at 18 I‚Äôd never black out, that I‚Äôd always be aware of every stupid thing I ever did drunk. Today, I broke that promise. 

I‚Äôve spent the last two hours afraid to sleep because I know I‚Äôm still intoxicated and my mind keeps telling me I‚Äôll aspirate in my sleep, even though I‚Äôm only tipsy now. I know I need to not drink for a while at least, but I feel sickened that it‚Äôs come to this. I‚Äôm sorry for ranting, but I really don‚Äôt feel like I can talk to anyone else in my life without judgement. I‚Äôm just really upset by how everything unfolded this evening.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I CANNOT CHANGE THE WIND

It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels.  We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

My first sponsor told me there were two things to say about prayer and meditation: first, I had to start and second, I had to continue.  When I came to A.A. my spiritual life was bankrupt; if I considered God at all, He was to be called upon only when my self-will was incapable of a task or when overwhelming fears had eroded my ego.  Today I am grateful for a new life, one in which my prayers are those of thanksgiving.  My prayer time is more for listening than for talking.  I know today that if I cannot change the wind, I can adjust my sail.  I know the difference between superstition and spirituality.  I know there is a graceful way of being right, and many ways to be wrong.

"I‚Äôve decided to share my experience with my alcoholism and addiction, in hopes that someone struggling will be able to relate, or at least let the hopeless addict who may read this know that they are not alone. With that said, I‚Äôll begin by saying that I had turbulent childhood. My mother was incarcerated at an early age, and I was in and out of homes, dealt with a lot of trauma, as well as some decent stints of incarceration and homeless as a teenager. I started drinking at 12, smoking pot at 13, and was using needles by 14. Being a homeless at that age is very hard. I was sleeping under bridges, stealing food and trying to not get killed.The general formality of my childhood left a king size chipped on my shoulder. I was running the streets and eventually landed in a juvy center in which I had been in and out of several times before but this time I wasn‚Äôt getting out for about 16 months. It probably saved my life. When I got out I legitimately wanted to do good. My mother had been recently released from prison and I seriously cared about nothing more at the time than just being able to be with my mother. It quickly went to shit as she was an addict also, and just happen to be a phlebotomist. Before long she was helping me hit. I was a trash can at that point ,  was pushing mdma and heroin into my veins whenever I could, holding a shitty payed under the table job. She was back into prison pretty quickly. I spent 16-19 holding a job and working my way up , beating a heroin addiction but only to replace it with drinking and smoking pot excessively. At 19 I was raided by swat, suffering grave injuries from the raid. I was selling a lot of weed and mdma at the time, the only thing they didn‚Äôt take from me that day was my Coinbase account which luckily had enough funds for me to get a good defense and live off of for a little bit after I got out of jail. I was so gravely injured that I didn‚Äôt have to sit for very long, but it took me a year to learn how to walk again and by that time I had no body. At the time I honestly had just wished they killed me. I signed for ten probation, stayed out of trouble for a while and did everything I could to try and get my life back on track, But I was never willing to stop drinking and before I knew it I would cause anyone who would come to love me leave due to my excessive Xanax use and drinking. When I was 25 I had managed to hold a pretty high position with the company I worked for and my Roomate was just as bad as I was about drinking. I still as an adult was not willing to leave the street mentality behind and ended up back in jail here and there, but always could hire attorneys and just barely scrape by without getting really fucked . My life was in shambles, everyone I had used to see at party‚Äôs I only saw at funerals by then. I got a call  one of my last childhood friends had died one day after work. I was very close to her family and her, as they took me in when I was a homeless 13 year old living on the streets. I decided I should go check up on her mother and when I went over everyone was using heroin and me in my drunken state decided that was my sign. Never stopped using it, got fired , and was pretty hopeless. Decided I was going to start my own company, and got to it. But my addiction made me isolate literally as much as possible. Once I got a taste of some decent money, I graduated from heroin and Xanax to fentanyl and morphine analogs. This went on for about a year, many over doses , many trips to the hospital. I was ready to die. I won‚Äôt go into too great of detail, but I was constantly alone and doing everything in my power to kill myself. I couldn‚Äôt go without a couple of hours without poking myself, and ended up eating around ten Xanax bars a day. There‚Äôs literally many months and months of my life I do not remember. I don‚Äôt care too either.. I was using while I was out driving around and had one particular overdose in my truck in a parking lot that was within minutes of taking my life when I was narcaned. This was my life. I ended up getting a dwi in a parking lot while parked and back into fucking jail again. This time my lawyer took my money got me out and then told me he was gonna take my money and call it even for getting me out of jail, not represent me for my case unless I went to detox. Without the funds to hire a real defense I was not left with very many options. I so desperately wanted to get sober already, and figured I would just give it a try. Shot half a gram of dope ate a handful of Xanax asked my ex which I had lost in my addiction to please watch my dog, and was out to detox. Only problem was when you mix Xanax alcohol and heroin your liable to overdose, which I did. Woke up back in a hospital that my poor ex had taken me to because I fell out on the way to detox (I thought I was in detox  when i woke up there lol) and eventually by the grace of god a detox employee came and got me. Those 6 days were hell, as I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall are too familiar with. Had a seizure, the subs werent helping at all because of the analogs, and I slept about 8 hours total. 1 hour here maybe another hour there, never more than a hour at once. On the sixth day my lawyer called me and told me he wanted me into rehab or he I would be in prison. There was no way I was going to go, and when asked why he didn‚Äôt tell me this is the beginning his answer was ‚Äúbecause you wouldn‚Äôt have gone to detox had I told you‚Äù. He was right, and I‚Äôm so grateful for it. I didn‚Äôt want to work the program at all, the way I looked at it was like it‚Äôs just easy time. A couple weeks in when I started to feel okay I decided I better get my ass to work. I wanted to have some sort of fighting chance. I prayed and prayed. It wasn‚Äôt easy time at all. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired, I couldn‚Äôt help but to look back at all the fucking chaos in my life and it made me so sick. It still does. There was no fucking reason for things to be so damn hard. I had seriously always searched for answers, I wanted to know why my childhood was the way it was. Why my mother did what she did, why my father did what he did , why every fucking body did what they did. Never once did I look for those answers within myself. The old search only caused more paint and way more questions. I did not make anything easier on anyone. I needed to find myself. I completed rehab, got out and managed to salvage my business, get the woman I love back and fucking for once in my life experience it without any mind altering substances. I started a strong program with AA, and was fully ready to surrender. In the beginning I still kinda wanted to die, as I had made choices and decisions that I was never supposed to live long enough for to see the consequences. AA as given to me what I couldn‚Äôt possibly obtain myself. The program has made me a better man and sobriety is just a side effect. My mother never got that chance. I find myself now getting ready to start with a mentoring program to go back to the same facilities I was locked up in as a gun toting teenager to go and try to help kids now. Every fucking day I get to wake up sober. Every day I get the choice to either help someone else or sit in my own shit, and I refuse to do the latter any longer. I do believe life is a big gratitude test, I still have a lot of shit hanging over my head (prison is still a real possibility, Roomate mentioned earlier died last week   ) but for every 1000 things I have to bitch about I have at least one thing to be grateful for.  Like they say one day at a time. I didn‚Äôt write this trying to sound like a victim, I wrote this out in hopes that it may touch one person and to let you know that I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL!!! If I can do it you can do It. Pick up that book, find a higher power. Give yourself a chance. It‚Äôs worth fighting for.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hello all, my girlfriend has a serious drinking problem and it‚Äôs killing her, and it‚Äôs killing me to see happen. I‚Äôm done enabling her shit, we went to the hospital earlier today for some serious health issues and the only thing wrong with her was what the alcohol was doing to her. 

I‚Äôve been awake for two days keeping an eye on her literally constantly, she hasn‚Äôt left my sight for two days. And before we went to the hospital she had a glass of wine and half a beer. When they tested her, her BAC came back as 0.4 (no, not a typo). From a single glass of wine and half a beer. 

The only thing the doctors said was that it was killing her, and it‚Äôs the only thing that is wrong. But the second we got home she was drinking again, and obviously we got into a fight about it. 

I want to help her, I want to be there for her. I‚Äôve had my own struggle with alcoholism, I know this isn‚Äôt an easy thing to do. But she‚Äôs choosing the beer over me, and it‚Äôs hurtful. 

When I tell her that she gets inconsolable. She won‚Äôt be sober long enough to have a conversation about this, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. When I try to help give her the coping skills I used to have a healthy relationship with alcohol, she just has no interest in them and begs me to go buy her beer instead. And as ashamed as I am to admit it, I would. 

Any advice is appreciated, but mostly I just need to vent.",alcoholicsanonymous

"This is a long post but i wanted to be detailed in everything going on and my feelings:

I am 7 months sober, and take ADHD medicine that for me and my recovery and HP- i know my intentions in taking my meds are in no way for any other reason but for ADHD symptoms. I have never abused it and am very honest with ny self and ny HP when i take it to be sure I'm in right intentions for my sobriety. With that said honestly said..

So a while back when my SO (and the absolute love of my life and sober partner) and I first started dating he asked me about my sobriety and if I was taking substances at all. I have kind of learned from past experiences about telling people about me taking Adderall as prescribed and being judged in my recovery and didn‚Äôt want him to do that or doubt that I was honestly sober because he personally wouldn‚Äôt be able to take this medicine and consider himself sober- he was really insistent on how he needs to be with someone who is completely sober and can‚Äôt be with someone who isn‚Äôt or is taking things he doesn‚Äôt consider in sobriety.

When he asked me, I at the time wasn‚Äôt on it nor had been for a day or so, and didn‚Äôt have any left because I ran out and was still figuring out finding a new doctor 
 (I moved states).
So, in fear of him judging my sobriety, not wanting to be with me or have a relationship with me because of fear and trusting me, not understanding why I take it and how I don‚Äôt abuse it, just making his own conclusions and basing our relationship future off of a difference in opinions with my medicine and not allowing us to continue one or have trust because I take it- I didn‚Äôt bring up that I had still taken it in sobriety or that I was still planning on taking it eventually in the future.

I did it out of fear of losing him being misunderstood with my ADHD diagnosis and how i manage my symptoms, judgement of my recovery and sobriety and me personally. Plus, we had just started our relationship. So in my head it wasn‚Äôt that I wanted to lie or keep something from him, I just wasn‚Äôt ready to tell him about taking meds yet, I wanted to wait until we were more into our relationship and created more of a foundation of trust and love- I thought that then I would be able to have shown him how strong my recovery/sobriety is and how he can trust me entirely and trust my sobriety and we could talk about me being able to take my meds and understand how that doesn‚Äôt affect my recovery. 
I figured he‚Äôd be able to still love me and believe me later when I told him finally. I was so afraid he would get scared and leave or give up because I know he‚Äôs ultimately protecting his sobriety and his life above all else which is the most important. And I understand how being with someone who takes substances is a no no and very scary for him.

But I felt worse and worse about keeping this one thing from him, I finally  talked and was open to him about me taking it. 

He wasn‚Äôt happy, upset that I wasn‚Äôt completely honest and transparent from the get go, I explained why I was fearful and took responibility for where was wrong cuz I was- he says he understands. 
He loves me a lot and was hurt on that- and told me he can‚Äôt be with someone who takes controlled substances for his own sobriety. So I ultimately made him sad, wasn‚Äôt as understood as I hoped to be about my meds, and have to choose between being with him or taking my medication.

I told him I choose him, and I don‚Äôt want him to still have lost trust in me, or feel any future doubt or inability to be with me now that he knows I have taken it recently and used it at all- and I don‚Äôt want him to fear our relationship whether or not I take it was based on me lying. I don‚Äôt know if hell wholeheartedly be able to trust me, and I also don‚Äôt know if I can just stop taking this medicine and that is fair either.

 I don‚Äôt want to be on this medication forever, I need to find a doctor here and willing to find other solutions for meds, but I have them now and they help me, and I wish I hadn‚Äôt told him because everything I thought would happen kind of did, not to extremes at all, but I hurt him, he is worried a little and needs to think this over if we can get passed it, and ultimately he wouldn‚Äôt have known I was taking it- because it doesn‚Äôt change who I am and id taken it around him before I ran out- and none of this would have happened and I wouldn‚Äôt have hurt or worried him for no reason.

But I hated omiting truth to him, and if were a team I needed to be completely honest sooner than later and hope he‚Äôd understand, and I think he‚Äôs trying to on the why I kept it from him part- but now I don‚Äôt know how to make things better with him, im scared I messed things up, I don‚Äôt want to lie to him and take my medicine without telling him, I want us to get back to where we were in our feeling for one another and love and trust, and I am so scared we won‚Äôt be able to.

I don‚Äôt know how I should feel, im so sad I hurt him, im afraid to lose him, and I don‚Äôt know how to handle the medication situation and if I strait up need to choose him over taking helpful meds until I can change them- or if in this situation, its okay to maybe not involve him in my medication stuff. I don‚Äôt know if im completely in the wrong, and I don‚Äôt know what to do from here between us. 

I did a 10th step on this and am surrendering this over and know I'm powerless over his feelings and decisions about our relationship and future and my recovery  in his eyes. But I'm so afraid to lose him, omit truth, be judged, etc and don't know how to resolve this. 

Please any suggestions/support and experiences will help greatly!",alcoholicsanonymous

"I fell off the wagon last night. On a positive note, I didn't get drunk nor did I have a hang over. Usually I over do it and sleep on the floor in the rest room. I consider this a small victory. I didn't lose complete control, I didn't drink and drive, nor did I go back to get more. I've been trying for a while to stop, the most I was going was 5 days or less with out whiskey. I'm proud of those 21 days. Here are some things that I noticed about being sober.

- I saved a lot of money in October, around $500, maybe more. I smoke more cigarettes when I'm drunk, and then instead of cooking for my self a reasonable meal, I buy some fast food, which can be expensive, especially if I am drunk and getting it everyday. After a slew of drinks, I don't want to cook.

- I felt my brain was moving faster. My job felt easier, I could type faster. Other things as well, like I had more patience for problem solving.

- sober, I was a better person to be around. Family and friends told me as much, people that had no idea that I was 21 days sober, had mentioned that was just something about me that was different, in a good way.

- I had more time, to help my kids with their homework, accomplish little goals like yard work, cleaning out my garage, or other home improvement projects. Normally, being drunk, I wouldn't want to do anything. If I started drinking early enough, the day is pretty much over. I wouldn't accomplish anything. Getting stuff done made my house look great, which felt really good.

- I felt better, healthier then I have in a long time. My skin looks better too.

I'm not going to give up, if your reading this, you shouldn't either. We don't need alcohol to have fulfilling lives. I'm looking forward to all the things I will accomplish being sober. I can do this. You can too. Starting again today, I'm not going to drink.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Not drinking, praying at lest twice per day, going to meetings, reading A.A. literature, and talking to a fellow alcoholic everday is the bsis of what I was told to do. Since starting on my journey I've increased it to reading at least Pages 416-420 everyday. When faced with adversity, I call my sponsor and I read pages 416-420. When troubles arise with my significant other or someone else; I read pages 416-420. 

I strive to be of service wherever I can be; at home, with my family, picking up the phone to talk with other alcoholics and actively listening to them. I volunteer at my church and I strive to be as selfless as I can be. I still have my days of uncertainty but I find that things improve when I reach out to others who have experienced similar things that I have and have ""come out the other side"".

R: I understand that you're a human and we had a unique connection that was every sexualized and full of objectivism, perhaps that's why it was so physically gratifying, but I understand that our time may have been hurtful and I wanted you to know that I understand that. And that I feel you deserve acknowledgment as a human.

M: That's a description of your experience not an acknowledgment of mine.

R: I'm willing to listen.

M: You were there.

R: Let's just say I wasn't. What was your experience?

R: Anyway, I'm not prone to apologizes. I'm horribly flawed and frequently act selfishly. I just wanted to apologize for the way I treated you.

M: I'm genuinely sorry for you that you only know how to take from others. I'm sure that has caused and is causing you a lot of pain.

M: You have that line down pat. And I know you dish it out to everyone, not just me. That was a great day when I learned that.

R: I can accept that you wish not to accept my apology. I wish you well.

M: When you learn how to give a proper apology, I would be happy to field it. But what you said earlier shows that you have learned in eight years that I have a human body that you used to gratify yourself. eight years.

M: I was sitting here wondering what I got out of all of that pain. This. This is what you taught me. Don't take shit. But I'm still me so I'm still being far more generous than you deserve.

M: You're welcome.

R: I just wanted you to know that I failed to see you as a complex human and that I understand that caused pain.

M: I used to think you were turning down our insane potential. But what I realize is you weren't strong enough to be worthy of my heart.

R: I was in no place to be a teammate with anyone.

M: I appreciate your effort. I guess I still expect more decency than you are capable of.

M: That's a far cry from brutally using a good person.

M: Pointing out that you are an ass doesn't achieve anything, certainly not a pass.

M: But I thank you for showing that you acknowledge that I would be safe enough to even come offer an apology. That means more to me.

R: I see that you're deeply hurt and an apology will not be acceptable. I can't change the situation or relationship via texted words, that is very fair. I simply wanted you to know that I respect you and I wish I had treated you better.

M: Thank you. I appreciate that.

M: I made you cookies to deal with the pain. A kindness for you to counter the hurt you gave me. Did you get them?

R: Like recently... to Texas?

R: attachment: meme of little girl burning down a house with the caption: Next time don't eat my cookies

R: Sorry sorry sorry, I have a very twisted sense of humor given all the people that I watch die.

M: You're an ESFP aren't you?

R: I think ENTP

R: No ENFO

R: ENFP

R: Naw. I'm just a regular dude who's playing the song by ear. Sometimes I play beautiful notes, sometimes I play sour notes.

M: Honey. You REALLY gotta retire that shit and evolve.

M: Doesn't it get old using the same line a thousand different ways to every person for every reason?

M: Your roommates lucked out cuz I make the best cookies ever.

R: There aren't any other persons. It's just me and my boy.

M: I don't know what you're talking about. The fact you think I sent you cookies to a place I don't know where you live eight years later is.... you and your boy must be drunk. Rob, go get your kicks elsewhere. You still don't respect me.

R: My boy is my son, he'll Be 3 in December. I'm going back to Alaska to work in a clinic that an old work friend at UTSouthWestern who is now the chief therapist. She's going to have a baby and I'm going to cover her position. She's a dear friend and a bad ass therapist so I want to help. I had been thinking about you for some time and just wanted to reach out and apologize.

M: You know, that night at the cabin, you were in bed and I went out to the bathroom and all your friends were gathered together and they invited me into the group. But you thought I wasn't good enough for you because I wouldn't fit in with them. You speak highly of every other woman while you can barely muster an acknowledgement that you are thinking of physically gratifying yourself. Is your son born of a tattooed motorcycle-riding redhead that you've dedicated your whole soul to? I am beyond sad for you that you had such amazing opportunity to experience my love and you registered only my body. If you were an ENFP, you'd have an ocean more to you.

R: Fuck you. I was wrong to apologize. Own it.

M: Ha. We finally hit the truth.

M: Apparently you forgot what our connection was. You just reminded me the last time I felt it.

R: So happy only have one pain in the ass Baby Momma.

M: I don't even know what you're talking about. But you just showed your truth.

M: Baby Momma. Dude. You were supposed to be better than that.

M: Don't bring the same old person you were eight looooong years ago to my doorstep. I've lived and grown lifetimes.

R: Yup. I did. I give empathy and kindness and everyone wants money and more more more.

R: My mistake. I just wanted to apologize and say I didn't give you a fair shake.

M: This is actually my business now. I charge $100/hr for this.

R: Send me a bill.

M: Your name is written in the annals of my life story as the person who hurt me the most. Considering \_\_\_, that's quite the accomplishment. So you have no idea what it means to me if your apology was actually genuine and you actually did respect me. You're too afraid of me. Maybe in another 8 years. I wish you all the best in \_\_\_ I really do. And you know I am wholeheartedly sincere.

M: I'll take this. I'll take what you can give. Thank you.

R: Well if you've been \_\_\_ I hardly believe I did the most damage by taking you to the shooting range and buying you dinner and rocking your body, in a positive way, we had some really good times but things didn't lineup and whatever whatever whatever. But you're just getting nasty now.

R: Sorry I didn't see you as a long time partner, I should have let you know earlier.

R: I'm apologizing for not letting you know sooner.

M: You did let me know. And proceeded to use me. Willfully. Ruthlessly. As you have been thinking of lately. And that's why you're back wanting the same. Still not seeing me any different.

R: I apologize for monopolizing our sexual relationship because physically it was next.

M: ok drunkety drunk drunk. Thank you. I appreciate the apology. Go to bed.

R: I've been focusing on my sobriety for some time now, I reached out as part of the process. I understand the lesson now.

M: Well I don't. And you just invalidated your apology. So thank you for using me yet again.

M: Our connection wasn't physical. That's why you remain emotionally closed off to me, even in an apology attempt. It won't be valid until you can be brave enough to really access what it means. But good for the trying.

R: Lets just leave you and I in 2013. I accept my flaws and failures. I accept my role. I'm not that person anymore. I want you to know I did not treat you well. I can also accept you're not ready for an apology. I'm moving forward regardless.",alcoholicsanonymous

I finally decided to stop drinking last night. Today has actually not been so bad. Took a nap today and had a dream so realistic that it was amazing!

"I need help and everything is getting worse for me. I thought I had it under control but I‚Äôm keep ending up in the same loop every time. I don‚Äôt drink daily anymore but now I binge drink. The black outs, memory lose, and the random act of violence when I‚Äôm drunk is getting way out of hand. I just want it all to stop. Most times When I drink alone I‚Äôm totally fine, its when I‚Äôm drinking with people that‚Äôs the real problem. Drinking and with anxiety is not a good mix for me.  Also I‚Äôve became really emotional recently and when I drink i let them all out. I don‚Äôt know why but I just been feeling guilty for no reason. When I feel at my worst thats when I want to drink a lot. Drinking use to be fun and washed away all the pain and sorrow I felt but now it just rises it to the surface. When I drink with people it‚Äôs like  turn into another person. I‚Äôm the type of person who people come to when they need to talk and I admire that. Recently when I drink I turn into that person who needs a listening ear and don‚Äôt have any one to turn to. It started being irritating when I‚Äôm trying to vent and then the other person interrupts and go on about how they have it so much worst than I do. I use to not let it bother me but I recently just really needed to get somethings out and every time the same thing happens. I end up getting mad and looking like a drunk fool. I never use to be an angry drinker I wonder why I am like this all of a sudden? I was once told that there‚Äôs something deep down that I need to let out. I feel the same way when I don‚Äôt drink I‚Äôm just more In control of it. I know the simple fix is don‚Äôt drink at all but when I have these cravings it‚Äôs like I forget everything and it‚Äôs similar to me blacking out. I just really need someone to give me words of encouragement but also I need them to tell me the fuck off. This is becoming dangerous for me and others around me.

I got robbed the beginning of this year. Lost my car.. lost my dignity. I‚Äôm losing everything..


When I got sober earlier in the year, EVERYTHING was right... but I was still damaged. 

I lost my sobriety later this year and somehow feel like it just keeps getting worst. Even after being sober.

This cycle is toxic. And sure, I‚Äôll say I might need help but honestly I can stop right now and be alright. It‚Äôs been a week since I haven‚Äôt touched a drink..

"Before you chew my ass out about how i‚Äôm not willing enough, let me explain a piece of my story: 

I was working at chipotle, going off 5 days spun off ice. I had one of those notorious emotional breakdowns, due to the withdrawal and lack of sleep, all in the middle of my shift. I decided it was time to resurrect myself and made the decision for myself to march back into the life i left behind with my chest pointed to the sky and found a sense of purpose. I missed being close to my family and friends. So I told my family and they kicked me out: they told me I had two options: they‚Äôll pay for rehab *one more time* or to hit the streets. Lingering in that pink cloud I chose to go to rehab. Now I‚Äôve been out and I am living in sober living. I‚Äôm working the steps with a sponsor, doing daily readings in the mornings, going to meetings 3-5x a week, etc.

But I sometimes feel like I am not getting anything out of it other than days building up, and for what? To build something beautiful just to one day pass? Existential crises in recovery propel a sense of exaggerated somberness. Sometimes I feel like getting a tent and the substance of whatever my heart desires is no different from living the life of complete abstinence, just because life in it of itself is just the longest distraction from impending death that we‚Äôll ever do. 

does anyone have any friendly advice?",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi, 

TL;DR: After a ten year binge and a broken life, I'm sober again.

I'm new to this sub but not new to AA. I've been sober off and on for years and now I'm back. I'm back because I fucked my life up again, ended up homeless, and I'm staying at a clean and sober house to stay off of the streets. 

I ended up being homeless because my partner sold their house and decided to live in a different state. A place I didn't want to live. I went to the streets because I wasn't prepared to move out. Because I was drunk through the whole move. I ended up in a clean and sober house because something, call it God if you want, told me to unfuck my life. 

I can't remember when I started drinking again and I can't, exactly, remember how recently I stopped. Maybe last Friday. I'm thinking I might have started up again about ten years ago. I'm pretty certain it was everyday for ten years. For some reason I just can't remember all the details. 

In my first stretch of sobriety I made a principle to always be employed, never drink on the job, and keep a home. That didn't work out exactly as planned. Obviously the drinking became a problem.

I never thought I had a problem with alcohol. People drink, and work, and live their lives, and don't end up homeless. I never thought I was a ""real"" alcoholic. Those people are homeless because they love to drink more than work or live ""normal"" lives. I never thought I was one of ""them."" I fact, I still don't think I'm one of them. I know I'm wrong about that and the CD I'm experiencing is intense. I feel like I'm in shock. 

For the last six years I was in a relationship with a person who was my exact opposite in so many ways. Different religion, different politics, different views on financial matters, different views on how to live. But we were physically hot for each other and they liked to drink. But they were a ""normy."" We argued and fought a lot. And somewhere in the past three years I began to hate them. I also began to drink more and more. I knew why too. Because being nearly passed out drunk meant I didn't have to deal with how I felt about them. 

I'm a nice person. I would not say anything that would hurt a person deeply. I'd especially never say anything to a person about the mistakes they made in their past. This person had no problems with doing that. They consistently used my past against me. I could go on and on but I'll just say they were an emotional abuser. And they did it well. They hit all the traits: Manipulative, Controlling, Gaslighting, Demeaning, etc.. So along with the oppositional personality and their abuse I found good reasons to drink. I needed an escape. I even and often imagined killing myself because I couldn't find a way to escape them and ultimately escape my self. 

I've been sober for about a week. I've never craved alcohol. The cravings are strong. I don't know if I'm craving alcohol or just the escape from my feelings and troubles. Maybe the two are one and the same. I'm on my way to a meeting today. I've got some more problems to deal with but I'm just going to deal with today's problems, sober.

"Hello, new to this thread and AA in general. I've on and off attended meetings for a few years but never committed nor found a sponsor. I have a number of issues with AA that keep me away but the one that really got to me the most was the how it works that gets read at the beginning of each meeting. 

""Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average."" 

To me this always read as kind of culty or presumptuous from an organization that claims a 50-75% success rate and that the only alternative to AA was prison, hospitals and death. That being said I haven't actually talked to anyone in AA about this passage which I suppose is why I'm posting it here. What is your take on this section? I see it read so much but not really discussed.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Grateful and Humbled to still be sober after 11 months. I went to my first meeting last November and asked for a sponsor within 2 weeks. I‚Äôve worked the steps and have gone to meeting twice per week without fail. 

I share this because I tried to moderate on my own for a long time  and kept relapsing into getting drunk, usually within days or weeks. I battled with alcohol for 20 years.

The program works if you work it, the first step is the hardest. Admitting that you are powerless over alcohol and your life has become unmanageable. 

The gifts that I have received in the past 11 months are too numerous to count. I‚Äôve submitted to my higher power and try and live life on life‚Äôs terms. Allowing life to flow through me without my toxic, habitual resistance.

I wish all fellow alcoholics serenity and peace, our disease is real, but this program can and does help if you work it. ‚ù§Ô∏è",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi guys, I'll try to be brief.

I'm currently working in a country where alcohol is illegal. I've been here for a couple months and have at least 3 more to go. 

 I'm used to at least have 2-4 drinks per day once I'm out of work. The first 2 weeks here were hard. My body was asking me to go have a drink. And just being in a hotel room with nothing to do didn't help.  After those 2 initial weeks, I actually felt better and didn't miss drinking that much. I actually went back home for a week and even though booze was readily available I didn't even feel like drinking. Which was great!  
I'm now back in this dry country. It's been 2 weeks now and that alcoholism feeling is coming back again. It's driving me nuts and I have tons of anxiety.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Did it go away after a while? Looks like I'm pretty alcoholic if I'm feeling this bad. Any advice?

Note: No need to mention things such as going out (there's literally nothing but desert all around me), hanging out with friends (no friends and very little people here), doing sports (I do exercise every day for about 20 mins but forget about going out in the heat). I wish I could do any of those things but it's just not possible here.",alcoholicsanonymous

Never since it began has Alcoholics Anonymous been divided by a major controversial issue.  Nor has our Fellowship ever publicly taken sides on any question in an embattled world.  This, however, has been no earned virtue.  It could almost be said that we were born with it... 'So long as we don't argue these matters privately, it's a cinch we never shall publicly.'

Do I remember that I have a right to my opinion but that others don't have to share it?  That's the spirit of 'Live and Let Live.'  The Serenity Prayer reminds me, with God's help, to 'Accept the things I cannot change.'  Am I still trying to change others?  When it comes to 'Courage to change the things I can,' do I remember that my opinions are mine, and yours are yours?  Am I still afraid to be me? When it comes to 'Wisdom to know the difference,' do I remember that my opinions come from my experience?  If I have a know-it-all attitude, aren't I being deliberately controversial?

"Last week my sober living house got a new resident. I told them all week, ""this guy's getting high"". He came straight from treatment. The house managers kept testing him, and he kept passing. Last Saturday, they tested him again he came up positive for methadone. They decided to let him stay and send the test out to the lab because they thought maybe the gabapentin gave him a false positive. Later that night he snuck out after curfew. I called the house manager again he came at 1:30 a.m. and tested him still just positive for methadone. They decided to put him on a 10:00 curfew indefinitely and let him stay. Before he went to sleep he came up to me and said ""I know you have 11 months and take this very seriously and I don't want you to think I'm not trying to get better..""
I told him ""you don't need to worry about what I think, if you do the right thing this will all take care of itself."" I told him and all the guys in the living room ""if I think someone's getting high I'm going to say something because I don't want to find a dead body in this house"" that was the last thing anyone said to him before he went to bed. His roommate fell asleep on the couch in the living room and didn't go upstairs until 6:30 in the morning. Around 6:30 his roommate came into my room turn the light on and told me ""I think that dude is nodded out or overdosed‚Äù. I ran upstairs as soon as I entered the room I knew it was too late. There were purple spots all over his body he laid half on the bed with his knees on the ground and his face in the pillow. I administered narcan but I knew he was gone. I felt his leg, ice cold. I called 911 and had his roommates start waking everyone up in the house so they didn't get woken up by the police. His mother showed up with his sister and girlfriend and I heard them screaming and crying. They found a needle in his arm with half a shot still in it. Also, they found urine he was passing tests with.
When they put him in the body bag they didn't even carry him. They drug the vinyl bag across the hardwood floor. The sound haunts me. The whole thing changed me it's hard not to personalize. He died on his knees.. literally brought to his knees by addiction. I can't think of a more unflattering way to go. It's a reminder of why I'm here. Life gets good and I forget sometimes. Drug out like a bag of dog food. We deserve better. Finally, it makes me think of how selfish I have been. Seeing his family hurt. Our life isn't just ours. Everyone were encounter had a piece of it.

Although I found I was ignored whenever I tried to arrange said activities, and only called upon by her when she wanted to me as a drinking buddy. Of course my alcoholism would destroy me when I decide to cave in to seeing her, and damage our friendship even more so. I‚Äôd relapse and shame would consume me. 

Just recently I relapsed again with her, I decided to get honest, I let her know I was an alcoholic, and that most of our activities involved alcohol at the moment, that for me it isn‚Äôt healthy as I can‚Äôt control my intake, that it‚Äôs been a huge issue since my teen years, so for now I‚Äôd have to end our friendship until I was stable enough to meet her as to save our friendship, until we were both able to have that healthy space together we can enjoy our friendship in without it. 

Now I feel I may have made the wrong move by being honest, as though it was holier than thou, nobody needs to change anything I‚Äôm the one with an illness. Maybe I should have not said anything after the last awful relapse causing me to damage our friendship even more when Hyde came out again. Controlled myself when tempted.

Although I feel relieved to have said. I hope one day we can mend things although I understand friendships come and go at points.

How should we deal with close friends or friends in general in these situations? Is it normally best just to let things naturally dissipate, to ignore the elephant in the room, or to be honest about needing space and letting them know we‚Äôre alcoholics? How to communicate wanting space honestly without offending a culture I may not be able to join in with but don‚Äôt have anything against anyone participating in",alcoholicsanonymous

"It's a long story, but I technically starting drinking well before my breakup because of something I had did while I was still with my S/O (I think you can guess). Then the nightly drinking started, at first it would just be to get tipsy but then turned into getting really drunk every night to cope with the pain and also my anxiety and sleep problems :( only now am I realizing its a serious problem because it's been almost 3 months of this and I've decided its finally time to stop the nightly drinking and Ive been successful for a couple of nights now. But I'm worried my body has become addicted to it :( but I don't want to stop drinking on weekends with friends. Just a lot of trauma and stress and sadness.

"After three years and seven months of sobriety it looks like I'm not an alcoholic, my alcoholic mother told me that if she's not an alcoholic I'm not an alcoholic. Man what was I thinking, I better get out there and start drinking again it did so many great things for me! 

If I didn't have the sobriety, sponsor, and Alcoholics Anonymous this would be a great excuse to relapse!

I made an amends to her for being a bit brash when I told her that her drinking was worrisome for me due to a few strokes and her doctors recommendations needless to say she did not accept my apology and honestly that's on her. 

At this point my honest feeling is that if she never calls me and she goes to her deathbed without speaking to me she only has herself to blame and I will not speak to her again even though it hurts like hell!

"I‚Äôm only day 4 sober but this isn‚Äôt new to me. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúchronic relapser‚Äù. Have basically been on and off binging for 5 years now. Racked up 8 months once, otherwise it‚Äôs every 30-60 days like clockwork. I had 5 years sober before this. I have a tremendous amount of trauma and depression/anxiety issues on top of my poly substance abuse with alcohol being the number 1 issue. I need accountability and activities besides the gym (my only true outlet and current passion). 

Can I find a sponsor online or do I need to go in person? I‚Äôve tried meetings in person before but I‚Äôm so challenged socially with AA in particular,  no one at meetings talk to me and I‚Äôve never felt like I was a part of the group. I‚Äôve shown up as a newcomer multiple times and have never felt welcome, seems like everyone is already friends and don‚Äôt extend a hand, which is what I‚Äôm asking for right now. I have a hard time connecting but I need that if I‚Äôm to stay sober. Often a relapse is triggered by my lack of interpersonal relationships with people who understand, and well people in general as I‚Äôm quite a loner. So when I do vent to someone they just say things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an adult, go out and have fun‚Äù which I believe, and go out and drink myself into oblivion until I can‚Äôt anymore and I‚Äôm back at square one, shaky and gripped by the ‚Äúfear‚Äù brought on by withdrawal or ‚Äúhangxiety‚Äù.

1. Im an alcoholic, spirits have basically possessed or obsessed me since a drop of liquor first hit my lips. Drank daily 16-24 then got sober for 4.75 years; now I‚Äôm back at day 4 at 33 yrs old
2. There is nothing but a being greater than me that can guide my will to be aligned with a greater cause and thereby action 
3. I need to turn my will over to G-d as I understand it. I used to think drinking was turning my will over to god, I‚Äôm reality it was turning my will over to my shadow in a way that can‚Äôt be integrated 
4. I‚Äôm more than willing to make an inventory of myself and 
5. share it with another alcoholic in confidence, or a whole group for that matter 
6. - 11 I‚Äôve actually done all these steps when I was 24

Only thing is I fear becoming a groupthink member spouting idioms like ‚Äúone day at a time‚Äù without actually believing them to newcomers like me who found it a deterrent . I also don‚Äôt want the big book to be my Bible. It‚Äôs a normal book and a tool, nothing more.

Anyways I need a sponsor even though AA has always left a bad taste in my
mouth",alcoholicsanonymous

"I've been going to AA for a month now and it has saved my life. I've also been going to an intensive outpatient treatment program and it pretty much feels like a complete waste of time compared to AA, I don't think I'm going to finish it since it's voluntary. I've got so much more out of AA. I go to a decent amount of meetings and the readings are almost 100% always timely and exactly what I need to hear. Everybody in AA is soooo happy, and grateful, and go on and on about how amazing sober life is. I'm blessed to live in a community with a very active AA full of amazing dudes. I'm in a group chat with my sponsor tree with over 50 guys in it. I will be working the steps with my sponsor very soon and I'm really looking forward to that, I understand there will be some hard stuff in my brain to deal with but I'm ready for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just feel really good this morning and wanted to share. If you're struggling, find a meeting on the meetings app. Go to different meetings. Just listen to people at first. You will find the meetings you really like and fit in, and keep going. It really works. Have a great weekend everybody.",alcoholicsanonymous
"OUR SURVIVAL

Since recovery from alcoholism is life itself to us, it is imperative that we preserve in full strength our means of survival.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 177

The honesty expressed by the members of A.A. in meetings has the power to open my mind.  Nothing can block the flow of energy that honesty carries with it.  The only obstacle to this flow of energy is inebriation, but even then, no one will find a closed door if he or she has left and chooses to return.  Once he or she has received the gift of sobriety, each A.A. member is challenged on a daily basis to accept a program of honesty.  My Higher Power created me for a purpose in life.  I ask Him to accept my honest efforts to continue on my journey in the spiritual way of life.  I call on Him for strength to know and seek His will.

"Hi and Goodmorning.. 

I‚Äôve been awake since last night.. Haven‚Äôt slept due to overthinking and had no other place to go tonight but here, on this Reddit.. 

I don‚Äôt feel like the same person. I feel older, more experienced but at a cost.. the biggest loss was the future bride to be, who no longer speaks to me. 

I was in complete love, and never shared with my ex of my past alcoholism. And because of the frustration of my past, it collided with the future we were supposed to build with one another.

I plan on being a professor at a university, because it has been a lifelong dream of mine. But having her break up with me and abandon me at my most desperate time, my most vulnerable.. She left.

Ever since I lost her, I lost the will, the drive, that love.. It affected me so deeply that I missed a year of school, and since 2018 my sobriety has been hard to get in order. The love of my life moved to New York and really left me in the dust.. And my drinking just worsened..


I have a GF now but do not feel happy here with her, she makes me feel bad for being myself. I started drinking when our relationship began because honestly I am not happy here either..it‚Äôs not her fault I drink/drank, it‚Äôs just I drink to forget what a piece of shit I can be sometimes.

I miss my ex and it‚Äôs been years now. My body hurts from the alcohol abuse and im trying to be good.. 

I feel alone still, I just wanna find something with more meaning now..
I‚Äôm fighting the urge, but I need a reason to live without alcohol for comfort. I need help.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I'm 23, almost 24 (F). I realize over and over again that I've been using pretty much every day since I was 12/13. It freaks me out in a way it doesn't freak out my peers. My mom is a serious addict. She never went all the way to IV heroin while I've been alive (that I know of) but she was a junkie like 10 years before I was born. I feel like I have her tendencies. She's certainly been consumed by her addiction, she doesn't have relationships with her children, she hasn't had a long-term partner really since she and my dad broke up, she got evicted because of either just not paying or some drug-related offense I bet, and she was homeless when she was on heroin. She'll be 60 in a few months and is headed toward dying in squalor alone of her addictions and their consequences. I'm sad for her. I watched her get to this point and I understand how she just slowly crept there. I too use drugs just enough to keep afloat and not destroy everything all at once. I have jumped from addiction to addiction, some more destructive than others. I've stopped cold turkey on the bad ones at times but always held on to more ""manageable"" things.  

I've certainly damaged relationships and myself and almost died even. And that was enough to make me pull it back or stop for a time. But I've never been able to fully pull myself out. I've never truly committed. I've gone to therapy and rehab and found god and fallen in love and traveled and gone back to school. I've markedly made my life better and ""changed"" and gone after things that fulfill me and make me happy. I have long-term friendships. I worked on my relationship with my dad and distanced myself from my sister and mother who were abusive. I've gone to rehab a few times. I've honestly tried and moved forward. I subsisted for a few years on kratom daily and my life was good. I want, in theory, to be sober and healthy. I feel a lot of shame around all of this. I just moved to NYC a month ago and I've done coke two times by myself and multiple times with others and blacked out a few times. Both of which I haven't done in a while and def not consistently in years. Nothing terrible happened yet, I can feel it coming though, partying is so accessible here. Way more than where I was when I first started all of that. Why can't I break through? How bad of a bottom would I have to hit? I don't ever really let it go that far and even then, I can see how I'm just stealing potential and time and happiness from myself. At least I haven't yet, recently. But I know where it's headed and I can't let myself ruin everything I've built.  

Sorry this is so long, stimulants do that. 

TLDR: Please help me to help myself! How do I truly commit to sobriety and stop my addictions for good? How did you do it and why did you? I am young and don't want to waste my life. I have goals and interests!!",alcoholicsanonymous

I am almost 3 years sober and have limited experience with doing step 12. 

I have been helping one person in the rooms in the last few months, but am struggling quite a bit. 

She will get a few days up (great!!) and floats in and out of zoom meetings. I am impressed that she will come back to the rooms

But recently I have learned that she has been lying to me about how many days she has up, calls me drunk, and is abusing prescription medication. In one meeting we both attend at the end we say the Toronto Declaration ""I am responsible. When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand of A.A. always to be there. And for that: I am responsible.""

Recently I have found myself getting bitter over the Toronto Declaration, especially with her. I am struggling with repeating myself and going around in circles.

Last month I met someone off a dating app and I‚Äôm quite smitten. Things are moving fairly quickly and we‚Äôre both interested in a relationship, but I‚Äôve been firm with my boundaries regarding no relationships until I pass my year milestone, as well as certain boundaries surrounding drug and alcohol use. 

For those who mostly dated drunk and had to navigate dating and relationships in sobriety: how did it feel for you? Personally, I‚Äôm terrified most of the time because I can‚Äôt A) use alcohol as ‚Äúliquid courage‚Äù anymore, or b) get drunk to serve as a buffer against things that make me uncomfortable. I am experiencing all my fears and insecurities around close relationships with other people in real time, no checking out. As bad as I make it sound I‚Äôm also pleasantly surprised I could feel anything for someone as it is, when I used to drink it would make me feel more affectionate and amicable to others and I was worried those feelings would be inaccessible in sobriety.

How much it means to me that an unbroken tradition of more than half a century is a thread that connects me to Bill W. and Dr. Bob.  How much more grounded I feel to be in a Fellowship whose aims are constant and unflagging.  I am grateful that the energies of A.A. have never been scattered, but focused instead on our members and on individual sobriety.  My beliefs are what make me human; I am free to hold any opinion, but A.A.'s purpose - so clearly stated fifty years ago - is for me to keep sober.  That purpose has promoted round-the-clock meeting schedules, and the thousands of inter-group and central service offices, with their thousands of volunteers.  Like the sun focused through a magnifying glass, A.A.'s single vision has lit a fire of faith in sobriety in millions of hearts, including mine.

"My sobriety date is 6/14/2020. Prior to this, I had years of un-treated alcoholism in the form of not drinking and also not working the 12 steps. I went to meetings and talked the talk, but I looked for an easier softer method and after 7 years I contemplated suicide.

What I discovered is that I have a spiritual malady that requires a spiritual solution. I practice the 12 steps in all of my affairs, attend meetings, work with a sponsor and pray/meditate. But one of the most useful tools that I use daily is to seek and read literature as I have always had a fondness for the written word.

"I didn‚Äôt know how to phrase the question so I will try to clarify: my[26F] brother [21m] has been drinking since he was 16 but it has slowly gotten worse. We have a long history of alcoholism in our family and I have even felt like I like it way too much when I do drink. 

When he drinks he really becomes a different person, he gets aggressive (he punched a door down because I woke him up) or he just falls asleep for hours. Last year, his high school sweetheart broke up with him after he fell asleep for the millionth time and woke up at 8pm on a day when they were meant to go on vacation. At the time I thought she was unreasonable, but in the last year I have realized that whenever we hang out he brings a flask and passes out on my couch for hours.

I‚Äôve also witnessed some personality changes in her and when she gets angry I am frightened of and for her. Further complicating matters, she has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and has survived cancer before years ago. She also was a victim of child sexual abuse when she was a minor (she is now 37). Her family are dysfunctional too.
           After describing my relationship with her to a very close friend of mine in the program, he told me that I‚Äôm in an abusive relationship (emotionally and mentally) based on the things I told him and strongly recommended that it might be in my best interest to leave her. There are other reasons I want to leave too, but it feels difficult, though my heart tells me that this relationship is no good!

"I've been a social drinker since I was of age, and slowly but steadily have gotten more intertwined with alcohol in recent years.

It started becoming more of a thing when my grandmother died 5 years ago, and ramped up a bit more when I started living alone a couple of years later, and then again during Covid.

I know that I drink more that most (maybe all?) people I know, but up until lately I've dismissed this because I haven't really let it affect my work or social lives. A couple of weeks ago, while drunk, I looked up AA meetings near me for the first time ever. I came up with excuses to talk myself out of actually going at that time. 

I've been thinking about it again the last couple of days. I think my biggest hurdle right now is that I'm almost 100% sure that even if I go to a meeting I will mess it up and fall back into drinking fairly quickly, and I hate to fail...

I know that many don't succeed their first try at sobriety, but my brain is still having a problem with this thought.

"Not sure who else to talk to so here goes:

My wife and I are looking at having kids in the next 6 months or so, but I‚Äôm really concerned about her relationship with alcohol. I‚Äôve ‚Äúwalked in on‚Äù her in the kitchen a few times, just super drunk out of nowhere. Like, glassy eyes, swaying for balance, can‚Äôt get coherent words out drunk. Which in itself is annoying, but not a total deal breaker since there‚Äôs a lot about her that I love really deeply. But still, I find her unattractive when she‚Äôs in that state. 

What worries me is when I‚Äôll ask her about it, she‚Äôll say she didn‚Äôt drink anything. Also, I never actually see her drink, so I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs hiding it. Which isn‚Äôt a good sign. 

Still, the evidence is there. All the once-full bottles in the liquor cabinet are empty, and I haven‚Äôt been drinking anything over the last few months. Plus, there are some half empty fifths in the garage that I don‚Äôt remember getting. So clearly someone in the house is drinking, and it‚Äôs not me. Just the two of us live here. 

So I think she‚Äôs drinking in secret, and drinking a lot at times. Still, it‚Äôs not a daily occurrence. 

Where I worry is that she totally denies this, and denies the idea that she might have a problem drinking (I‚Äôve learned not to bring this up), and she is totally confident she won‚Äôt drink during pregnancy or with small children around. But I‚Äôve learned I can‚Äôt believe anything she says or promises about her drinking. So I don‚Äôt know what to do here. 

Basically, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll end up watching my wife hurt herself and our future child with her drinking, but at that point it will be too late to avoid this scenario. I don‚Äôt know how to discuss it with her. Since we‚Äôre both 30 I feel like there‚Äôs a little bit of a ticking clock here in terms of addressing her drinking and starting a family. But ultimately, I would rather have kids safely without her than with her if she doesn‚Äôt/won‚Äôt acknowledge this issue. 

She has a lot of trauma from her mom‚Äôs drinking when she was a kid (dad‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic too but hasn‚Äôt drank in 28 years). She HATES the idea of therapy and says, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how I process things.‚Äù But she gets weirdly emotional when talking about family stuff so I feel like she hasn‚Äôt so much ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù as ‚Äúrepressed‚Äù these issues. I think she has some self-worth/self-love issues around this, that aren‚Äôt getting better with age. 

As I understand it, direct confrontation isn‚Äôt the way to deal with alcoholism because the sense of shame just leads to more drinking. So really any advice on any of this would be good. Fuuuck, I‚Äôm stressed.",alcoholicsanonymous
"On Sunday, I had to go to a family party (cousin is joining the military and left Monday). I was at fifteen days sober on Sunday and feeling pretty anxious about all the alcohol that would be there and be pushed on me.

I get there and the food was already handed out so I lost my opportunity there. I got myself a plate and sat down and ate. The band is playing and my uncle starts throwing my second favorite tequila all over the dance floor and the people dancing and then pouring tequila into their mouth. The urge to drink was unbearable so I decide to help clean up. Im grabbing the dirty plates and my aunt asks me what im doing. I tell her I‚Äôm cleaning up, she tells me not to worry about it, I tell her I want to help. Well, my uncle hears and tells me I can help make drinks?!?!

"So being together with someone who has drinking problem is a roller coaster. 2 years of tending to them and little by little pulling them away from their life of running. Watching as they had trouble coming to terms with confronting their issues because the alcohol was always their solution instead of facing it head on. They grew so much and started finding stability. Fought me tooth and nail about going to meetings and after they got so far they always ended up sabotaging themselves. It was fight after fight over the Golden rule and their understanding of it was very self serving. It always came down to some from of slavery because issue came if I had any kind of freedom and if they did itlit was not supposed to be a problem. Contact fights of making it be know that if they didn't like the way I was return the treatment given to me then it wasn't okay in the first place and shouldn't have been done to me. Things would get better then fall apart in a repetitive cycle. Some fights were bad with shoves and yelling but this last one they got violent and then intentionally broke a window. Came back from a friend's birthday party to see they relapsed and were so depressed. Thought I would hate them but I didn't. I simply wanted them out of the car inside safe and sound so we could resolve this issue with a clear mind after rest.it didn't go that way and I had to throw them out. I can't get the feeling off of me that I hurt them even though I was hurt by them, but when they came back to get their belongings it was like talking to a lost child not sure why they did what they did and on the verge of begging for forgiveness. I don't feel I should give in because if I do again they will never understand that their actions have consequences because giving them a get out of jail for free card allows them to believe they can get away with it here and there..... I guess I just wish everything was different that that alcohol never caused them or anyone this sort of chaos and lack of control. If they had never had that problem I don't think things would have gone to these extremes but I do hope that they truly will grow from this and that instead of harming them that this will help them finally fight to save themselves.

"WARNING: This post contains harsh criticism of Abrahamic/Monotheistic Belief Systems.

Hello, I (23M) am an addict. I went to my first 12 step- program today and am very glad I did. It was an AA meeting at the university I am currently attending, and although I am not an alcoholic the leader of the program said it was okay if I attended the meetings. (I abuse marijuana and wax concentrate)

I am planning on reaching out to the leader of the meeting and asking him to help me with making a commitment to my sobriety. After the meeting he told me that the best thing I can do for sobriety is ask God to help me. The problem is that I do not necessarily believe in God. 

They told me that all religions can do AA and the 12 step program, even an atheist. The problem is I am not an atheist. I believe it is very possible God is real. I just have no interest in God or prayer... Even if I were to consciously admit that God is real I genuinely do not have anything to say to him. 

The way I see it putting my faith in God is pointless and naive. It doesn't matter if God is real because he isn't here now and he isn't going to protect me from anything. I know this because I have seen life at the bottom.. not personally but I have read and seen so many horrific things at this point that I refuse to believe God has a plan for us. There are so many people who don't really get to live out that narrative: people born with terrible malformations and diseases, little girls kidnapped and kept as sex slaves, Saudi warchild born to drug addicted homeless parents, etc.. Some people are born with zero hope or chance for anything but misery or suffering. The idea that nothing is hopeless and that there is some great plan is nothing but a complete lie. Humanity has conjured mythology to cope with and live in denial in face of the unbearable and awful reality actually is sometimes. Some people don't get chances, and there is no amount of prayer that will bring them salvation.

I think that the belief in God is one of humanities greatest mistakes. As long as we believe God will solve our problems then there is no motivation for us to become desperate to save ourselves from REAL tragedy horror, not some theoretical afterlife. 

That being said, my greater power is community. I am stupid, naive, hopeless, and ignorant- and so is mostly everybody else. However the community of my people is immeasurably greater in value and smarter than myself. When I am lost, arrogant, and useless, I can count on the community of my people that has upheld for thousands of generations and contains wisdom and elders I can seek guidance from. To me that is real, authentic, and effective. I do not think I will ever start praying until I am on my deathbed or in a foxhole, and even though I admit that would probably happen in such case I feel as if praying now would be lying to myself and I cannot honestly admit to the group or my mentor that I have sought out God because I rejected God already and have chosen a different higher power as the object of my 12 step program.

I guess I am just trying to figure out how I can get all of this across to a guy that thinks God is responsible for literally every event in the universe?... Without just telling him I think he is absurd and wrong?

TLDR;

I want to do the 12 step program but I refuse to integrate 'God' into my belief system. How do I stay honest about this without offending my AA leader and group without offending anyone or getting off topic?",alcoholicsanonymous

----------------------------------------------------- **now my question is:**
How do you break up with an alcoholic who doesn't want help and doesn't want to stop? How do you do it in a kind, loving and tolerant way? How do I explain my sobriety comes first? How do you say my goals and desires are different? 

A little background: 5 year relationship, we partied together he (34M) works and pays most of the rent but he drinks and doesn't want help. He has 3 DUIs. He is verbally abusive and it gets a lot worse when he drinks (it can get physical sometimes too). I'm (30f) no angel... like I'm an alcoholic too, but I've been participating in AA. I have a sponsor and I've been trying to change my life (currently on step 4).

Any advice welcomed. I just want to hear different perspectives while I try to figure out what God wants me to do.

Day 2: I am at the meeting location at the specific time. 15 minutes later, he still has not arrived. I text him to ask if he is still free to meet. He responds that he forgot and is not feeling well and that he will check in with me the next day.

Day 3: I call him in the afternoon. The phone rings and goes to voicemail. (I did not leave a voicemail or send a text and in hindsight, I should have.)

Day 4: I text him to ask if there is good time for us to check in. He responds that he will text me that afternoon. I did not receive any follow up text or call.

It is now day 5. I am annoyed and trying to not feel resentful. I am hesitant to text or call again, because I am afraid that I will say something I will regret. Last night, I felt angry but called some fellow AAs, meditated, and calmed down.

I like my sponsor a lot, and this is out of character. It is possible that there is more I don't know -- maybe there was a family emergency, or something else urgent. I just don't have information and would like to continue moving forward with step-work.

My pride is telling me that now it is on him to reach out to me; but I don't feel this is a healthy response.

Should I consider looking for a new sponsor? How should I approach asking him again if he is free? Admittedly, I would also be disappointed having to restart the steps with someone else.

"I ""quit"" 44 days ago, with the intention of quitting forever.

Now, I can't say I was an alcoholic, and my drinking habits were in the healthy range.

But my liver started hurting after a day of drinking (I don't exceed 3 drinks per day and each drink is 12 fl oz of beer, also, I have a 7-day in-between rule)  So I said that enough is enough. I'm going to stop forever starting with a 90 to really destroy the habit. 

But now doubts are creeping in my mind: ""Hey ... what if I drank right now, and completed the 90-day challenge with me cheating only once. After the 90 day challenge, I promise I'll drink just once a month.""

Maybe I haven't felt enough pain ... but I feel like it's not so bad if I only drink once a month.

Now, if you ever quit alcohol, don't ever come back. This isn't me trying to suggest anything. I had a pretty bad happening with alcohol a few years ago, but aside from that, I've just drunk with moderation.

This is just me asking your opinion on my approach. I know I have sufficient willpower to pull the 30-day rule, but I'm not sure. I was so happy at the thought that I will never drink again, but I don't think that thought is realistic for me.

Again, if you did quit, don't listen to a word I say.

"Everyone at AA is very gung ho about fellowship, always saying everyone should always come. When I was new, on my very second day of sobriety, a particular group at a particular meeting was going out to eat for fellowship afterward. I had raised my hand for a sponsor and a few remembered I had gotten my 24 hour chip at another meeting the day before, so lots of them stopped to talk to me afterwards and told me I should definitely go. It was very friendly and kind and I was willing to do anything in the beginning so I went.

Being there was a different story. A few talked to me for a moment at the beginning, but that conversation quickly fizzled out and everyone naturally segregated into their own smaller groups of their pre-existing friends. I tried chiming in a few more times but struggled to actually get into a conversation of any length. This one bit** right next to me said ONE WORD every time I talked to her until I gave up. Hate her til this day. They all just talked about people/ things that they knew and I didn‚Äôt. I tried my best to stay open and calm (as opposed to socially anxious) and I did not take out my phone. Overall, I did not like this experience. 

I don‚Äôt claim to be some amazing conversationalist, so I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs even all their fault. But I felt stupid for agreeing to go to fellowship when no one really wanted to talk to me, even when I was a raw 48 hours sober. And forget about now that I‚Äôm 2 months and not new anymore. I WOULD absolutely go to fellowship with my home group, or if a friend I knew was already there. But the whole ‚Äúdefinitely go!!!‚Äù thing is bullshit.

"I am 28(f). And I guess I don‚Äôt know where to start so a Reddit post seems ok. 

I grew up with an alcoholic Mum. My Dad left us, (brother now 30), when we were very small. The truth is I don‚Äôt know when this happened, my childhood is a blur, maybe this is the wrong Reddit thread. 

My dad left us, he walked away when I was small and we always believed Dad was the problem. My Mum was crazy, I feared for my life because of the fights. We lived with Mum. We didn‚Äôt see Dad. It‚Äôs only now I‚Äôm realising that my mum was the problem. 

I get severe flashbacks. Moments of torture and screaming, crying, desperately trying to understand. Haunting memories of violence. As an adult I‚Äôm now more understanding, my mum drank. My dad didn‚Äôt.

He‚Äôs in London now &amp; has been for the last 20 years, I live with my mum. She‚Äôs an alcoholic and as I grow older I realise that my childhood was blurred by her drinking habits.

I picked her up when she was drunk, I cleaned her sick, I called an ambulance at 8yo when she passed out, my friends were embarrassed by her drunken antics. My family took me in, my mum chose the bottle, my dad, didn‚Äôt want to know .

I‚Äôm here because I am a child of an alcoholic who believes she‚Äôs cured. I‚Äôm here because I don‚Äôt know how to process my childhood. I‚Äôm here for help.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Sooo, I‚Äôm almost 24 now, I‚Äôve been drinking extremely heavily ( anywhere from 6-18 beers a night every night for 2 years now) while I was drinking approx a year into it I started having pain in my right side near the rib cage area, slight shakes, gross floating stools always diarrhea that were commonly if not always pale in color, still ate well; still do. I went to the doctor and they told me my levels were really high for my liver, I was able to stabilize those levels by cutting down, really paying attention for about a month. Eating smoothies daily, eating beats and beat supplement, taking milk thistle you name it . But of course I fell back into old habits. about 6 months ago my blood pressure was regularly about 160/110 which I knew was related and caused me to be very hazy, irritable and no ability to relax at any point. I am on meds now which help a lot with that I am above normal for what it used to be because of the meds . More recently I‚Äôve had a real big wake up call within myself ( my two kids being my motivation ) and started drinking maybe 3-4 beers a night significantly cutting down with a end goal of 14-16 beers a week at max spaced out every other night. My overall health feels much better, I have more energy, increased appetite, no pain in my right side if I do it‚Äôs not noticeable, maybe less energy than usual but still a significant increase . But my stool is still considerably pale but no diarrhea. My end question here is with this drinking habit and current conditions mentioned above how fucked is my liver ? I can finally see the end of the tunnel and am having a lot of hindsight, which makes me ask these questions. If you have any questions ab current state of health or when I was drinking excessively please do ask id be happy to answer.",alcoholicsanonymous

"So, an old friend is slowly losing everything due to alcoholism.  Good guy who didn't ""cross the line"" until his mid 50's.  No kids, never married but in toxic relationships and had a good career.  Now he's broke, broken, won't clean his place or himself.  I got in touch with his family and others over the last couple years.  He'd get back on his feet occasionally but make poor decisions and end up in the same spot or worse.

The irony is he is one of the few non-AA people I confided in years ago when I got sober.  He helped me get through some things.  I know I'm powerless to help him but it just sucks to watch the plane go down.

His brother is going to see him tomorrow and hopefully he accepts help.

"Hello, I'm not an alcoholic but I recently baked a few pies using a pie crust recipe which includes vodka, and later realized that one of my dinner guests (who I don't know very well personally) is a recovered alcoholic whose been sober for a few years now. 

I really need some advice from people who are more knowledgeable. What should I do? It's way too late to make a separate dessert at this point, should I just inform the person privately and let them make their own decision? Maybe I can text his gf and ask what desserts he likes, and go out and buy something else? 

Is it okay to eat foods cooked with alcohol if the flavor of the dish is not affected at all? From my research, it seems that in a blind baked crust like this, there would only be 1/4 tsp alcohol left in the entire pie at the end of the process, at most.  

I feel like a jerk for overlooking this, but what's done is done, and I just want to handle it correctly from this point. I feel pretty uncomfortable asking him directly because I hardly know the guy, but if that's what I have to do, I'll do it.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hello. I (23M) am a uni student. I am an addict. I have known for a long time. I do not drink alcohol. I abuse marijuana and concentrate. I started when I was 15. At the time I was morbidly obese (almost300 lbs when I was 14.., im only 5'5'' so I was pretty big.) I lost weight after getting into drugs and alcohol. I did not stick with alcohol, only marijuana. I smoked absurd amounts...., I sold it to other students and spent all of my paycheck and the money my doctor mother gave me to smoke drugs over the past 8 years. 

The town I am in is small suburban midwestern with mostly wealthy community. I am not sure what the crowd will be like but I am very very scared and I do not want to go. I feel like it is something that I must do because I have literally tried to quit consuming cannabis and cannabis products over 100 times within the past 5 years or so. I was sober three or less months for three occasions for reasons outside of my control, then I relapsed.

"I really need help. Has anyone heard of an individual being obsessed with drinking - everything to do with it (the fact that you‚Äôre a drinker, the fun of learning about different glassware/other accessories, drinking the alcohol, disliking the thought of you not being a drinker, etc) but ultimately every time the person drinks, no matter how much (probably has Alcohol Intolerance) they get sick, whether it‚Äôs just nausea or full blown throwing up. This has been occurring for about 15 years. The person can stop consuming alcohol for long periods but still has the obsessions about it. Most recent step away from alcohol was for a little over a year. They did not try to sneak alcohol or drink in secret. But I‚Äôm assuming when the obsession of it got too strong asked if it was ok if they gave drinking another go (I just learned about this truth so I said ok because I didn‚Äôt really think they had a problem). This was all admitted to me a few days ago. So despite it making him sick (at low quantities and high) he would still continue to drink and if didn‚Äôt throw up naturally, he will make himself throw it up. I know he needs helps but is this alcoholism or more of an OCD thing or something else? Obviously it‚Äôs very self destructive. I could you use the insight and support. If anything needs to be explained better please ask. Thank you for listening and thank you for any help in advance.",alcoholicsanonymous

He went to two AA meetings and switched to non alcoholic beer but yesterday he came home and told me he ended up having a shot and a beer after work. I already resent this bar so much because of the decisions he‚Äôs made while there but I‚Äôm trying not to be so harsh.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôm just so upset - he was so adamant about cutting this out and then yesterday he tried justifying his choice like ‚Äúwhat if we go out to dinner and want a glass of wine? i can‚Äôt do this forever‚Äù

"I‚Äôll start by saying everyone I‚Äôve ever met in AA has been very kind. 

Unfortunately, however, I‚Äôm struggling to find a sponsor who‚Äôll just go through the steps with me as they appear in the book. I understand the importance of meetings and I‚Äôm not particularly averse to them. I am averse to the quantity that‚Äôs being pushed onto me. I‚Äôm shy, I find them draining, and I know in my heart that 90 in 90 would wear me down to the point that I‚Äôd be in real danger of drinking. It has happened before. I can tell when I‚Äôve been to too many meetings because I get thrown off kilter and my mental state goes west.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know where to meet a potential sponsor but at a meeting. And everyone I encounter seems to be of the ‚Äúmeeting makers make it‚Äù school, which just isn‚Äôt true and definitely isn‚Äôt appropriate for me. I‚Äôve read the book, and nowhere in it does it say anything about inhaling meetings.

I‚Äôm ready to turn this shit over to God. I want to do the steps. I strongly believe in the idea of one alcoholic talking to another, but everyone I talk to keeps pushing this over complicated narrative that‚Äôs not part of the program and it‚Äôs honestly just confusing the hell out of me.

I know I don‚Äôt have to take these suggestions about going to meetings, but I think I‚Äôd find it difficult to work with a sponsor whose only solution to any given problem is to go to an absurd number of meetings and call an absurd number of people who will give the same advice.

Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not going to stop going to meetings. Meetings are good, and I‚Äôm not opposed to meetings as a suggestion, just the suggestion of literally hundreds as a magical cure-all. Also, power to those for whom 90 in 90 works. I‚Äôm just not interested in it.

I‚Äôm sorry that this was very long winded, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have to offer on how to find a sponsor who‚Äôd appreciate this, or even just how to sensitively lay down to a meeting pusher that I want to do it how the book says without the additional stuff that I don‚Äôt find necessary or helpful.",alcoholicsanonymous

"After at least a year of fighting and delaying going to AA, I finally went. I've been to about 10 Zoom meetings so far. 

I've been working the first step and it has been quite the experience. For the first time in years, I sat down and wrote a list of how much chaos and destruction alcohol has caused in my life. Many emotions that have been covered with alcohol are resurfacing and I'm learning to deal with these emotions the best way I can. 

I knew I had a problem for years. I would sometimes joke about it to cover up how I truly was feeling. When people would talk to me about their concerns, I would yell at them. That was until someone finally convinced me to go. I didn't yell, I didn't cuss her out, I simply said ""OK"" and I picked a date to go. Same person sent me a text the night before the selected date to remind me to go. 

Even though I was aware I had a problem, I didn't realize how much the bottle had me in its grasp till I started going to meetings and wrote down that list. It's been a rough but healing week.

"I have been through, in my opinion, minor things. Cheated on but feel like I'm forced to stay even though I still love her. Made to feel like I was going crazy when it was all happening. I'd point something out we'd talk about it. That would turn into a majer argument and it would end with me being the ahole. Feel like I'm forced because she says if I leave she's going to kill her self. Now she says that if I leave then she won't leave the house. That she has to stay for the kids and accuses me of not loving them because I want to break up the family. I really can't talk to anyone because she got on me about talking to friends and family about my issue when I found out she was cheating. I was basically trying to get help from close ones but she made me feel bad because they shouldn't know our personal business. Also when I've talked to her she has come back and said I complain to much, I'm only trying to make people feel bad for me and that I'm just having a pity party. So now I kinda refuse to talk to anyone about anything. 

Manipulated by my mom now that I look back at my childhood. Well I think it's manipulation, she said she would kill herself if I ever acted like my brother and dad. Witch mainly ment if I was mean to her since that's how she said they would treat her. 

May or may not have been touched as a child. I feel like it's just a nightmare now when I think about it. I'm confused if it actually ever really happened. 

I have never really drank as much as I do now. Did drugs, smoked weed and drank at a young age but it's never got this bad till after the pandemic. 

I know, well think, those could be some causes but feel like people have gone through worse and never went this route. My mental state isn't really all that good but for the reasons listed above I don't really have the will power to talk to anyone. Now that I'm writing this I'm kinda scared my wife will look through my phone and see the post. Then make me feel like an ahole because I told reddit this then go on about how she ruined my life. That's what usually happens. I kinda see it as manipulation but when I brought that up to her, of course, she made me feel bad. I can't remember how because, of course,  i was drunk. Even though I was drunk, i do remember the feeling of it being my fault. This is kind of a rant at this point but it feels good to get it off my chest.

 For anyone who's wondering, I drink 4-6 drinks a day. Witch are 8% alcohol because I can get a buzz faster.

Again, for anyone who's wondering,  the cheating happened about 6 years ago. Since then though, she texted my best friend about things that shouldn't have been talked about between my bf and wife. She proceeded to lie about it till I got some of the truth from him. That happened 3 years after she cheated. Then recently she texted a friend of mine that I told her I didn't want her texting privately. I had accuses to her messanger and would go and read there convos. Fucked up yeah I know. Anyway, I asked her not to privately text him. Just so happen to find out they were texting and yeah it wasn't just friend talk either. That's about the 6 year mark witch happenedabout 2 months ago. So kinda seems like a trend.

Anyway back to my question.. I really feel like that has nothing to do with it. Maybe it does and I just can't see it since I feel like a shit father, husband and man. Maybe I'm just using all that as an excuse to be an alcoholic.",alcoholicsanonymous
"So, I post this not to seek attention or anything like that.

I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm doing is straight up alcoholic; on the road there to, or normal consumption.

I usually enjoy a drink or 3 on weekdays after work to wind down, but on weekends I‚Äôll find myself finishing more than a bottle of hard liquor a day. I start drinking at 3-4 pm untill I fall asleep at 1 to 2 am. This only happens when I have no responsibilities or obligations the following day.

I‚Äôve heard and seen what alcoholism can do to one‚Äôs life, and I want to avoid drifting down that lane.

Is this behavior normal in a wider sense of the term; or is it indicative of an underlying addiction or dependence?

Again, I am genuinely asking advice and don‚Äôt wish to cause any undue argument, debate or controversy.",alcoholicsanonymous

Whenever I talk about it he goes 'don't worry I'll find somewhere else to live' but he has got nowhere else to go as he has burnt to many bridges. He has also started using cocaine on occasion and as you can imagine he completely wipes himself out.

So my boyfriend is an alcoholic and has not had a drink in the past month! I‚Äôm very happy for him but would like some advice. I stupidly didn‚Äôt do much research on alcoholism so I wasn‚Äôt much help to him which makes me feel terrible. For example when he acknowledged the problem and cut back he would still have a few beers a night. I did not stop him cause I didn‚Äôt want him to have withdrawals and he does say he can control how much he drinks. Now that he has stopped the past month I was wondering what to do if he try‚Äôs and have a drink? Every where I‚Äôve looked pretty much says an alcoholic cannot control themselves and I believe this to be true with him. He always asks me first if he can drink which makes me feel bad cause I do not want to control him but don‚Äôt want to encourage it. Like I said he isn‚Äôt currently drinking which I amazing but I want to be prepared for the future if something does occur and I want to be able to help any way possible.

Finally, we begin to see that all people, including ourselves, are to some extent emotionally ill as well as frequently wrong, and then we approach true tolerance and see what real love for our fellows actually means.

The thought occurred to me that all people are emotionally ill to some extent.  How could we not be?  Who among us is spiritually perfect?  Who among us is physically perfect?  How could any of us be emotionally perfect?  Therefore, what else are we to do but bear with one another and treat each other as we would be treated in similar circumstances?  That is what love really is.

We don‚Äôt go out often so that was a few times a year. Other than that he would just have 1-3 beers a few nights a week. We found out he had narcolepsy and we think the alcohol makes it worse, which might be why he was falling asleep and peeing the bed when he drank. I‚Äôve also found that he‚Äôs watered down the alcohol bottles I keep in the house (which I‚Äôve gotten rid of). He said he did that because he was scared I‚Äôd get mad at him. A few months ago he had a few drinks after work and got into a car accident and almost died. We discussed it and he decided to take a few months off of drinking. I just found a new hidden empty beer bottle and I just feel hopeless. I feel like growing up with an alcoholic parent has clouded my judgment and like I might be blowing things out of proportion. I‚Äôm worried that me suffocating him is making it worse. He claimed that was his first and only beer in months because he was feeling overwhelmed.

Im falling back into bad habits but im beyond stressed out due to mental illness and relationships and fail to realize that drinking is only going to make it worse but yet it helps me relax so much and is the only thing that can numb the numbness if that makes sense. 

I feel for now its still manageable but im worried if this will get worse and turn back into drinking the hard stuff a quart a night like it was.

"Recently I was told by a member of the program I trust that was Malipulative. The exact quote was ""wow, your malipulative"". And its got me doing some deep reflecting on it, and I am not sure the word she used fits correctly.  So I am looking for added perspective to fully recongize this defect of character and work on it.   


Here is the full story.   


On Monday, I had planned to head up to clean the club( prior to the meeting) that we have AA meetings at. I post on Facebook when I do so, so those who wish to stop in can and that there is someone there if they should need them. (I care little about my Anonymity ) One member of the fellowship called me and asked if I could pick him up and he would help me clean. Now this was a voicemail and I at first was only going to pick him up because it was the right thing to do, not that I wanted to. Then I realized that if I picked him up, he would get tired after a few minutes of cleaning make an excuse, then leave and then he wouldn't attend the meeting. So then I became happy to pick him up and did so.   


Now, I pick him and he immediate remembers some errand he needs to run and I drop him off at the errand and he says he will meet me at the club when he is done to help. I get to the club and I clean. He gets there right when I have two things left to do, vacuum and santizing chairs. I ask him to vacuum since I wanted to make sure the chairs were santized correctly. He vacuums for a few minutes breaks the vaccum, then starts another cleaning activity. Then after the cleaning activity which was only a few minutes, he states he needs to go and I run him home. 

I get back and the 1st person for the meeting his arrived while I was gone. I tell her the rundown of what started as me explaining where I was(It was still pre meeting, but during the given time for fellowship) but turn a little into a venting session. Me, explaining running this person to the errand, then him breaking the vaccum, and making the excuse to leave. Then me saying how I knew he was going to do that when I picked him up. 

After that I got the response that I am malipulative. Which of course I was defensive about at first, but a little confused, since I did nothing to change the outcome I am not sure if Malipulative fits. I certainly have an defect here as I should never me happy that someone isn't attending a meeting I am chairing.  I have at least identified why I didn't want this person at the meeting. This person has mental illness that makes it hard for him understand inappropiate behavior and there is some boundry issues with him and women. Which Mondays meeting is majority women, I feel like I have to be on guard when he is there to make sure his behavior is in check, so he isn't making any of the ladies uncomfortable.",alcoholicsanonymous

With the self-discipline and insight gained from practicing Step Ten, I begin to know the gratifications of sobriety - not as mere abstinence from alcohol, but as recovery in every department of my life.  I renew hope, regenerate faith, and regain the dignity of self-respect.  I discover the word 'and' in the phrase 'and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.'  Reassured that I am no longer always wrong, I learn to accept myself as I am, with a new sense of the miracles of sobriety and serenity.

Obviously, the dilemma of the wanderer from faith is that of profound confusion.  He thinks himself lost to the comfort of any conviction at all.  He cannot attain in even a small degree the assurance of the believer, the agnostic, or the atheist.  He is the bewildered one.

The concept of God was one that I struggled with during my early years of sobriety.  The images that came to me, conjured from my past, were heavy with fear, rejection and condemnation.  Then I heard my friend Ed's image of a Higher Power: As a boy he had been allowed a litter of puppies, provided that he assume responsibility for their care.  Each morning he would find the unavoidable 'byproducts' of the puppies on the kitchen floor.  Despite frustration, Ed said he couldn't get angry because 'that's the nature of puppies.'  Ed felt that God viewed our defects and shortcomings with a similar understanding and warmth.  I've often found solace from my personal confusion in Ed's calming concept of God.

I love underground raves, parties, events, garage shows, concerts, etc. But I know I can‚Äôt go to any of these things that I‚Äôve revolved my life around for a long time because they‚Äôll trigger me. This is why I almost always tend to relapse on weekends and struggle to get past 20 days.

"Not asleep yet because I'm still riding a bit of high right now.

My home group is a bit different than others.  We're very relaxed but we need someone to have 3 months to chair a meeting and I had 3 months on the 18th.

Almost everyone was running late tonight including our secretary/kh but we still managed to get started on time.  I'm not going to lie and say that I was relaxed because I absolutely wasn't.  I helped to get set up in a rush while everyone was following us in and I was terrified that I was going to let down a group of people who have done so much for me.

I took my seat and got to have my sponsor on my right and my best friend on my left.  Tonight was my first home group meeting after passing that 3 month mark so instead of giving myself a chip, my best friend did the chips tonight and she was excited that she got to be the one to give me that chip.

We had newcomers tonight and I was incredibly nervous about giving them a really good, first time experience.  In the parking lot meeting after, I got to hear that they felt really welcomed.

I don't really know why I'm posting this.  Maybe it's just a sense of gratitude for everything that my home group and AA have given me, maybe it's for the first time chairs that are worried.

I told him what is going on today. I feel safer and I‚Äôm so glad I got one. I can‚Äôt do this alone. I‚Äôm pathetic. I‚Äôm like a baby. Needing someone to talk to every second of the day to escape my thoughts. I truly have a devil on one shoulder and a demon on the other, constantly fighting. Does the mental torture ever go away? What on earth will give me relief? Because I can‚Äôt keep drinking Red Bull all day. I‚Äôll just get addicted to caffeine. I know this. So idk why I‚Äôm doing it. My boyfriend said he can‚Äôt be with someone who will have to go to AA for the rest of their life. My heart broke in half. He then took it back and said he is just scared. So scared I will drink again one day. So, I am looking for advice.",alcoholicsanonymous

"READ THE AA LITERATURE, DON'T TAKE ADVICE FROM STRANGERS ONLINE OR IN THE ROOMS OF AA UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHO IS AN ALCOHOLIC AND WHO IS THERE FOR OTHER REASONS. AA is full of religious (not spiritual) zealots who want to ""take control of your life"".  The only thing a sponsor is for is going through the steps.  AA literature suggests strongly that sponsors let sponsees go back to the groups (ie: leave them alone after working the steps).

As a side note for new people, be very careful in AA.  Todays AA meetings are mostly street drug users.  ""Cousins to alcoholics"" as our literature states, but ""we should not be telling them they are members of AA"".  Criminal behavior comes with the street drug life, it takes a hell of a lot to get off most drugs than it does booze, so the bigshot AA'ers telling drug addicts their in the right place are killing addicts and killing AA.

Pick your meetings, vet your friends in AA.  Our groups in the last 5 years have had everything from ""members"" robbing members, a bunch of sexual assaults on new women, one shooting in the parking lot (dead) and assorted felonies and misdemeanors.

To all you spiritual people who will trash my comments, you would know about this stuff because the AA Grapevine (official magazine of AA) is finally printing stories about this problem, but there were less than 5,000 subscriptions to the Grapevine back in 2015, so most people will never see these.

Anyone tries to take over your life in AA, or pressure you into anything, tell them to take a hike.  AA published a yellow card for meetings in 2019, on criminal behavior, but most groups won't read it, it hits too close to home.  The reason for the warning card is AA New York has been named in a bunch of lawsuits mostly by women assaulted by other members.  This is not a new story, it goes back to Mr Wilson example in sobriety.

There a a lot of alternative today too, there may be a ""last house on the block"", but AA isn't it. Working on fourth decade, I've seen it all, and you were warned.

This is the first time I‚Äôm writing this.

I‚Äôve known this for years, but told myself every excuse in the books to deny it. 

In 2011-2015 I used to be addicted to cigarettes, alcohol, and cocaine. I quit 2/3 and told myself that was good enough. 

I come from a family of alcoholics on both sides- my mother died at 31, an alcoholic. My father has been one my entire life. Yet I drink. 

I don‚Äôt yet fully understand how or why I got here (became an alcoholic). But I‚Äôm trying to figure that out.

"Just speaking my mind here so please bear with me. I really hate to be a negative influence but I'm just reaching out for anything at this stage. Life here is on the verge of destruction right now, so any company is appreciated. 

I've become addicted to beer/alcohol. I know this because I can not function normally at this stage, and my mind is constantly wired with how to obtain the next drink. Nothing matters any longer apart from how I'll obtain the next beer. For all these years I thought it was 'just beers', but the reality is I've tricked myself into believing it wasn't an alcohol addiction. I have a beautiful, wonderful and kind-hearted wife who I've inflicted so much pain on with this, and I don't think I'm worthy of her any longer. Inside me I feel I've got to let her go and pay for this because I'll only just drag her down.¬†

"Hi there, I have been drinking in the last 5 years on a daily routine, around 2 liters of beer a day (six pack) sometimes more.

In the last two years my girlfriend encouraged me to stop drinking and made me understand that I might have a problem, and I started to reduce the amount of days a week that I was drinking until I reached 3 days a week.

Yet after sometime I just returned drinking as I used (only this time 6 days a week and not 7).

Half a year ago I stopped for a bit but I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal my consumption amount so I went at it again.

The last couple of months I started to wake up every day with the fear of ruining my health and that soon I‚Äôll do non reversal damage to myself, but at the end of each day I felt like it‚Äôs still not the time for me to stop, and that I‚Äôll do it in the future.

And then 14 days ago I bought myself 5 beers(half a liter each) planning to have a night drinking with myself, but then my friends went out and I joined them, I had 3 beers with them and went home and drank the entire 5 beers I bought earlier.

The morning after I felt like shit, and the realization that continuing this way will soon lead me to ruin my health if I didn‚Äôt do it by now.

It was Thursday morning that I decided to stop cold turkey, I told doctor about it and she sent me to do blood tests a few days later, and it seems I‚Äôm ok and I haven‚Äôt reached that point yet.

It‚Äôs now 192 hours since I did the blood tests and even though I‚Äôm ok I didn‚Äôt went back in to drinking because, well the anxiety I had about the damages I might have done to myself are very hard to forget and moreover, I don‚Äôt want to risk my health.

The withdrawal symptoms and the struggle I had to overcome in these days are obviously another story and this post is long enough by now so I will not expand about it.

I‚Äôm here because I really need an advice I got engaged two days ago, and all of my friends want to go out with me and celebrate, my parents wants me to come and raise a toast with them, I haven‚Äôt told anyone in my workplace that I got engaged because I‚Äôm afraid they will also want to go out and celebrate which means me drinking.

This pressure is really hard on me, I know for sure I cannot attend to all of this events, but to go out with my friend and celebrate is something that I want so much.

I‚Äôm considering to go out with them to celebrate and to drink in that single
occasion, but I‚Äôm really afraid that it will open the door for my old ways.

on one side I don‚Äôt see the harm in drinking with them once, which leads me to think maybe I can occasionally drink only when I go out? 

Like I‚Äôm really new at this and I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk with, the people around me know I drink a lot but since I‚Äôm only drinking beer and only after 10pm they don‚Äôt consider me alcohol abuser.

I will be happy to receive some advice",alcoholicsanonymous
"The last 7 days have been the best and hardest somehow at the same time. I am doing things that I haven‚Äôt done in the 6 months of me living in my new town b/c I am ‚Äòtoo tired‚Äô (hungover) or would rather be getting drunk instead. This morning I woke up and went to the cutest donut shop then to the farmers market (BEFORE 8)! Normally (at least 3x/week), I‚Äôm rolling out of bed rushing to work/class with a massive headache and sometimes after being sick. 

 I have started a really structured morning/evening routine and added church/meetings into my week. I feel more clear headed and motivated with my schoolwork which is not something I have felt in a very very long time.

However, do go from ecstatic to crying in literally minutes. I have thought primarily on getting/staying sober with little room for other thoughts. I have gotten so angry at anyone who can drink *normally*. I have been angry with myself. Everyone‚Äôs presences makes me happy, then pisses me right off. 

It has been a rollercoaster to say the least but this is the longest I have been sober in 5 years!! It feels like it‚Äôs been 2 months and 2 days all at the same time!

"Good morning, 

As the title states I am 99 days alcohol free. As I've been doing the steps with my sponsors I've noticed some things about myself and my relationships. There has been a lot of growth and I am really happy. Early in my sobriety I struggled. I grieved alcohol. Today I am not.

Today I think I am grieving something new... What my relationship used to be like with my parents. Our relationship is changing as I go through the program. I don't want to participate in negative talk and gossip about others. I want to be positive and ask God to take away my defects (step 7 is where I am at). I noticed the last time I spent time with my parents my mom snapped at me for something very small. Just your regular run of the mill passive aggressive, manipulative behavior. I found it hard not to go back to old responses... Stand up for myself. My dad tried talking to me about something I didn't want to gossip about. My response was, ""I don't care"". I felt bad. I was beating myself up and feeling down about my response to my father. That it wasn't positive and I didn't participate in his shit talk...

I shouldn't feel bad because I don't want them to control me or make me feel like I'm bad mouthing everything. I just feel like I'm having to say goodbye to something and it feels like a loss. Like I'm grieving. I think that is what I am feeling. I want to figure this feeling out; not feel bad about it nor feel guilty. I feel guilt used to be my go to.

Anyone else struggle with their relationships changing and feeling loss after becoming sober?",alcoholicsanonymous
"(29f) I know I should maybe bring this up in a meeting as well and have also talked to my sponsor about it but it‚Äôs still gnawing at me. 

I‚Äôm not very close with my extended family. This mainly stems from a point of being abused by a cousin for an extended time when I temporarily lived with my grandparents. I didn‚Äôt feel like my aunts cared about me or wanted to protect me. This has spawned some resentment as an adult and I honestly can‚Äôt stand to be around them or any of my cousins for that matter. 

My grandma‚Äôs health started rapidly declining about a year ago. According to my mom, my aunts cancelled her life insurance policy and they‚Äôve been mismanaging her funds while she‚Äôs been hospitalized for the last year. Essentially there really is no money to bury her and my mom has been trying to save as much as she can now so that she can at least have a decent funeral. 

My mom is a very emotionally needy person and this has really thrown her over the edge. I currently live with her and I honestly have been no help at all. I‚Äôve been sober for about four months now but for the last six weeks I‚Äôve been spiraling through this very deep depression. I do the bare minimum to be functional most days which is just to make it to work and survive  the work day. That‚Äôs it. I haven‚Äôt really been able to step up and be more responsible with helping out like I was during my grandfather‚Äôs last days and i feel bad about it but I was drinking a lot then and stuffing my feelings which I‚Äôm not doing now. 

To make a long story short: my mom wants me to travel with her out of state to visit my grandma and assist with possibly getting her established in hospice. There is really no one else she can ask to help her and I just feel like emotionally I can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt be supportive to her. I can‚Äôt be strong now. Not drinking and trying to get a foothold in my 12 step program has felt hard enough. I‚Äôm not sure what to do and every time she talks about the situation I get so overwhelmed. Just looking for some strength, hope, and experience in regard to this.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I‚Äôm a 19yo university student in the U.K., I‚Äôve been drinking for a fair few years and have always been known as the drinker of the group. When lockdown started like others I started drinking more, it got to the point I was drinking every night and weekly was drinking about 3litres of vodka. 
I kept putting it down to ‚Äòuni experience‚Äô, but I genuinely cannot refuse a drink and every time I try to stop it‚Äôs like an urge telling me that just one won‚Äôt hurt. I live at home and mostly drink at night when everyone else is in bed, I‚Äôm usually myself during the day because of covid so if I have a hangover or want to have a day drink it‚Äôs easy for me to do so, but it‚Äôs always at night when I feel a real urge.
I go out every week with my friends, I think my body is getting tired of drinking as I was sick twice which has never happened to me before, the next day I nearly passed out and yet I still drank. The following day I was sick 3 times in 3 hours, I decided to come off drink for the week. Last night I struggled not to drink, I ended up just going to sleep but tonight I caved and had 3 drinks, I had water and food after but I actually feel vile- like I‚Äôm going to be sick. 
As I said, I drink every night, I always start before 12am, and usually stop whatever time I feel tired at. The amount of drinks range from about 3-10ish maybe, I noticed none of my classmates drink as much as I do and I‚Äôm starting to get concerned. 
I did notice that my drinking was starting to get out of hand, but again I put it down to uni experience which I now don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. The earliest I‚Äôve had a drink is 11am, before an exam about April time, it was tequila, I drank vodka for the rest of the day, but that‚Äôs about the only time I‚Äôve did something like that.  
I used to paint all the time, I loved it so much but I stopped because I was drinking so much during lockdown, I was drunk every night. 
I want to cut back drinking, but when I try I really struggle to, I try to distract myself but I keep thinking about how much better it would be if I had a drink whilst doing it. I‚Äôm really embarrassed and don‚Äôt want to speak to anyone I know about this which is why I‚Äôm asking peoples opinions on here. Idk if this is the start of a problem but if so I need it stopped now before it gets worse.

"This is more of a health question, and although I don't expect ""medical advice"" I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced similar. FWIW I'm 38, \~200 lbs, 5'11.

I used to be a tank maybe 18-28, over time I can't nearly drink as much and I got super sensitive. I figured it out, but still drank often. I'm the ""frat boy"" of my friend group, everyone associates me with a great time, the guy who forces everyone to do shots.

I never used to get hangovers, I used to be a completely high functioning alcoholic.

About a year ago I started getting rapid heart rate, anxiety, things I've never experienced before in and out of drinking. Prior to last year I never had a panic attack ever. Starting March of 2020 I drank very heavily because of lockdown, we made every night a drinking night, sometimes at much as 4-5 mixed drinks (doubles, maybe triples sometimes or if it was wine it was a bottle.

My heart rate was so insane at some points I thought I was having a cardiac event, I remember driving myself to the ER and it was 150bpm while I was just sitting in my car at a stoplight.

Eventually I realized alcohol played a huge role in this, I slowly started to cut back and even took as much as 4-5 weeks off completely. I started to deal with regular panic attacks, depersonalization, and weird head changes....

After adjusting my supplements, getting some blood work done and optimizing I feel just fine most of the time, probably 95%. My blood work shows no liver enzyme issues, but I know those dont check for things like pancreas issues, kidney, etc.

Now... here's the tricky part. If I want to have a couple of drinks, I feel normal while drinking just like I always did, but the next 2-3 days after are half-way-hell... anxiety &amp; panic even if its just like 3 beers, the next day or 3 are terrible.

The question: is this some sort of reaction because I've drank so heavily I've damaged an organ and now this is my body's response, I'm wondering if someone has dealt with this type of issue? Am I fine without alcohol but I'm dealing with AWS (alcohol withdraw symptom) when I drink each time?

Sometimes I have slightly elevated heart rate but I have high blood pressure so 85-90 is not abnormal necessarily. But again if I dont drink for 3-4 days, I'm not dealing with any anxiety, any depersonalization or otherwise.

I can't imagine what else would cause me to have severe adverse reactions the day (or 2-3) after drinking. Its mind boggling how I could drink 5-6 days a week before, several drinks and be fine, but now having 3 beers gives me anxiety the following 3 days? Anyone?",alcoholicsanonymous

I binge drank last night and the night before. Someone told me they consider me a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äùand I got triggered cause my best friend is dead, also the fact I have severe insomnia and performance anxiety around sleep, and my previous roommates traumatized me so it‚Äôs hard to let people know when they‚Äôre noisy but my roommate depriving me of sleep by slamming the door everyday at 5 through 6 am was giving me severe anxiety around bed time about falling to sleep, (it looks like she‚Äôs finally stopped doing that, but it took a long time for her to stop,) that contributed to a binge drink.

"I'm currently 41, I've drank off and on since I turned 21, light at first, but then heavy a few years later, like a liter of Jager a night. I ended up in the hospital with my BP at 230/187, my whole body went numb, I couldn't speak, I couldn't move at work. I stayed sober for 2 years, but then went back to it, just not as hard, wine coolers (hate the taste of beer). At about 28 I turned back to hard booze, mainly vodka. I'd buy 1.75 liters and go through it in 3 days, 2 days off, then back to it. I somehow managed to make it like that until I lost my job. Had to quit, which I did, cold turkey, somehow, had klonopin.   


After a year, I went back, got bored with life, back to vodka, same as before. Moved on to wine, because it was less hard, and managed that every night for a year. Finally got caught by my family, was forced to quit again, I managed it, not sure how, it was really rough the first 4 days. Once you got caught tho, the cravings seem to go away. Like you don't want to let people down.... I started back up at 39, to get off the alcohol, I turned to a drug called Tianeptine. I was on it for a year, no drinking, at that was the worse withdrawal I've ever had.... but it worked to stop my drinking. The next year, after experiencing such horrible withdrawal, I was sober.... but since the end of August, I've been constantly back on vodka. It has been 2 months, 1.75 liters every 4 days, one day, feel like crap, then back on it. I'm scared I've gone too hard this time and if I try to quit, I'm going to get the DT's. I do have depression and anxiety, and after 24 hours of not drinking, my anxiety is through the roof and my mind races with horrible thoughts.   


I can't afford to go to rehab, as I now can barely work after f'n up again. I'm afraid if I stop cold turkey, I will die.... but I know if I keep drinking, I will die. What is my best option? My friends and family have lost all hope in me after so many times failing. My liver function was somehow OK after my blood test in July. I need a way out of this. I need some advice. I'm determined to quit, but after 24 hours, I'm just such a mess, I have to drink something. I know that is just an excuse, but I'm scared to death about having a seizure and suffering the DTs.   


Any help, advice, wisdom would be greatly appreciated. BTW, I've never done any illegal drugs, just the gas station (Tianeptine) and alcohol. I didn't think it was that bad, but it is THAT bad.",alcoholicsanonymous

The principle that we shall find no enduring strength until we first admit complete defeat is the main taproot from which our whole Society has sprung and flowered.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 21-22

Defeated, and knowing it, I arrived at the doors of A.A., alone and afraid of the unknown.  A power outside of myself had picked me up off my bed, guided me to the phone book, then to the bus stop, and through the doors of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Once inside A.A. I experienced a sense of being loved and accepted, something I had not felt since early childhood.  May I never lose the sense of wonder I experienced on that first evening with A.A., the greatest event of my entire life.

"So, this is really hard for me to post. I've been thinking about it back and forth for about 6 months. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, but I'm also starting to believe that my way of thinking is an excuse as I won't have to deal with it that way. 

My story is as most people these days, trauma etc. I'm not sure though if that's why I'm drinking so much. As a 20 year old I could finish a bottle of wine during breakfast. I used to laugh at myself, thinking that I was ""cosplaying"" an alcoholic. It was silly and I felt in total control. It was a choice that I rarely made. So, rationally, I never thought about it as alcoholism. 

Life moved on, I'm close to 35 today. It started just before the pandemic. I took a glas of red wine every evening. I read an article that it was good for the heart and I thought that it'd be nice to enjoy some wine on my own. I told people at work that it was supposed to be good for the heart and several people asked me if I was an alcoholic. I was pretty upset as I thought that one glas of wine every evening shouldn't be considered anywhere near alcoholism. 

Anyway, covid landed like a bomb in the world and things changed. I started working from home, day one. It all started for me with zoom-parties with friends. We thought it'd be good fun to get drunk on zoom, play games and just enjoy each others company while getting drunk. In truth, I believe we all wanted an excuse to get drunk, and it felt more ""okay"" while talking to each other, pretending we had a party. Thing is though, I believe my friends stopped drinking after the call ended. They probably put the bottle back on the shelf, and went on with their lives. Me, on the other hand, continued. I drank until there was no more to consume. I never considered this alcoholism, just good fun. But - in time I drank more. It started with a glas of wine while cooking dinner. I looked forward to it all day. After a while It got so hard to wait until dinner that I grabbed wine just before I had to start with dinner, usually got so blackout drunk that I skipped dinner. And a while after that I grabbed it while woking my last hour. A while after that I grabbed a glas of wine during 2'o clock break. And then during lunch. And then just before lunch. And finally, I grabbed a beer instead of milk as my drink of choice during breakfast. 

So that's my backstory. Yesterday I spent my savings on alcohol. I couldn't take it being sober on a monday... because, mondays. I promised a friend to meet up in a few days to watch a movie, we talked about grabbing some wine before the movie. I can't afford the wine in a bar, so I'll probably get drunk just before I meet with her. I don't know why I can't watch the movie sober, I just feel that it's impossible. 

My relationship with alcohol has gotten so very intense. And I think it's showing even though no one dares to talk to me about it out loud. I've had friends mention alcoholism, as something they've come in contact with as a relative, friend or a colleague to an alcoholic. I can't help but think that they're trying to talk to me about it. Why else mention it? It's rarely been in context to whatever else we've been talking about. I've had my family talk to me about relatives that been alcoholics (which I never even knew until a few months ago), so it obviously runs in the family, though far back in history. It's as if everyone sees it but me. This has left me wondering, and thinking a lot about it. Are my habits the habits of an alcoholic? Or am I just a normal person who lost my footing for a while during the pandemic?

Sorry for the long post. I just feel lost at the moment and don't really know where to turn. And don't feel like talking about it with my friends.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I have a question that I'm hoping someone might be able to answer, I've looked around online and haven't found a satisfactory answer.  


Anyway I'd been drinking heavily for around 30 years, mostly binge drinking. About 2 months ago I ruined one relationship too many because of alcohol and decided to quit altogether. It's been 6 weeks so far. The first months symptoms were relatively mild, restless nights with the occasional brain fog during the day. The weird thing is it seems to be getting worse over time, nothing major, but I still have trouble sleeping and the brain fog and headaches are almost everyday now.

"about a year 1/2 ago when i was 17, i made the decision to get sober. it took some time for it to stick, but i am now 8 months sober. i met my bestfriend in treatment and my life instantly changed . she was the first real friendship i ever had, because in the past i was always the one who cares more, who loved more. but with her , everything was reciprocal. i like to think of her as my friend soulmate and i truly believe that she was always meant to be in my life. and then the worst thing possible happened. she was swimming in the ocean and she just... died. the past 6 weeks have been a major test of my sobriety. my heart feels shattered. i miss her more each day that goes by. i still look over at her bed in our room every morning, praying that this was all a sick nightmare. it feels pointless to continue doing life and sobriety without the other half of my heart, but i have to. not only for her, but for me, i need to continue living this life for her. idk where im going with this, but i dont really have anyone to talk to because she was always my person. i miss her so fucking much, and everything seems lonely. i wish this pain would just go away, im not strong enough for this.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I have four days. I‚Äôve gone to a meeting everyday for those four days. I‚Äôve confided in a friend, my brother &amp; my partner that I‚Äôm struggling and need help‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm struggling deeply with really *believing* the first step‚Ä¶that I‚Äôm powerless over alcohol.

Even though I know exactly what I did 4 days ago that got me to this point. And I know what happened two weeks before that and a week before that. I thought I had drinking under control and honestly hidden, suppressed and avoided all the wreckage that was headed my way pre-pandemic. The pandemic oddly provided a respite. I replaced drinking heavily with weed and food and sometimes even just happy joyful moments with friends. But lately the stressors have started to pick up the pace and so again has my drinking. The time between huge fuck ups has decreased and the magnitude of the fuck ups has increased at such an astonishingly fast rate. 

And yet I walked into the meeting today feeling like a fraud‚Ä¶.like I‚Äôm just being dramatic and want attention and that‚Äôs why I was in that meeting. I couldn‚Äôt say I was an alcoholic out loud. I think that there is a chance I might not be an alcoholic because I don‚Äôt drink every day. I still have a great job and a car and a good credit score. I feel like a fraud being in that room and then simultaneously feel like a fraud outside of the room because I can‚Äôt admit out loud all the fucked up shit I‚Äôve done while drinking.

I just want to forget what I‚Äôve done and move on. I know the people I‚Äôve told will probably give me a pass. But those same people I‚Äôve hurt the most and will definitely lose if I keep fucking up like this.

"Hey all!

Its my Day10. Its 4am here, wide awake, excited to start new day.

I start to have clarity in my mind and I feel very positive, very happy. I have relapsed numerous times, mostly due to going too fast and being too hyped (or anxiety), or just attending a wedding/funeral saying I can handle. 

Well I can not handle, not even a drop. So my goal is full sobriety today, for the rest of my life every day.

I have always seen AA something which will not work for me. But this time I am willing to try everything. And also, I met a sponsor through this channel. Promised to think about AA somewhere around day12 when I sober up and think straight... time has come for that...

I would love to hear your experiences about virtual AA meetings. If I join, I would like it best if there are people around the world. I have always travelled, so this is something I could really find also motivating apart from AA 12 steps.

Hope some of you have experience and can share these...

"Disclaimer: I have made a new account so I could post this however I have been on reddit for a number of years.

I (25M) have been drinking since I was 14 years old. I have never felt I have had an issue with alcohol before as I always knew when I had enough. However, over the last couple of years I honestly do not know when to stop.

This has led to a number of black outs recently where I find myself not remembering anything from the night before.  When I go for a drink it can never just be one, I find myself saying ""just one more"" then before I know it I am still in the pub/bar till closing. Even this is not enough as I constantly find myself drinking after I arrive home from the pub.

This isn't just a weekend thing either, I find it hard to just have one drink even though I am working the next day. 

This weekend though, I think I have finally had a breakthrough. Like many weekends before I started drinking on the Friday and continued into early Sunday afternoon. I have very little memory from this weekend and although I have been reassured that I did nothing of interest or make a fool of myself ( I usually do ) it is not a nice feeling knowing that I do not have any memory of the weekend whatsoever.

But it's enough to piss off my family and enough of a problem to make me reach out to a bunch of strangers on the internet.

I guess I'm asking myself the question, is it actually alcoholism. I always thought it was a lack of maturity, some lingering adolescence. Maybe I still do think that. Yesterday I went too far again, drank too much and wound up my father in law at the dinner table. Repercussions aside, something about yesterday was a step too far for me too. I knew I shouldn't have, but I did it anyway, with family around. I admit that I don't have enough control.

I've been reading this group which is helpful although not necessarily what I wanted to hear hehe. Been reading about AUD, I'd like to think I can learn that control.

"Hey guys,

Thank you for your replies. 

4 months ago Mom visited, saw me taper and go thru hell at home detoxing. 


Sober 100+ days. Asked her to promise not to drink when she comes to visit. She said yes. Then I can tell she's drinking here. She has extra anxiety provoking energy in day. And bubbly at night. 

I thought I could handle it and didn't say anything. Well it was too much and I drank, got psyical addicted and tapered and sober day 3 or 4 today. 

Asked her to apologize for brining booze in house breaking her promise. She won't. Says I should take responsibility for my drinking. Wrll yes I do, it's my fault, I took the first drink. But knowing there was booze in the house and dealing with the up n downs of her energy added alot of pressure and I drank. I own a biz, have 2 kids and wife, and alot of stressor. 

I don't think me taking responsibility for my drinking has anything to do whatsoever on her breaking her promise. I believe whole heartedly it was a huge trigger for me. Not an excuse, me and my gal know we can't drink. I would have never had mom visit If I knew she was drinking here. Even if she was sneaking it and not coming out of her room, I can feel it. I have empathic qualities and I am so so sensitive to my environment and actively make it the best I can to help me stay sober. 

I mean, my gal and I did our first ever sober 4 night vacay at the beach while mom watched our kids at home. We didn't drink and had such a good time. Neither of us knew if we could do the trip sober, but moment by moment we did. 

A promise is a promise. I wouldn't do herion in my room if I was visiting a hermon addict, if they asked me not to. I would keep my promise or not visit if I knew it was a deal breaker for the person I was visiting. Especially if I saw them shake and sweat and have crippling anxiety going thru withdrawals. 

Well mom and her sister, my aunt, don't believe their is anything to apologize for. Presumably because my drinking is on me. But I am careful as heck about my life choices and situations to give me the best possible chances to stay sober. 

She feels no remorse, just points finger back at me. I'm not saying I 100 drank because her and uts her fault, I am saying I know my triggers and limits and made my boundaries clear before letting her visit. 

I would love just some thoughts from anyone. Maybe I am wrong about everything. I could be of course. 

Like if she just quit smoking and she said I can't visit her if I smoke on the trip and I agree. Then I visit and smoke in my room anyway. Just seems like ya, I would be wrong to break my promise and feel some remorse and small responsibility for her relapse. Because if I didn't do that, she wouldn't of been around me smoking and smelling like smoke and sneaking off to smoke while we both know what I'm doing without saying it.

"I‚Äôm heading to a city for a work trip for a couple days this week. For 99% of the population this would be routine, but for me it‚Äôs incredibly anxiety filled. 

The last time I traveled for work, November 19-21 2019, I quit on my sobriety of 8 months, got shit faced every night and got lost in Washington, DC. 

Upon returning home, my spouse asked if I had been drinking. I don‚Äôt know if it was the guilt on my face or the stench of the hangover. I‚Äôve been sober since that day. 

I have a plan and my soul is at peace. May God give me the strength.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I'm an alcoholic, I've drank basically every day for the past decade. I stay away from liquor cause I know it will get away from me even worse, so I drink beer. I'm stuck in a loop that I think alcohol propagates, but also numbs. I only go to work, then go home and drink. I probably average around 10~ beers a day, sometimes more sometimes less. I've tried to quit many times by weening myself down 1 beer a day but every time I get to around 4 beers I relapse back to maybe 8 or 9. I'm not in a position to go to rehab or I would. I have bills to pay and a house to keep, with a kinda shitty job so I can't really leave work for that amount of time. I really want help but I can't really turn to my family for it (which is just my mom and dad) cause my dad is an alcoholic and my parents divorced over it. My mom would be understanding but I don't want to break her heart. If anyone would have some ideas how to improve myself and make the journey a little more doable it would be appreciated.",alcoholicsanonymous

"... And FINALLY, really working the steps. Wasn't ready until I was ready and now I'm ready. Some of us get to be in the 'sometimes slowly' category. The important thing is that it works - especially when you work it. It's not like I've been sitting around doing nothing while not drinking. Been doing lots of other practices - breathwork, meditation, yoga, sauna, cold water immersion, intense daily journaling, connecting with what I now consider my higher power - and during Covid I had the luxury of being able to spend almost all of last year in the woods/fishing/camping/exploring all the local places that are normally overrun with tourists (Alaska). Oh, and being of service chairing/hosting a weekly online Zoom meeting with my wife (20 years in the program). All of which set me up mentally/emotionally/spiritually, to now do the work of the steps for real. Which was good because when I caught Covid last month, it hit me hard (grateful for the vaccine - suspect I'd have died otherwise), and I came out of it with the worst depression I've had in years. I wallowed until my - much wiser - wife suggested I go back to basics and work the first three steps. Got myself a brand-new-old-school sponsor, and I've been working the program harder than anything I've worked at before. Not just half-stepping and playing lip service to it, but committing to it completely. Hey, got news for you folks that are on the fence - IT WORKS! After writing about 20 pages in step 4 (didn't know I had that much resentment!), I've started step 5 and looking forward to the rest of it. Have had just a hint of a taste of the comprehension of the word serenity, and I've even had a few precious moments of genuine peace. 

Thanks for reading this far, and may you be blessed in all your endeavors!",alcoholicsanonymous

So yeah, I got sober 6 years ago. Life was pretty sucky. Life was miserable. I had a ready made family that loved me, and supported me.  I had everything I ever wanted. A loyal and great woman, 2 daughters and a son. I had everything but the nice car, house, picket fence, and dog. But still drugs were all I gave a shit about. I mean, I cared and loved my family, sure.  But I loved the feelings drugs produced more. Then one day, drugs stopped producing those feelings that I loved. And suddenly, I could no longer deal with the world and the chaos I created. I knew how to be clean but didn‚Äôt know how to be sober. Didn‚Äôt know how to live life on life‚Äôs terms. My fix was no longer fixing a goddamn thing, in fact my fix was making things exponentially worse.  It‚Äôs a tricky spot to be in when you‚Äôre sick of living but too scared to die.  Suicide was contemplated, attempted, and failed. 

That day I failed for the last time and gave in to the notion that I had a problem, needed help, wanted help, and would succeed or die trying to get better. 6 years later I‚Äôm recovered. I have my off days sure, anxiety, depression, commitment problems, disdain for authority, still love starting chaos, saying things when I should bite my tongue, saying things incorrectly without regards to others feelings, posting shitty memes, and starting facebook dumpster fires. I‚Äôm not perfect. But now a days, I don‚Äôt really enjoy being the center of attention, I actually get anxious over it (no one who remembers the old me would ever believe that!).  Nowadays, I do have the nice car, the house, the picket fence, 2 cats and a dog!! It‚Äôs wild to me. 

Today was a huge day for me and my son. But in typical selfish me form, I‚Äôm concentrating on why it was so huge to me‚Ä¶Since little Pete was born I always wanted to take him to a NFL football game. And do all that cool shit you see other Dads doing with their kids on TV and in Movies. ALWAYS. But it always seemed like a pipe dream to me during my days of active addiction. Then I got clean and in my mind I made mental notes, a check list of sorts, of things I wanted to accomplish or at least try to accomplish.  I‚Äôve checked off a TON. And today was another one of them. Today was super special to me and I hope to my son too. We were gifted an opportunity from a random stranger to make this memory. And after the game on our drive home there was a homeless guy asking for money‚Ä¶me and Pete gave him a few bucks. I asked Pete if he knew why? He said ‚ÄúYou do good things so you get good things in return‚Äù. And I smiled and said ‚ÄúYes and no, dude.  We‚Äôre supposed to pay it forward and do good things without expectation of anything in return.  We had a blast today because someone did something nice for us and didn‚Äôt want anything in return, so we pay it forward like Lindsey Kozecke would always tell us to do‚Äù. Pete looked at me and said ‚ÄúAhhh I got ya, but he did want you to do something in return‚Ä¶he wanted you to take that video with him and send him pictures.‚Äù  I smiled and was like ‚ÄúDamn, touch√©‚Äù the kid is wise beyond his years, because even though we say we do good things for others without any expectation of anything in return and try to practice altruism‚Ä¶ultimately it is for some self-serving purpose no matter how minute it may be. For me, my self-serving purpose is to continue to be blessed enough to make these kind of memories with my family. Best part about being sober is there is no ‚Äúset‚Äù check list, it‚Äôs all tentative‚Ä¶we just keep adding to the list day by day. Thanks Lindsey, miss ya.

This isn‚Äôt to diminish the things I‚Äôve done with each of my daughters. We have our memories too. Individual and as a family unit. I hope when they see this they don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt love them or not proud of them. Trust me ladies, we‚Äôve checked off many on my list too! Proud of all my kids.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Thank you all for your comments last week. I had 14 days until a therapy appointment and didn't know if I could make it through sober. Well, not only did I make it through sober, I also have been to a meeting everyday this week and have even reached out to make a friend. I am doing so much better and it started with the messages on this sub. AA is amazing. I cannot put into words how grateful I am that I found this sub for those moments when I can't bring myself to reach out in person. Really, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Therapy tomorrow afternoon! I made it!",alcoholicsanonymous
"My dad (53) has always enjoyed a cocktail in the evenings. But he has ALWAYS been able to hold his liquor. I (26) was never aware of any issues growing up. My parents divorced when I was 12 and my dad lives on my grandparents property in a studio style cottage.

My grandpa (dads side) is addicted to any pain relief he can get his hands on. Primarily pills and pain patches, but alcohol will do if he can‚Äôt get his hands on his meds. He has been like that his entire life. His brother (my dads uncle) struggled with addiction as well. I‚Äôve never seen my dad take so much as an Advil. So I thought he escaped the genetic predisposition. 

Both my grandparents have health problems. My grandma more so is declining RAPIDLY and my dad is their primary caretaker since he lives there. It‚Äôs depressing to watch and exhausting to deal with. She‚Äôs on oxygen right now and it‚Äôs really an ordeal to take her anywhere because she‚Äôs weak and can barely walk on her own let alone carry her oxygen.  Shes still working full time because my grandpa spent every penny they ever made. So they can‚Äôt afford to go into assisted living or have an aide come to the house. Nor do they ‚Äúwant‚Äù an aide. 

 I have begun noticing my dad is drinking a lot more. He was never visibly drunk when I was a kid, but now when I see him and he is drinking, he slurs some words or speaks a lot slower because he‚Äôs making sure he doesn‚Äôt slur. He uses excessive hand movements when storytelling. It‚Äôs just all too obvious that he‚Äôs wasted. I‚Äôve also noticed he has shaky hands even when I know he‚Äôs not drinking. I used to wonder if it was Parkinson‚Äôs. But now I think it‚Äôs from not drinking. 

My father, who is a very strong willed man, has opened up on a few occasions about the immense pressure he‚Äôs under taking care of my grandparents. He‚Äôs working full time, but coming home to make sure they‚Äôre cared for. His only peace of the day is when he‚Äôs asleep. Work is his escape from his responsibilities. But work is it‚Äôs own pressure. 

As far as I‚Äôm aware, he does not drink and go to work. But he drinks at night when he comes home. 

I‚Äôm worried, and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. It‚Äôs unlikely to stop while my grandparents are alive. I don‚Äôt even know what to say. I either tell him I‚Äôm worried and put MORE on his plate, or I say nothing and watch him drink.  Or I tell him I‚Äôm worried and expect him to stop drinking and just live with the pressure closing in on him? 

Any input appreciated",alcoholicsanonymous
"I tried a handful of meetings right before COVID, even took a newcomers chip and eventually a 30 day chip. Would hang around before and after and no one came up and spoke to me about sobriety. Alcohol provided an outgoing personality that I don‚Äôt naturally have, and when sober I am beyond timid and quiet. I am scared and disappointed to even go back. I‚Äôve made contact with a sober friend and they promised a meeting with their sponsor and it seems everyone falls thru and I have literally no one to talk to‚Ä¶except my bourbon. That‚Äôs why I just started this account. I want someone to talk to, I want to be sober. I‚Äôm not an eloquent writer, not into details, just lonely and wondering if anyone else is too.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I‚Äôve been fortunate in that the obsession was lifted from me early on in sobriety. This month will be 4 years. I still have work to do and I still have a long list of amends I‚Äôm in the process of making. 

I got into a relationship recently, and it‚Äôs illuminated a lot of defects I‚Äôve been able to avoid by remaining single. It‚Äôs become even clearer to me how important completing my amends is, and how important it is to let go of my own will and have patience. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to date somebody who‚Äôs also a sober alcoholic. I like the fact that I‚Äôm dating a ‚Äúfun‚Äù girl, and I‚Äôve never felt any degree of insecurity over being sober in a social situation. But this relationship has really challenged me. I am finding myself having a tougher time than ever feeling comfortable in sobriety, and I even picked up smoking again (and quit again, and will smoke the off cigarette and have to go through the quitting process).

I don‚Äôt think my girlfriend is an alcoholic, but it‚Äôs really hard to say because I have such a distorted view of alcohol and the last thing I want to do is take somebody else‚Äôs inventory. 

She seemingly can stop once she starts, but drinks more nights than not and was easily the drunkest person at a gathering she had tonight. It shouldn‚Äôt bother me, but it does. All things equal I care about and enjoy her. 

How do I find the answer? How do I know what is too much for me? Does anyone have experience they can offer being in a similar place?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi Folks,

*Disclaimer: I made this account just to post here, but I‚Äôve been a Redditor for almost a decade.*

I am newly sober (yay!). I recognized I had a problem, told my wife, and got help. Went through a medical detox (I recommend this for hard core drinkers ready to quit), and now I‚Äôm in an Intense Outpatient Program (IOP). I realize that when my treatment program is complete, I‚Äôll need continued support. I have a therapist lined up, and I‚Äôve been to an AA meeting. I am/was planning on AA as a big part of recovery plan.

Here‚Äôs my issue and, as a newbie, I hope you guys can give me some direction/guidance. I am a hardcore atheist. I‚Äôve been an atheist activist for many years. I‚Äôve had some conversations about this with my therapist, but not to the extent I‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve read chapter 4 of the big book regarding this, and it didn‚Äôt give me a truly satisfying answer (besides being a painful read)

Some other points to give further context:

- I am going into this with an open heart and open mind.

- There are definitely elements in AA that I think are very valuable, and I believe can help me maintain my sobriety.

- The AA meeting I attended was very welcoming, but very religious. In their defense, a big part of that was that the topic was the prayer from *According to Bill* regarding step 3.


And some hurdles:

- I‚Äôve been studying philosophy for more than three decades. I know that we can‚Äôt generally just choose our beliefs. We‚Äôre either convinced or were not.

- I‚Äôm not sure what spiritually is. I‚Äôve never heard a coherent definition of spiritual. 

- I‚Äôve talked to folks who say that we can choose anything to be our higher power (someone even suggested a doorknob). If we‚Äôre just using things like that (not actual god(s)), aren‚Äôt we then really relying on ourselves? Something antithetical to the central tenet of AA?

- I was also told that this higher power had to be all-powerful and has to have the ability to enact the change that I‚Äôm not capable of. Is this true? It seems to contradict some of the point in the previous bullet.

Thank you, in advance, for any guidance you can give me. My responses might seem argumentative, or that I‚Äôm the very picture of Bill‚Äôs (mischaracterization) of what atheism is, but, I‚Äôm just being as honest as I can. If AA is not an option for me, I‚Äôd like to know sooner rather than later.",alcoholicsanonymous
"If this isn‚Äôt allowed, just delete it. I‚Äôm a casual drinker, unless some really bad shit goes down. Ive lost two friends in the past two years and almost killed myself drinking both times.

"I have almost 1 month sober and I‚Äôve shared like 2 times in some meetings back home and have felt like it was fine. In one of those meetings, I remember the speaker even said newcomers should feel free to share. But I went to a new meeting today and the chairperson went on a whole story about how people shouldn‚Äôt share after they get one year sober. It was directed at me because only one other person was there with 4 years. There were only THREE people at the meeting including myself and the chairperson so I didn‚Äôt think it would a big deal? I rarely share anyway but this turned me off. 

I was just wondering what some other groups‚Äô rules were or if this was a general rule. Thanks!",alcoholicsanonymous
"I have an addictive personality (shocker), I gave up alcohol for 2 years because I switched my addiction to working out and going to the gym.

But I just drank beer for 7 days straight after being depressed about my weight gain and out of sync with my daily gym routine. 

I need a kick in the ass before I completely go off the rails. My dad was a alcoholic and so was my grandfather. I feel I might fall in their tracks.

"Apparently there is such a thing and I feel all the feels. My pregnancy is going well and nausea is not treating me too badly. Today at AA I bawled mid session about our washing machine dying. Totally irrational, but ok, we are human‚Ä¶ Then my sponsor revealed that we would need to pause as sponsors family needed time with itself. Since sponsor is new to leading the group and no one else feels called to hold the space we will have no sessions until after Christmas.

Normally I am not religious but it just spoke to me.",alcoholicsanonymous
Well I did it 16 months 457 days down the drain. I got drunk! Didn‚Äôt take much to get me there either. I‚Äôm drinking now I figure what‚Äôs the point. Haven‚Äôt called my sponsor haven‚Äôt told anyone. I‚Äôve been pretty happy sober and was working on my 8th step list. Not sure what exactly triggered it but I think it was the chair person Friday night. She‚Äôs a martyr and very arrogant over the death of her son. Tried to drag me into that shit because I too lost a son April 10 2020. She behaved in her typical arrogant holier than thou attitude. Was rude to another member who has been in since 1998 and she‚Äôs got 4 yrs. Then was sarcastic when others shared eye roll and chuckles. It really sent me off. I know it‚Äôs my problem not accepting her for who she is and I bought the bottle and I poured it down my throat. Oh well I guess we‚Äôll see if I can recover from this or if I even want to.,alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi, 
Could someone give me some advice please? I'll try and keep this short.
I went through a lot of trauma and have had underlying mental health issues since a child. Been alcohol dependant on and off for about ten years,I've had withdrawal seizures 34 to be exact, pancreatitis twice.
I got addmitted to hospital a week ago with severe chest pain turns out it was covid,they detoxed me with diazepam while I was there but no counciling or anything. 
My mother is a alcholic and my father a daily binge drinker and I currently live with them, I'm finding the cravings just so impossibly hard to beat! But logically I know nothing good will come of me relapsing. Every time I have detoxed my anxiety and depression comes back ten fold I try to get help but am just given anti depressants. I have a worker but she's on annual leave for two weeks and doesn't even know I've been detoxed and my other worker can't see me for a week and half minmum yet I don't know how to get through tonight.
ANY advice would be really appreciated
Thank you
Kind regards",alcoholicsanonymous

How come you don't drink anymore? 

""How come you don't drink anymore?"" a renewed acquaintance from long ago asked the other day.
""Anymore than who?, I asked.
""I mean any longer. How come you don't drink anything these days?""
""Drink? I drink...coffee, milk, juice, tea, soda pop, water...""

""I mean drink"" he said. "" you know, booze.""
""Oh, booze, No I don't drink booze any more, you're right,"" I said, I couldn't' trust it anymore. It turned on me. Once my friend, it became my enemy.""

""Maybe you got a bad batch."" he said.

""No the sauce is the same. I changed. Because I have this illness of alcoholism, my tolerance weakened. Alcoholism doesn't come in bottles, it comes in people.""

""Sounds pretty confusing"" the fellow said

""You think you're confused,"" I said, ""You should have seen me. I drank for happiness and became unhappy... I drank for joy and became miserable... I drank to be outgoing and became self centered... I drank for sociability and became argumentative and lonely."" I drank for sophistication and became rude and obnoxious...I drank for friendship and made enemies... I drank to soften sorrow and wallowed in self pity... I drank for sleep and awakened without rest.

I drank for strength and felt weak.. I drank medicinally and got sick.. I drank because I thought my job called for it and I lost my job.. I drank for relaxation and got the shakes.. I drank for confidence and became uncertain.. I drank for courage and became afraid.. I drank for assurance and became doubtful... I drank to stimulate thought and blacked out... I drank to make conversation and it tied my tongue... I drank for warmth and lost my cool. I drank for coolness and lost my warmth... I drank to feel heaven and came to know hell. I drank to forget and became haunted. I drank for freedom and became a slave...I drank to erase problems and saw them multiply... I drank to cope with life and invited death ..or worse... I drank because I had the right and everything turned out wrong..

""Gosh!"" My friend exclaimed, ""That must have taken a bunch of booze to get you in that shape. 
""Just one"" I told him, ""The first one. For me one is too many, and a thousand is not enough."" 
""So that is why you don't drink anymore...?

""Yep, I make it a rule, I DON'T DRINK WHILE I'M SOBER!""",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hey everyone,

A little over a month ago I had posted about how I had engaged in gossip (character assassination), and how I had had to endure the consequences of that. Some people in the fellowship had turned against me. I basically ended up leaving AA as a whole. I quit all my service positions and left my sponsor. 

A few days after leaving, my hands started to get all sweaty and my thoughts started racing the way I used to before I was in the program. I actually got trembling hands. It actually felt as if I was going through alcohol withdrawal. 

I basically  had 2 options: relapse or be a dry drunk, or go back to AA. I live in the relatively small town with a rather small AA fellowship, so it's pretty impossible to go to completely different meetings and never run into those people again. I contacted my old sponsor and she's my sponsor again. I've also resumed my service positions. 

I haven't apart from to my sponsor though, I haven't really made amends yet because the people I had issues with have somehow disappeared. For two of them it doesn't really surprise me they were primarily in NA and I'm in AA. But one came to lots of AA meetings too and I haven't seen her since. I'm sure she'll be back though. It's strange though, I wonder where those people have gone.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Alright so...

I had a problem with drinking in the first half of the year and a medical problem that (seemed at first) life threatening forced me to quit, with my family's support.

Recently I've had to move to a different city alone and after a particularly stressful day decided it would be good to celebrate my health progress with a few glasses of wine 

I was irritable, felt my head hurt, thought I'd be relaxed enough to sleep but just got more uncomfortable, everything about my body felt wrong.
The first half glass felt okay, I could imagine it helping me get more social if I was with friends but after that? WHY DID I LIKE THIS SHIT 

ITS HORRIBLE. MY HEAD HURT. I WAS TOSSING AND TURNING TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP.

I thought this would help me relax and it didn't?

I guess this is good, it seems I've finally managed to get more normal in my affinity for Alcohol.

Just wanted to share.",alcoholicsanonymous

How do I maintain my spiritual condition?  For me it's quite simple: on a daily basis I ask my Higher Power to grant me the gift of sobriety for that day!  I have talked to many alcoholics who have gone back to drinking and I always ask them: 'Did you pray for sobriety the day you took your first drink?'  Not one of them said yes.  As I practice Step Ten and try to keep my house in order on a daily basis, I have the knowledge that if I ask for a daily reprieve, it will be granted.

I slowly each night drank more and more. earlier this year I upped my drinking to a 1.75ml bottle of Jameson every 4 days. last week I caught myself drinking a 1.75L every 2 days and realized I couldn't be sober for longer than 3 or 4 hours without extreme symptoms.

I kept trying to explain that I didn‚Äôt like how he set a trap for me to fall into and that it was a little manipulative. I also mentioned that I talked about it with my therapist and people at my IOP, who agreed with me. 

Then he says in a playground teasing baby voice ‚ÄúAwww you went and told your therapist? And you told all your little friends at [IOP]?‚Äù

"5 years ago met a girl in a drug rehabilitation program (romantic I know).... Had some of the most amazing times of my life. But, also some of the craziest. Relapse, after relapse (shooting heroin) homelessness, saved her life probably 20 plus times from overdoses ( narcan, hospitals,cpr) she probably saved mine 10 plus times as well. We use to have people pay us to have sex in front of them while they masturbate. Homeless on east and west coast. We both were accomplished musicians busking in the city for money while dopesick. In between these times were some sustained periods of sobriety and something that resembled normalcy. We had a son, he was conceived in California. We came back east for the pregnancy, got at an apartment and six weeks after he was born our apartment building burned down (we were in the building when it caught on fire.. Thankfully, we escaped with our son but we lost all our possessions. We moved into her parents house and relapsed hard and after some time went to treatment. During the process we broke up for 6 months and then tried to work it out. But it seemed like too much damage had been done. She broke up with me and started dating another guy 2 weeks later. She got an apartment 3 doors down (that I can see from my bedroom). It torments me I still love her. After 2 months she got pregnant with new guy. Came over my house told me she still loves me and thinks about being with me (while pregnant) asks me if she should get an abortion? I told her that's on her. She gets abortion goes back with other guy and acts like she never said the things she said. I'm so devastated. I'm handling it pretty well (all things considered).

Anyway this was years ago and I‚Äôve built a much stronger relationship with my parent, but I still feel the impact of everything that has happened.  Now, at this stage of my life my partner is a casual drinker (a glass of wine a week) and while I‚Äôve never been able to drink, it‚Äôs been causing a problem for us.  Again, she‚Äôs not excessive in the amount she drinks and it isn‚Äôt a problem like I would stress my childhood was, but regardless of me knowing that, I can‚Äôt help but get a pit in my stomach every time the subject of alcohol comes up or when we‚Äôre at an event and she has a drink or two.  The issue is, without meaning to I‚Äôve clearly acted differently with her after she‚Äôs been around alcohol and it‚Äôs causing a problem in our relationship.  Has anyone else gone through a similar experience or have any advice for me? Thank you all I appreciate the help",alcoholicsanonymous

"Whether you're confident or insecure, a genius or intellectually challenged, tall or short, fat or thin, bald or bestowed with a luscious mane, manic or depressed, anxious or laid back, or anything in between...

God designed us to be exactly who we are. Our self- perceived assets and shortcomings may be hard to grapple with. But what God bestowed us with are God's gifts to us. What we do with these qualities are our gifts back to God. The sooner we can accept and take accountability for the roles we have been given, the more readily we can embrace our journeys. 

I may not like being a sensitive person, but God likes it because it makes me compassionate. I may not see the value in my health problems, but God didn't create me this way for no reason. If I think about my challenges hard enough, I can see how they might be worked into qualities that benefit the world and make me a better person.

The next time you find yourself cursing your bad hair, your stutter, or those extra ten pounds, remember that they're not meaningless. Just like your ability to comfort a grieving friend, ace that biology exam, or bake the best cookies in town aren't, either. 

We struggle to see ourselves through God's lens rather than the world's, but which of these perspectives actually matters? I believe that when we die these confusing conditions will make more sense. But what if we could learn to accept the roles that we've been given before that? How would that change the quality of our lives, and the lives of those around us?

Today I encourage all of us to examine the possible meanings behind our many qualities. How can we use them to make the world a kinder, gentler, more beautiful place?

God thinks you're perfect exactly as we are. Who are we to question the roles God has assigned to us?",alcoholicsanonymous

"I'm so confused, and I'm not sure if I'm actually an alcoholic or what my problem is? 

I got arrested for 4th OWI in February and started going to AA meetings, but in the back of my mind there was always this little doubt telling me I want really an alcoholic and I'm being over dramatic and just want attention or something. I do relate in meetings, and people seem to relate with me when I share but this little seed of doubt has not gone away. 

I ended up relapsing in August after 6 months and struggled to stay sober for a full day all through September. September 28th I got drunk for the last time and started going to meetings again on the 29th. 

I typically drink 5-6 days a week, and I black out about half the time, maybe more, I'm not sure. At this point I mostly drink on my own at home because I'm afraid of blacking out in public, but that doesn't stop the shame and embarrassment I feel the next morning. Not to mention the drunk texts/ phone calls that I don't remember. 

The other day on this sub I made a comment about how ""when I try to control my drinking I can't enjoy it, and when I try to enjoy it I can't control it."" And another user here started telling me that I wasn't an alcoholic and they weren't sure why I wanted to be an alcoholic so badly and that ""my disabilities"" don't make me an alcoholic, and that alcoholics recognize each other and they don't see it with me. 

Other than depression and anxiety I don't have any known disabilities, and I'm just very confused now, mostly because they said things that I've always kind of thought were true, that I'm not actually an alcoholic, and I don't really belong in AA. 

I was feeling pretty good about my Sobriety until that altercation, now all I can think about is getting drunk to ""prove them wrong"" even though they're a stranger on the internet who is now blocked and will never know or care whether they were right or wrong. Basically, I'm just tired of arguing with myself about everything. I thought I was doing the right thing, now I feel like I'm just wasting people's time going to meetings and that I really don't belong there. 

I don't want to fight with the world. I don't want to be an alcoholic, if I can drink safely I would like to. I just don't know what to think anymore.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I think I finally see what I have to do. It really sucks that I can't get my way, but it will be okay. If God is everything, then I'll never be alone. I refuse to give up my sobriety. Am I an asshole for giving my boyfriend an ultimatum? God, I hope not. I just cannot be a part of a relationship where drinking is ok. I want to be sober. I want to live a useful life. I want to be joyous, happy and free. 

I know I can't talk to him while he's drinking, but as soon as I get the opportunity I know the words will come: either you join AA or I can't be with you anymore. 

I don't know what that will mean... will he move out? Will I? But it doesn't matter. I will no longer allow anything to come between me and my program. This is it. I'm standing at a turning point and I know that with God's help, and every friend I've made in the rooms, everything will be alright.

"I‚Äôve never been addicted to alcohol to the point where I need it every day or have gotten the shakes or any other withdrawal symptoms. It used to be a 50/50 chance though that I would binge until blackout and make an absolute fool of myself. A part of me thinks this is the addiction creeping in but the more optimistic side of me thinks I could seriously use it to benefit my life by improving my ability to socialize with friends.
 I feel like marijuana and porn have always disrupted my life the most. Those are constant addictions that never leave. Let‚Äôs just say I was to quit those and heal some trauma from my past to become a person that I am proud of. Would it then be okay to try drinking again?",alcoholicsanonymous
"I‚Äôve been in and out of AA for 20 years now, since I was ordered as a teen. But I‚Äôve only been working the program in earnest for about 2-3 years now. I have a sponsor, I work the steps, I do service, I go to meetings, I pray and meditate and try to live in the principles. I‚Äôm far from perfect in all these things, but I try. I work for my recovery like it‚Äôs life or death because it is. 
My sobriety is amazing. But, I can‚Äôt seem to make it more than 6 months before relapsing in my experience this far. 
I look and listen to those around me and they all seem to have this wonderful comradery that I‚Äôve never experienced in AA. Sure I have people I‚Äôm friendly with or would even consider friends, but I don‚Äôt feel as connected as others or as is described in the book. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if this disconnect is one of my missing pieces. I feel like I just don‚Äôt have it in me. It‚Äôs exhausting and there aren‚Äôt enough hours in the day to dedicate to trying to forge bonds with other alcoholics. 
For context I have my immediate family whom are at the tippy top of my ‚Äúpeople I‚Äôm close to‚Äù group and very few close friends‚Ä¶ partially because of my drinking and partially because I‚Äôve only ever had a limited amount of emotional availability to give others. 
So, I hear how great and important the bond is to others and wonder if I‚Äôm screwed if I can‚Äôt achieve that?

"There's one in every meeting.  Open discussions are the worst.  The chairperson asks for a topic, two seconds pass, and the gratitude guy jumps in with a shit eating smile saying ""you know what I'm going to bring up"", then follows with a gratitude topic.  He'll do it two or three days a week if you let him.  There's something sadistic about the way he introduces it as if it were punishment for someone not jumping into the fray with another topic.  Another form of forced family fun.

Don't get me wrong, I think gratitude is a good thing.  Sometimes I need to hear about it from others, but not from the gratitude guy.

"THROUGHOUT EACH DAY

This is not an overnight matter.  It should continue for our lifetime.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

During my early years in A.A. I saw Step Ten as a suggestion that I periodically look at my behavior and reactions.  If there was something wrong, I should admit it; if an apology was necessary, I should give one.  After a few years of sobriety I felt I should undertake a self-examination more frequently.  Not until several more years of sobriety had elapsed did I realize the full meaning of Step Ten, and the word 'continued.'  'Continued' does not mean occasionally, or frequently.  It means throughout each day.

" I think I finally get what the book means by self seeking

Well, this isn‚Äôt a philosophical debate about split words and picking apart the nuance of the book. I must admit I do enjoy that sort of thing. It‚Äôs just not what I‚Äôm going to be talking about here‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre welcome. Instead, this is a sort of fifth step.

I say, ‚Äúsort of‚Äù for two reasons. Primarily because it‚Äôs not a first fifth step. I‚Äôm one of those guys that upon ‚Äòfinishing‚Äô the steps loops back to the start and goes through it again. I do believe and practice my daily maintenance steps, but I also find it rewarding to slowly go back and focus on each step one at a time. 

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a sponsor right now, and I just moved so I let myself off the hook and decided not to share the fifth step. After all, the book says this step can be postponed. So I justified my fear with that excuse.

Some may say what I‚Äôm sharing here isn‚Äôt a fifth step at all. To them, I say, ‚Äúyup you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm probably confused.‚Äù Instead what this could be is a portion of our maintenance steps. It‚Äôs around steps 10 and 11 where the book suggests we ask ourselves if we have kept anything to ourselves which should be shared with another alcoholic.

The second reason I say this is only sort of a fifth step, is that a fifth step is when I share on the defects revealed by the fourth step. This is only about one defect because it flows from one resentment.

Tonight, I said the seventh step prayer as I thought I was on this step. Trust me I'm sick and tired of this defect. It‚Äôs unbearably painful and has caused repeated difficulty in my life. 

However, as I said the prayer I was hit with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I know I haven‚Äôt told anyone about this defect. I argued with myself at first, stating I talk about it all the time. Probably too much! People are tired of hearing about it at this point.

Here‚Äôs the thing. No matter how badly I would like it to count, complaining about the other person is not the same as revealing my defect. 

So here it is. My great big defect is self seeking.

Yup, I like sticking to the four categories the book lists, but don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not letting myself off that easily. I will elaborate and give specifics.

This term has produced great confusion for me. It sounds so much like selfishness it‚Äôs hard for me to conceptualize what it is. I think I get it now, and I think it‚Äôs my problem.

It started to make sense when I heard someone say they were seeking self in others. And that, my friends, is a definition I can work with. The instant I heard them say that I related.

It‚Äôs absolutely something I do and have done. Its resulted in so much headache and pain in my life. 

When I was 15 I had enough of my Dad. For the purpose of brevity, I‚Äôll keep the jist of that relationship to one sentence: he hurt me badly repeatedly. At 15 I said no and refused to return to his house. 

It was for my emotional well being and I do not regret the decision. It was the right call according to logic and reason.

Emotions, as we all know, don‚Äôt often accept reason and logic. Looking back on it I can see that rejecting my Father left me deeply wounded. I wanted so much from him. I wanted his love, approval, and respect. I wanted my Dad to be proud of me, and he simply wasn't.

If I take the book's suggestion to view the other person as sick, well maybe he just wasn‚Äôt capable of those things. Or more charitably, he wasn‚Äôt capable of displaying those things in a healthy and normal manner.

Regardless, I belive my father was an early example act of self seeking. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was perfectly normal for feeling those feelings. The self seeking aspect is that I was seeking my self worth in him. 

I‚Äôm not anything like a psychologist, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is a normal thing for a boy to do. How then can such a normal thing be a defect? Well, one answer comes from the 12 and 12: our natural healthy instincts can get out of whack over the course of life. 

Additionally, I don‚Äôt believe a defect is all that bad of a thing. That is to say, I don‚Äôt view defects as sin. They certainly can be, and frequently present themselves as such, but it‚Äôs my understanding that they are simply defects in my character. 

If I were a line of code it would be an error, and my divine developer would like my permission to correct it, so that I may function in line with my true nature. At this point in my program (no pun intended) it doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings (AS MUCH AS IT USED TO) to discover a new defect. 

After the age of father idolization came to an end, I got myself a high school sweetheart. She was my world. I ignored my friends, family, and school work to be with her. I thought I was in love with her. I wasn‚Äôt. Real love is something akin to admiring a moth that lands on your porch. You don‚Äôt grab it and make it yours forever. 

I did - metaphorically - grab that girl and try and make her mine forever. Self seeking. That searching for myself, my value, in her was not love, but a defect. A defect that made the end of the relationship unbearable.

It was at that time I began seeking comfort in a bottle.

The self seeking didn‚Äôt evaporate with the liquor. Instead, it carried on with numerous people. My drug dealer, my next girlfriend, and the girl after that, to name a few.

You might be wondering at this point if I‚Äôm confused and actually uncovered codependency. Well, maybe. I don‚Äôt think so, but I see where you're coming from because I‚Äôm wondering the same thing.

I don‚Äôt know that much about codependency, so my analysis is rudimentary at best. That being said, I think codependency is‚Ä¶ when you're dependent on another person. Perhaps self seeking, as I interpret it, can rise to a level of dependence.

Yet, at its core, I think self seeking is something you do to yourself. These instances I‚Äôm sharing about involve other people, but I don‚Äôt think that is a necessity of the defect. When I‚Äôm honest, as I can be with myself, I see that this defect also occurred with positions of status.

For example, I was raised Christian and went to a Christian school. I looked for value in my Christianity, and I don‚Äôt mean I found my self worth in my faith. I was not about that. I looked for value in the status of being ‚Äòholier' than my Christian peers. It was about the status of it.

I later did the same thing with my position in Boy Scouts - I will be the best Senior Patrol Leader not to help you, but to seek myself in that position of status. Then later as a stoner I let you know how I skipped work and class on April 20th, so I could validate my identity. When I got into shrooms I bragged about ego death - the irony was lost on me - to validate my self perception.

This brings us to the most recent time this defect burnt me. I lost a close friend. I want to tell you all the little petty things he did to me, and gripe and moan about him, but honestly, it doesn‚Äôt matter. In reality, he didn‚Äôt do anything too bad to me. 

He did some stuff and I did some stuff. We‚Äôve had arguments. We‚Äôve been dicks to each other from time to time. It happens when you‚Äôre that close to a person. 

He changed over the years and so did I. We got on each other's nerves more and more frequently because of those changes. I ended up getting a different job and moving. Now we don‚Äôt talk.

In the good old days, we had an inside joke about a certain number. It became his number. It seems that every time I look at a page number, the time, my phone‚Äôs battery, or a license plate I see the number, and I‚Äôm filled with anger. Every petty thing he ever did wrong comes rushing back to my mind.

It‚Äôs been months and I‚Äôm sick and tired of this resentment. 

The reason it hurts so damn bad is because I was absolutely  seeking myself in him. I remained his close friend for so long, not because I valued his company, but because I had to. After all, who is Burton Guster without Shawn Spencer? Who is Robin without Batman? ^((Nightwing)) Shaggy is just a stoner without scooby-doo.

It wasn‚Äôt fair of me to put that burden of self validation on anyone else's shoulders. It‚Äôs essentially a lie; a distortion of the truth. Rather than seeing who those people were, I saw who I wanted them to be. I can‚Äôt really get to know them if I‚Äôm seeing a mirage of who they are. Maybe I knew them well at one point in time, but I can‚Äôt watch them grow as a person when I‚Äôm, by nature of self seeking, only seeing the aspects of them that validate me.

This self seeking via another person limits my ability to be a good friend because I‚Äôm approaching the relationship selfishly. This aspect of the defect doesn‚Äôt really apply to institutions and status, but the next portion applies to everything.

Self seeking harms me. It keeps me from seeing the position or person as they really are. It‚Äôs the opposite of acceptance and a total lack of self respect. When I look for my value in external places it‚Äôs selling myself short. It‚Äôs robbing me of truly knowing myself.

I said earlier that I‚Äôm sick and tired of this defect. I am, but at the same time, I see why the book tells me to pause and review the other steps before moving on. I need them in order to take step six. In order to truly be willing to have this defect removed, I must be willing to truly experience reality. I must be willing to learn who I am. 

That terrifies this alcoholic.

It's only through using those first three steps can I possibly take the next two. 

Thank you for letting me share this.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hey guys. I‚Äôm 29.  I don‚Äôt want to drink everyday of my life, I have a job I have a commitment to and never want my drinking to be a hinderance to that. I never go to work hungover, I hate it. I only drink Friday and Saturday nights when I don‚Äôt have work the next day. But I look forward to drinking every weekend and not just a couple drinks, I want to get /drunk/ every weekend. Not to the point of being what you would say is ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù but enough to definitely be drunk and have experienced moments of being blacked out regularly. 

My struggle is that alcoholism runs in my family. My dad was (is? Idk I don‚Äôt see him a lot these days) an alcoholic and so was his dad. I reserve weekends to getting drunk, that‚Äôs what I look forward to. Only maybe one weekend every three weeks or so am I not in the mood. Most of the time if I have a couple of beers I want to continue until I get drunk and then stop. 

My bf likes to drink as well but his dad is an alcoholic and he doesn‚Äôt want to end up like him so I want to limit my drinking for his sake. 

I don‚Äôt want to consider myself an alcoholic but I want to know if my behavior puts me at risk and what I should do to stop it while I can. Thank you guys, I‚Äôm not quite sure where else to ask.",alcoholicsanonymous

"...thats how I ended up back on reddit, I was plugging that in to google - the results were posts from r/stopdrinking. So I created a new account and started [posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g26i1m/celebrating_18_months_just_went_through_my_post/) about my journey. That was around 4.5 years ago. 

Long story short, today I celebrate 3 years since I took a drink and it turns out, in order to stay stopped, I did need AA, I do need AA lol. I spent the first year and a half trying to get sober my way, I would go to AA but also hated it and its culty people trying to tell me what to do. Finally, I was so miserable from relapses, I decided to be full in and get a sponsor and work all the steps. For me, it was the only option I had left, my doctors and therapists couldn't keep me sober. 

Sorry for the click-baity title, but I'm sure a lot of you can relate. This isn't to say that AA is the end all for recovery, or that there aren't other ways to stay sober ( I love r/stopdrinking!). But for me, it's what ended up working as a long term solution, but it took me about 2.5 years to believe that. Sometimes quickly sometimes slowwwwwlllllyyyyy.

"My drinking career was quite short. A couple years only. During that time I was almost completely isolated from everyone and only seriously interacted with two people. I am autistic so I have no friends and haven‚Äôt for years. I had no real job except a very part-time one. Before coming to A.A. I only interacted with my mom, who I lived with off and on, and occasionally my dad through superficial interactions. 

So my list of people I harmed is very short. The main one being my mother who had to put up with me living with her while I was an emotional wreck. I owe her money, that‚Äôs easy. Other than that I just don‚Äôt know what to do except tell her I‚Äôm sorry and try to be helpful and kind to her.

"Hello guys, I need an advice on how to proceed with my loved one. I am sorry for my English in advance, it is not my first language. 

My mom was in a rehab for 4 weeks some at the begging of the year, today I arrived home for the weekend, normally I live in another town. Long story short she was stashing  alcohol in dirty laundry and actually drank it, we have breathalyzer at home so I checked. That made me sure. She is (in my opinion) drinking for some time- she's red and puffy, her voice is different on the phone we we talk. But she is refusing to admit it. She claimed that it is a one- time accident. But it can't be true, why the stashing then, and the fully empty bottle, she didn't drink it all now.

How can I best show her that she is an active addict right now, and how do I help her recover.

She also claims that it is possible for an alcoholic to be ""casual"" drinker after some time, is that true? I thought an addict is supposed to be sober for the rest of the life.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I don't want to. I have a sponsor and I've been sober for 33 days. It really sucks because I keep thinking about what my sponsor asked me when I asked her to sponsor me: are you done drinking? Do you have any lurking notions or desires?

But now, here I am. Feeling like total shit. Did I lie to myself? Or am I giving these thoughts too much attention? I'm praying asking God to keep me safe from the obsession. I'm more upset that my boyfriend asked me to relapse with him, but I'm not surprised.... like I know he's an alcoholic but unlike me he's not participating in AA. He's still smoking weed daily.

All I bought was a 4L boxed cooler as I know my boyfriend probably wouldn‚Äôt want to see me drunk, but he just keeps lecturing me about how I said I don‚Äôt want to drink anymore and about how easy it would‚Äôve been to just not drink and talking about all the times I was drunk before this past week. (I‚Äôve never done anything embarrassing or harmful to anyone when I drink, I‚Äôm pretty chill) he just hates that I drink because he doesn‚Äôt and the way he‚Äôs talking to me is really starting to hurt me.

I‚Äôve spent the last 20 days, one day at a time picking up the pieces. I‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôs been a bit too easy. I spent the first 2 days of sobriety in a hospital for detox before just leaving to get off the Ativan (paradoxical reaction had me feeling worse than drinking or being hung over). 
I was a heavy whiskey drinker (IMO) 1-2 pints a day, plus seltzers for chasers. While functioning, I was merely in auto pilot. I feared the physical withdrawal the worst and think that‚Äôs what kept me from being sober so long. 
I keep waiting for this overwhelming urge to drink and it hasn‚Äôt crept up yet, or I‚Äôve fought it well. I cant tell. I think of drinking often only to find it more habit than desire. I quickly remember the raging asshole that comes out when emotion surface while I‚Äôm shitfaced, or I hold on to the moments I‚Äôve been  blessed to be present in in the last 20 days, and suddenly the right choice becomes easy to make. 
Has anyone else‚Äôs sobriety seem almost too easy? Am I in for a jolt? A surprise? I‚Äôve been hearing the first 30 days are the hardest‚Ä¶ I fear letting my guard down. Is it possible to just decide I‚Äôve given enough time and years and money and energy to drinking and just be done with it? Am I fooling myself?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi Ive been sober for 17 days now and attending meetings.  Today I finally realized that one of my triggers for drinking is the stress my wife has.  In my eyes, she is stressing about silly/menial things.  She shares it with me and just makes me want to drink.  How can I tell her nicely that her stressing is a trigger for me for wanting to get drunk?",alcoholicsanonymous
"So my partner and I both go to meetings. He‚Äôs very very shy but he always tells me after what he would have said if he dared. 

He‚Äôs struggling with what do you do when you‚Äôve made being an alcoholic your kind of joke-y social identity, but now suddenly it‚Äôs serious? How do you handle when that was your whole gig? Your kind of social trade mark?",alcoholicsanonymous
"I made some mistakes in early sobriety because I was such a chaotic mess when I came into the rooms. I still kind of him to be honest but I‚Äôm truly trying to follow suggestions and stay much tighter with my sponsor. 
Long story short: I ended up having an inappropriate relationship with two different men in the program who both had significantly more time than me, 5 and 24 years respectively. Three months in I can see it as being a mistake and I feel like managing the emotions I have from these interactions has nearly costs me my sobriety dozens of times. 
At first, it was a big source of shame for me and I kept it a secret from my female friends in the program but eventually after just going through so much emotional turmoil I started to open up to people including my sponsor about what was going on.
I‚Äôve gotten mixed feedback. Often I hear I‚Äôve been a victim even though I initiated both interactions and other times I hear that I should‚Äôve been more focused on my sobriety and taking the suggestion not get involved in a relationship. 
I‚Äôm just at the point now where I feel so much anger and confusion. I am soooo uncomfortable around any man at the meetings now because I feel like now I‚Äôm constantly questioning their intentions even though most of the people I‚Äôve encountered are really good people who want me to do well. The men I was always with chair meeting and are on the board for our club. They sponsor other men and people  really look to them as examples and I just feel so disgusted at them for being hypocritical. 
I have the impulse to just want to put them publicly in meetings just out of spite. I know anger and resentment are awful for alcoholics but I‚Äôm not on the steps yet that will allow me to process that.  I just feel like these men knew where I was in in my program and they took actions knowing I wouldn‚Äôt even have the tools to properly cope with a falling out. 
I want to bring 13 stepping up in a meeting and I know my intentions aren‚Äôt right for wanting to do that but I just feel like I want justice and for everyone to know about these guys. 13 stepping is a really painful thing for the newcomer to process. I can speak for myself because I‚Äôm going through it now.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Was in a meeting one time and a guy asked ""can I drink non-alcoholic beer?"" An old-timer spoke up and said ""drinking non-alcoholic beer is like going down on your sister, it may taste the same but it's not a good idea!""

"I'm really struggling today. I haven't gotten a new sponsor yet, since coming back to the program a couple of weeks ago. According to one person on the internet though I'm not an alcoholic. Now all I want to do is go drink to see if they're right. Even though I've tested the theory time and time again. It's not worth drinking over... How many times do I have to say that before I believe it? Fuck it. I guess I'm not an alcoholic, I just like to drink more than I like my family, job, being able to drive, home, and health.

"*""When we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed crises we could not postpone or evade, we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either God is everything or else He is nothing. God either is or He isn‚Äôt. What was our choice to be?""* 

*""Actually we were fooling ourselves, for deep down in every man, woman, and child, is the fundamental idea of God. It may be obscured by calamity, by pomp, by worship of other things, but in some form or other it is there. For faith in a Power greater than ourselves, and miraculous demonstrations of that power in human lives, are facts as old as man himself.""* 

Both of mine are from Chapter 4, 'We Agnostics'. It's honestly my favorite chapter of the Big Book, however, it didn't always make sense to me. The first time I read it, I didn't actually comprehend what it was saying. And once I had read the chapter once I didn't have to read it again, right? 

So I stayed around for a couple weeks and I had my first spiritual experience. I didn't know that's what it was at the time, but looking back, it definitely was. 

I was leaving my usual meeting and as I got into my car an overwhelming wave of 'everything is going to be ok' washed over me. I felt completely accepted, like my AA hall was where I belonged my entire life. I was alone in my car and the emotions I was feeling were equivalent to my parents giving me a hug and telling me they loved me. 

Later, going through the steps with a sponsor, we get to chapter 4. I read it and get to those two quotes. And everything clicks. I finally know that I don't have to definitively know who or what my higher power is. I just have to know that it is. I'd felt that feeling I got in my car before, maybe not to that magnitude, but I'd felt it. So that's the fundamental  idea of God inside of me.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I'm new to AA, 8 days of sobriety. I've been to 2 online meetings so far and just have some questions.

2) Donations, is there a preferred amount? Is it proper to donate per meeting, weekly, monthly?

3) Sponsor, is this something I should seak out right away, or wait, get to know folks in the group and then ask?

Any help would be great! I may also be overthinking it...",alcoholicsanonymous
"MY CHECKLIST, NOT YOURS

Gossip barbed with our anger, a polite form of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us, too.  Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 67

Sometimes I don't realize that I gossiped about someone until the end of the day, when I take an inventory of the day's activities, and then, my gossiping appears like a blemish in my beautiful day.  How could I have said something like that?  Gossip shows its ugly head during a coffee break or lunch with business associates, or I may gossip during the evening, when I'm tired from the day's activities, and feel justified in bolstering my ego at the expense of someone else.  Character defects like gossip sneak into my life when I am not making a constant effort to work the Twelve Steps of recovery.  I need to remind myself that my uniqueness is the blessing of my being, and that applies equally to everyone who crosses my path in life's journey.  Today the only inventory I need to take is my own.  I'll leave judgment of others to the Final Judge - Divine Providence.

"I thought about making a throwaway account but screw it. 

I‚Äôve been able to be sober for about 10-11 months twice since I started drinking because I was pregnant with my two beautiful girls. PPD with my oldest didn‚Äôt help me at all and I‚Äôm not using it as an excuse. Nobody would listen to me. The antidepressants my doctor put me on made it worse. So, I said to hell with it and drank. My oldest was about a month-month and a half old. When I drank I wasn‚Äôt angry at everyone (minus my daughter‚Ä¶ my PPD never targeted her), myself or the world. It felt like everything just lifted off my shoulders and I finally felt somewhat normal. That should of been a massive red flag but I was so deep in my depression, a whole carnival of red flags could of been right in my face and I wouldn‚Äôt of even noticed it. I drank quite a bit before my oldest but after PPD, it got so much worse. 

Due to the PPD it took 6 years before I was finally ready to try for another child. I got pregnant pretty instantly. I‚Äôm talking within a month. ü§£ Unfortunately, we lost that one within a month. Two months later, we were gifted our rainbow. Again, sober whole pregnancy. She was a month old when I took that drink. I thought, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll have DH handle the kids and have a chill night and relax.‚Äù I look back now and laugh, not with humor but with disgust. It‚Äôs never just one night is it? She‚Äôll be five in five months.

I know I need to stop. Went two days without drinking this week which is a big deal for me. Then, last night, my bright self decided to just finish what was left of my little under half 5th of Jim Beam. It takes a lot to get me drunk anymore and I wasn‚Äôt drunk. Decent buzz but something happened when I laid down to go to bed. My heart was racing, my brain was going every which direction and I almost started crying because I realized I don‚Äôt like that feeling anymore. I felt out of control. I felt out of control with my body, my emotions. This is the first time where I‚Äôve said to myself, ‚ÄúIm done.‚Äù Im not even sad. Im not anxious about it and I have horrible anxiety. Im never calm! 

I live in a small town and really don‚Äôt want to attend AA meetings here but I can‚Äôt drive 45 minutes to the nearest town, either. I don‚Äôt care about seeing ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù or ‚ÄúMartha‚Äù at the grocery store. Im just a private person and I‚Äôm embarrassed and ashamed. I just wanted to know if there‚Äôs anyway to get a sponsor online and do online AA meetings where I don‚Äôt have to show my face. I‚Äôm talker and I need someone who understands and I can talk to on the bad days because I know they‚Äôre coming.

Sorry for the long post.",alcoholicsanonymous
Day 18!!! Closer to a month than 18 days ago. 18 more days than i thought I could do so this is just the beginning but I‚Äôm finding myself more and more everyday.

"To start off, i‚Äôm only 18. i know it‚Äôs way too young to get into this, and i hate it. But i used to smoke weed everyday all day from 13-17, i had to quit do to a medical reason, and that‚Äôs when i started drinking. Only occasionally, i had a few friends over 21 who could get me alcohol, it slowly started getting more and more. I would buy a bottle every other week and finish it myself. I can only drink when i‚Äôm at a friends house which i think has made me drink way less than i could‚Äôve. (if i could drink every single night i would) That was about 6 months ago, and now i buy a 1 Liter bottle every singe week. I drink about 3-4 a week, sometimes more. I still live with my parents, they went on a 2 week long vacation recently, and I got drunk 13 days in a row. that is when i realized i had a problem. However i can‚Äôt stop drinking, when i don‚Äôt get drunk i think about how fun it is to drink and just literally do anything. I drink to play video games, watch netflix, or even take a shower. I‚Äôve tried to stop, i even went out of my way to get a job that has me work very early mornings (3:00-8:00 am) to curb my drinking. But now i find myself drinking at 5-6 in the day. I‚Äôm going to cut down my drinking to only saturday night and sunday night, but i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll be able to do it, i know it will only get worse but right now when i‚Äôm not drunk I get upset, the things i love doing so much when i‚Äôm drunk have become mundane and i don‚Äôt enjoy them. i don‚Äôt know what to do.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I was sober for 14 months up until 2 months ago. I've experienced many hopeless moments since telling myself ""this is it. I cant do it anymore. I don't want to. god please help me"" and I really meant it. i've hurt someone I really care about and most importantly, ive hurt myself. 

I promised to not do this anymore, especially to the person ive hurt. then not even a week later, I do it again and its just as worse. I vow that night never again. then im drunk again in two days.

Im so lost. why cant I do it anymore. I hate myself. I really do. I cried for 3 hours the other day wondering wtf is wrong with me. I have the knowledge and I just cant stop.

I dont even know if I want to. I know its best and I hate myself when im drinking, but if I really wanted to, wouldnt I do everything to stop??

I've honestly made a lot of progress, and a major part of that was visiting this site and reading posts every single night. It hasn't been easy, that's for sure, but some days are easier than others. Today isn't one of those days. Today I got a call that a friend I've been avoiding for a couple of months put a bullet in his head. He was a heavy drinker and I knew for my own personal growth I needed space from that ""crowd"", for fear that I would relapse. Fuck this hurts. What a shitty friend I was. I've been told talking about this type of stuff is supposed to help, but I don't have anyone to talk to right now and the whiskey bottle is just downstairs. So this is my first post, hoping that writing it out helps and I can make it through the night.",alcoholicsanonymous

I‚Äôm 25 and Saturday will be my 90 days. I‚Äôve been attending a meeting since I was about a month sober. I really like it. The people are nice and it helps. Being sober isn‚Äôt easy but I feel like it‚Äôs been less of a struggle for than others. I feel bad because I haven‚Äôt really dived into the steps or gotten a sponsor. I attend 1 meeting a week. The first few weeks they were all stressing the 90 by 90. I might be able to go to more than 1 a week but I also work 7 days a week between 2 jobs. I‚Äôm also taking real estate courses. So I‚Äôm busy I get that it‚Äôs not an excuse. There‚Äôs also another reason I feel bad. I smoke weed a few times a week. Never on the day that I attend the meeting. But I still feel like a liar.

"I‚Äôm at 1 month, 12 days, 1 hour, and 38 minutes since I walked out of the ER after my final detox. 

Just about everything life could throw at me, it did, when I first got sober, and looking back, now, I figure if I could stay sober through that, and I did, I can stay sober through anything, and I will. 

I‚Äôve wrestled with alcohol addiction for about 25 years. Longest I was sober was around four years, or so, and then stress came toppling down and I had begun to believe I would be fine if I began to drink again. 

After four years of being sober, the little drunk inside my head was still as cunning, baffling, and powerful as it had ever been, but I let myself get complacent. 

The little drunk demon inside my head has pulled every trick in the book on me at various times throughout my life, so I have no illusions of what I‚Äôm up against. I also know, ultimately, I am in this alone, and sometimes I stay sober just to say ‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù to the universe. You won‚Äôt take me today. 

Working toward my 60 day chip, now, and I‚Äôll keep going until I collect them all. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I‚Äôm grateful to be sober, today. One month, twelve days, one hour, and forty-four minutes, now. 

To anyone reading this who might know me, I hope you‚Äôve all healed from the pain I caused you when I was drinking. I have nothing but love for all of you, here. As long as there is a tomorrow, there is hope. Never forget that.",alcoholicsanonymous

I lacked serenity.  With more to do than seemed possible, I fell further behind, no matter how hard I tried.  Worries about things not done yesterday and fear of tomorrow's deadlines denied me the calm I needed to be effective each day.  Before taking Steps Ten and Eleven, I began to read passages like the one cited above.  I tried to focus on God's will, not my problems, and to trust that He would manage my day.  It worked!  Slowly, but it worked!

"I‚Äôve had a problem with drugs/alcohol all my life. I started using when I was 13 and now I‚Äôm 17. When I was 15 I was forced into rehab where I stayed for 10 months. They rehab followed A.A. and The 12 Steps so over 10 months I learned a lot about the program and also started going to meetings. I put the minimum into the program and was dishonest the who way through. I had no interest towards sobriety and planned to start using again after I got out, which I did. I was relapsed for 5-6 months, got pretty bad and decided to go back to the rooms and get sober. Stayed sober for almost 4 months. Summer hit and once again I relapsed. This time it‚Äôs was mostly alcohol which I never really liked or used a lot before. I become very depressed and suicidal almost taking my life around the end of the summer. I think I must have hit a rock bottom cause somehow once again I got sober. A week after getting sober my older brother killed himself and I had never felt worse in my life and also had never experienced a death ever. At first I told my self sobriety was my most important priority and if I was too relapse I would probably end up joining him. It‚Äôs been about a month since he passed and I have stayed sober but I‚Äôm living in a dry drunk. I want to get back into the program but I have started to feel more comfortable being introverted and isolated. Today I found a lockbox hidden in a heater room with a couple bottles of pills that must have been from before rehab because I don‚Äôt remember having it. It‚Äôs only been 2 hours since I found them but I feel scared that I‚Äôm either gunna relapse or try and overdose. I just don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do anymore and even posting to Reddit I feel like a burden because alot of the time I feel like relying on anyone makes me weak and I‚Äôm already so so weak. The only reason I‚Äôm posting this is because I have never really spoke about this or how I‚Äôm truly feeling and wanna try something new because I know it‚Äôs the right thing to do especially if I can die I can die a little more peacefully knowing I tried to get and not feel alone anymore.",alcoholicsanonymous

"30 years of sobriety for which I am very thankful. 

I work outside the US and just found out my sponsor passed away earlier this year. So this is my tribute to him, I would not be alive today if it had not been for the guidance and dedication of Bill D. He was always there for me. 

I had planned to go back and visit my original home group and see him. It was not uncommon for us to go six months without talking, its just the way we were after so many years. Trying to get in touch was how I found out. 

Leading up to this, I had rehearsed my thank you speech in my mind several times and it always wandered over to how much he had been instrumental in my recovery and it is on that foundation that the success I have had as a person was built. 

The 30 year chip victory lap doesn't seem so appropriate given his passing, so I will allow this to be my thanks to him. 

I'll miss you Bill D., Thank you for the gift of sobriety.",alcoholicsanonymous

"   I've been drinking regularly since before I even hit puberty and have had many high and low points in my life that are directly correlated to drinking.
   Ive always been able to go through stretches completely sober and dont really think anything of it up untill drugs and alcohol are the only things I can think about.
   So when that happens I always endulge. And like that ill be back to drinking. But when this happens its always 50/50 of how hard im going to go with it until my next sober period.
   Sometimes im able to to get buzzed or drunk everyday and know when to stop for the night, and other times it spirals out of control and im putting every drug I can find into my body on top of the alcohol and loosing days at a time without realizing it.
   But even during the worst of it when im forgetting entire days I always show up to work and maintain a steady job, and fulfill any obligations I may have had and continue up keep with my bills and household chores.
   Recently its been weighing heavy on my mind lately cuz I've came along way since my up bringing and dont want to loose everything I've worked for and end up some stereotypical bum on the streets. And I can feel the wear and tear ive put my body through all these years and don't want to continue on like this.
  I do want to learn to be better. I just dont know how to start. Any feed back would be appreciated",alcoholicsanonymous

I promised myself I won't drink anymore. I've been through so much shit drinking I don't know why I keep going back.

Part of me really wants to stop, it's ruining my life, but part of me doesn't. The only time I feel myself is when I'm tipsy after that first drink.

I don't know If I'm actually  addicted or if I'm just faking it for attention and to self define.

I decided to take the year off from college to work on AA and therapy, but being at home with my parents is mind bendingly boring.

"Was trying to go a week, made it 3 days. I guess that‚Äôs something right? 
I started the day on a high(compared to the usual dirt low feeling) note, left my house, got a coffee, and then I got stuck watching tv for hours. Took a nap, and woke up still feeling quite awful.

"I am 24 and have been drinking consistently since I turned 21.   Just before my 21st birthday I had a major break up and to cope with it I started drinking regularly.  Fast forward to present day and I regularly drink 2-3 liters of liquor per week.   I‚Äôve had many positive and sober movements, but I feel like I always come back to drinking.

I know that what I‚Äôm doing is self destructive and harmful, but frankly I don‚Äôt really care.   I‚Äôm not religious and I don‚Äôt really feel like life is worth living at most times.

"My gf of a year and 4 months is an alcoholic. I am sober and have been our whole relationship. She recently went to the hospital because she couldn‚Äôt stop vomiting  for over 24 hours. Doctors tell her she has pancreatitis from drinking as much as she does and she had about a 3 day stay at the hospital. So she has been sober for about 4 or 5 days.
I picked her up today and we went to a restaurant. We get done eating and I grab the little iPad thing to pay and she says ‚Äú wait, I want to just get one!‚Äù. I might have raised my voice a little bit because I was amazed. I said ‚Äú you literally just got out of the hospital for drinking and you want to go right back to it?‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt end up getting one and we left. 
On the way home she told me that I am not her support system. That if I really supported her I would have told her ‚Äú good job for only having one‚Äù. 
I may not know exactly how to deal with what‚Äôs going on and I know it‚Äôs always her choice and her life. I just really don‚Äôt understand how she expects me to support her drinking literally a half hour after she got out of the hospital for drinking? 
How can I show her that I love and support her when I don‚Äôt agree with the decisions she wants to make?",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been trying for 5 years or so to stay sober. I finally made it over a year and then recently relapsed. Some people in the rooms told me it wasn‚Äôt a relapse but I assessed my motives and prayed on it and believe it was. 
Regardless, now I am going to be taking a startover and I am full of shame and guilt. 
My girlfriend who has been sober 4 years is ready to leave me and I don‚Äôt blame her. 
I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm looking for but I could really use some strength today.

"I got fired from my job on my first day, I didn‚Äôt even make it ten minutes in. The job required a lot of talking to people so I drank so it would calm my nerves and make me more talkative. It was a position where I‚Äôd be taking care of elders, and I feel terrible about showing up drunk to the job but I never drank enough that it affected/effected (I don‚Äôt know which is which still) my work previously but I did over do it. Didn‚Äôt even make it ten minutes into my job, they asked me to take a drug test. They drove my allllll the way there and I started tearing up like a little weakling once we arrived, I started texting my dad what I should do. I lied to him, I said I drank the night prior. I had drank a little over a bottle of wine an hour or so before my job and didn‚Äôt know what they were testing for but I refused. I stole loads of my parents alcohol, I‚Äôm paying them back. I lied to all my friends about what happened, although I did tell them it was because of alcohol. The majority of the time I‚Äôve spent with them for the past two years I‚Äôve been drunk (I almost never carried alcohol on me, just a couple times, so it was just during the beginning to give me a little boost of energy). I gave it up four days ago, but I feel like a terrible person. Especially that I‚Äôm lying to everyone, I‚Äôll tell them in the future I‚Äôm just not comfortable telling everyone right now. I also wanted to ask if it‚Äôs normal to hate your personality, the way you carry yourself after giving up drinking. I‚Äôm trying to be just as talkative as I was but I hate how I feel. I used to go almost everywhere drunk. But I‚Äôm trying not to seclude myself in a little bubble, although that‚Äôs what I want to do. After everything I say I just squint my eyes and think why why did you say that?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi! 
I (23F) have known for a long time I have had a drinking problem and have always justified it as ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúit is not as bad as that guys‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs not every night‚Äù. It isn‚Äôt every night.. but it is every other/multiple times a week. 

Addiction runs in my family and was always told to ‚Äòbe careful‚Äô with drugs and alcohol because I am statistically more likely to get hooked. These comments were typically followed by an eye roll. Plot twist, I got hooked. 

I am so ready to be done, and have tried multiple times in the past on my own. I am finally ready to start attending meetings and really putting in the work. I want my friends and family to be there to support me but I‚Äôm SO ashamed of myself to admit that I have a problem. I also don‚Äôt want them worrying about me every time someone at the table orders a drink, or if we go to a concert. 

It‚Äôs silly that I am ashamed to want to be better, and I know that but I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell them I want and need their help. I have a loving and fantastic support system and no I will be met with love (and lots of worry)!

"22 years ago, on October 13th, I walked back into the rooms where I had previously picked up a 2 yr chip and announced myself as a newcomer. Life had gotten hard and I wanted to die. I knew what would make that feeling go away -- a drink. The compulsion came back in a hurry. Half a beer later, and I wanted to quit my job, move to NYC, get whatever work I could, and drink myself to death.

Fortunately, that was just one night and when I sobered up, I realized that I needed to get honest with myself and with this program. See, I'm one of those people that doesn't ever want to be ""the class fuckup"". I was like, if I'm going to be an alcoholic, I'm going to be the best damn alcoholic in AA. I got a sponsor. I did 30 in 30. I worked the steps. I took all kinds of service positions. But, I wasn't being honest with myself and when life got hard, as it does, I picked up a drink.

The second time around, I got a new sponsor. I made a searching and fearless moral inventory. I stopped trying to be a ""good alcoholic"" and got honest with myself and those around me. Part of that was 30 days of raising my hand as a newcomer and then picking up a 30 day chip. That was 22 years ago today.

Since then, both my parents have died. I got married, divorced, and married again. I got laid off, quit jobs, got promoted, got told I ""wasn't meeting expectations"", moved, etc... Life happens, but thank god, I haven't had to pick up a drink to deal with it. I'm so grateful I was able to make my way back to the rooms and that people were there to welcome me. Thanks y'all for being here.",alcoholicsanonymous

"UNREMITTING INVENTORIES

Continue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear.  When these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them.  We discuss them with someone immediately and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone.  Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The immediate admission of wrong thoughts or actions is a tough task for most human beings, but for recovering alcoholics like me it is difficult because of my propensity toward ego, fear and pride.  The freedom the A.A. program offers me becomes more abundant when, through unremitting inventories of myself, I admit, acknowledge and accept responsibility for my wrong-doing.  It is possible then for me to grow into a deeper and better understanding of humility.  My willingness to admit when the fault is mine facilitates the progression of my growth and helps me to become more understanding and helpful to others.

"How would you approach step 8 if you were diagnosed with a mental illness that impacted decision making, such as bipolar disorder? When I reflect back on all persons I‚Äôve harmed, it‚Äôs tough for me to disentangle what was driving my behavior, my addiction or mental illness. Now that I am properly medicated it‚Äôs pretty clear it was the bipolar that was causing me to hurt others unfortunately. I‚Äôd love to do right with all those I‚Äôve harmed, but part of my treatment for my bipolar disorder is not ruminating on the past as it can send me towards a manic state.

A guy from HS I haven't spoken with or seen in 30 years relayed the details.  There were AA people at the party and I was considering how to lie to not lose 18 years of sobriety.  It took me a few minutes after waking up to realize it was just a dream.

"Cross posed this is another community a few days ago, but want to get some more perspectives from maybe some different people‚Ä¶

I recently found out a friend has been going to a bar 2-4 times a week.  I know that alone this may or may not seem to be significant, but how they are going about this is what is concerning and making me think that they‚Äôve developed a problem.  Or at least are heavily relying on alcohol as a crutch for their problems.  

To start, they lie about what they are doing.  They say they are going out with other friends or spending time with their family, but the only thing they have planned is to end up drinking at their bar of choice.  Note - they found out we knew this was going on so they started going to a different bar.

When they do this they are 100% alone.  They meet no one, but occasionally bring someone they‚Äôve met home for a hookup.  They literally sit at the bar, order drink after drink, scroll their phone, and then drive home.  

They often leave their house late in the evening (9-10PM) and don‚Äôt return home from the bar until after 1AM most nights, unfortunately driving themselves home.  And they have to be at work by 9AM most days. 

They hide what they are doing very well.  Or at least they try.  They are a well established adult in their 30s who is intelligent, has a good but high stress job, and are a very calm person so most people would not know they have a problem.  I know that alcoholism does not discriminate though.

Being honest, I have 0% experience dealing with alcoholism.  I‚Äôm guessing most people will not say that any of this is normal?  Does anyone have a similar experience they can share and how they handled it?

I‚Äôm not sure what to say or even do.  I want to be a helpful friend but not cross any lines.  I guess my question is how can I let them know they have a problem, encourage them to get help, and that I‚Äôm intervening because I care?",alcoholicsanonymous

"CURBING RASHNESS

When we speak or act hastily or rashly, the ability to be fair-minded and tolerant evaporates on the spot.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 91

Being fair-minded and tolerant is a goal toward which I must work daily.  I ask God, as I understand Him, to help me to be loving and tolerant to my loved ones, and to those with whom I am in close contact.  I ask for guidance to curb my speech when I am agitated, and I take a moment to reflect on the emotional upheaval my words may cause, not only to someone else, but also to myself.  Prayer, meditation and inventories are the key to sound thinking and positive action for me.

"I feel ashamed for who I've become. I loved weed, smoked it daily, but then alcohol came into the equation making the highs, higher and more enjoyable. I despise the hangovers like any rational human would, even going through my bouts of 'hangxiety'. I suffer from OCD and anxiety, so I felt like alcohol would silence my ever-racing mind. Now it's a problem, it's something I hate. I openly disgrace alcohol during hangovers, but find myself crawling back to the bottle whenever I feel as if I've fully, physically recovered. You never recover fully, obviously. But well off enough that I would binge drink 6-12 beers to myself, locked away in my room, only to pass out and wake up with killer nausea and diarrhea, dizziness, brain fog, and anxiety; all compiled together with a lack of sleep and having to go to work shortly after. I hate it, I hate the feeling of being attached to this poison. Before considering AA meetings in-person or online, I thought about asking people here what their experiences were. How do I quit? I've only been binge drinking like this for a few months, but I clearly see how harmful it is and how stupid it makes me. Please, any advice is greatly appreciated.",alcoholicsanonymous

- read the just for today and try and meditate on it 
- set my daily positive intentions (can relate to the just for today) and try and schedule my day to minimize potential stress
- journal once a day to take inventory and accountability 
- attend a meeting (in person or via zoom) 
- stay hydrated 
- tell myself out loud or in writing that I‚Äôm going to get through the day without relying on unhealthy coping skills (and that I am strong enough to experience whatever discomfort is making me want to rely on them.) 
- pray (in my case, do some sort of mindfulness exercise.)

"On Saturday at my home group an old timer with 33 years who I very much admire brought up an issue. He vocalized that he thought our group should rethink closing the meeting with the Lords Prayer. He said that it‚Äôs a Christian prayer and has the potential to alienate new comers who might not share that particular faith. I, as a non Christian agree with him 100% although I did not vocalize it at the time. I never recite the Lords Prayer even though my home group closes with it every week. It‚Äôs a Catholic prayer and I personally find the Catholic Church to be a corrupt and questionable institution. I wouldn‚Äôt  never try and steer someone away from their faith as I believe it is a deeply personal choice. But I agree that AA prayers should be non denominational. The old timer who brought this up was very polite and provided examples of alternatives that are in the big book. The next day I attended another meeting and over heard a group of men saying some pretty vicious things about this guy for merely making a suggestion. A suggestion I quite frankly agree with completely. The guys talking shit are also old timers with lots of sober time under their belts. Guys who I previously looked up too in a lot of ways. I‚Äôm torn between feeling like this shouldn‚Äôt be such a big deal to me and wanting to speak up about it. I have and always will refuse to recite a Catholic or Christian prayer. I‚Äôm fairly certain if I tried to close a meeting with an Islamic or Hindu verse there would be fits thrown. I know this should probably be something I just shrug off but I‚Äôve done a lot of metal gymnastics already as an atheist in AA.

"My husband is an alcoholic and has been for years. He is a horrible drinker in the sense of you only get coherent him for an hour max, and then all down hill until he passes out. He‚Äôs always been this way and it‚Äôs always been irritating to drink around him and embarrassing to drink with him around our friends and family. He is not an angry drunk, or mean or anything like that. He‚Äôs just the worst version of himself. He says stupid things that he never would sober, he is outrageously flirty and overly nice in a really uncomfortable way, and his body just gives up on him to the point of his running into walls or his legs giving out when he stands and he drops everything! He‚Äôs just a dumb drunk. Anyways, we‚Äôve recognized this as an issue throughout our years together and he‚Äôs tried to be sober at least 4 times. We are on the fifth time now, maybe. It is very frustrating for me, because I, of course, want him to get sober, but I am struggling with understanding how he can‚Äôt just drink without blacking out every time. I get that a few drinks in and all sense is out the window and that‚Äôs why, but it‚Äôs so difficult for me to put myself in his shoes and I feel so guilty about it. I am a very easy drinker. I love a few glasses a few nights a week, but I‚Äôm extremely functioning and can drink for hours without being even remotely close to his level. Of course I‚Äôve had my nights where I have gone too far, but it‚Äôs usually a result of something going on and I went into the situation intended to get more wild than usual. I am being sober along side him to be as supportive as I can be, as I always have been. However, I feel like I am being punished for an issue that I don‚Äôt have.

"So I'm 6 months sober now. I've honestly not had any cravings for alcohol since I made my decision because I truly believe that the next glass contains my life. I have stronger cravings for sugar than I ever had for alcohol since I've stopped drinking. Saying no to a Coke is way harder than saying no to a beer.

I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this. And it doesn't have to me a shift to sugar. What other cravings have you experienced since you quit drinking?",alcoholicsanonymous
"Today is my AA birthday.  There was I time when I would not have believed I would get this far.  I tried to quit drinking on my own.  I got ‚Äúforced‚Äù into AA in my early 20s, but it took another 10 months of worsening pain and misery for me to finally get sober for good.  

Staying sober the first couple of years is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done.  It took lots of meetings, sometimes 3 a day, a good sponsor, and working the steps.  I also had to cut things out of my life that made me want to drink.  

I am not a an ideal example of how to work the program.  Sometimes I‚Äôve been an example of what not to do.  I‚Äôm glad the program allows for imperfection, as long as we are honest and rigorous.

These days, not drinking is my habit.  Cravings, once always present, are almost nonexistent now, and if they do arise, are easy to dismiss.  However, I never want to let my guard down or forget where I came from.  It was a horrible place, and I never want to return.

I say all this to let you know that if you embrace the program with honesty and a willingness to work, not only is sobriety possible, it can get easier the longer you stick with the program.

My drive to work provides me with an opportunity for self-examination.  One day while making this trip, I began to review my progress in sobriety, and was not happy with what I saw.  I hoped that, as the work day progressed, I would forget these troublesome thoughts, but as one disappointment after another kept coming, my discontent only increased, and the pressures within me kept mounting.  I retreated to an isolated table in the lounge, and asked myself how I could make the most of the rest of the day.  In the past, when things went wrong, I instinctively wanted to fight back.  But during the short time I had been trying to live the A.A. program I had learned to step back and take a look at myself.  I recognized that, although I was not the person I wanted to be, I had learned to not react in my old ways.  Those old patterns of behavior only brought sorrow and hurt, to me and to others.  I returned to my work station, determined to make the day a productive one, thanking God for the chance to make progress that day.

"I got my reddit cake day reminder last night. 2 years ago I drunkenly created this user name and reached out here for help. I was told to go to meetings, get a sponsor, work the steps, help others, get involved, among other things.

Since coming back to AA God has done marvelous things in my life. If you don't believe in God we can call it ""Me getting out of the way"". My life is full. I am a loving man. I am useful. If your life is dark and you feel hopeless I plead that you really give AA a shot. Not just an AA sub on reddit, or checking out some zoom meetings- get involved. Get a sponsor, set out chairs, help clean up, give people rides to the meeting, call people, chair meetings, get a home group, get plugged in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I alone am not responsible for these changes....my own experience proved that time and time again. This part of the book is one of the first things I read with my sponsor. He told me I had to stop with the belligerence (fighting to stay sick ""yeah, buts...) and demonstrate some willingness (I was taught that willingness is action. I wanted A LOT of things in my life, but what actions did I actually take to get them?)

&amp;#x200B;

My actual sobriety date is Oct 13. I went to a friends wedding on Oct12 knowing full well I was going to drink. But I also knew the end was near. I was circling the drain. I was beaten down. It was the most miserable night of drinking. I drank not because I wanted to, but because I HAD to. There was no choice. I drank full well knowing that I was done, it was a very strange feeling. The next day I went to a meeting and that's when things began to change. Oh how dark it is before the dawn indeed!

**From The Spiritual Experience:**

**Most of us think this awareness of a Power greater than ourselves is the essence of spiritual experience. Our more religious members call it ""God-consciousness.""**

**Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual principles. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.**

**We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program. WILLINGNESS, HONESTY AND OPEN MINDEDNESS ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF RECOVERY. BUT THESE ARE INDISPENSABLE.**

**""There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance--that principle is contempt prior to investigation."" --HERBERT SPENCER**",alcoholicsanonymous
"I have been drinking heavily lately. I‚Äôm a 23 male looking for advice to stop this cancer-like habit. I‚Äôm realizing more and more that I can‚Äôt really give up this habit without help. My parents have went on a trip and not having them here has lead me to feel more less restricted on the drinking. 

I ask what advice if there is any that I don‚Äôt already know. To stop this habit.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Title pretty much says it all. I abused psychedelics as a late teen early 20s person. It got bad. I definitely have an addictive element to me. But I also have general life long depression and anxiety and probably some kind of OCD‚Ä¶i do have issues.  

Was I happier when I was 24 in early sobriety living a carefree life in a halfway house surrounded by insane people, constantly socializing? While still half way high from drug use? Sure. That was a like 2006. 

I‚Äôm an adult now. All my friends have gotten married, I‚Äôm pretty darn isolated, 2020 was very hard on me as I got laid off early pandemic from a real career and didn‚Äôt get a real job for about 9 months. I relocated back to my parents and sister‚Äôs family area. I have no friends here. 

I thought 2021 would be a big comeback year. Turns out my new job of pretty toxic. I got mono and was really sick from July 3rd through just recently. I‚Äôm still freaked out by covid especially after being sick for months and my closest coworker is a covid long hauler and suffering every day. 

And returning ‚Äòhome‚Äô as I push 40 years old, single, isolated, I‚Äôve been taking to and seeing my parents a lot. Our relationship has degraded, at times, to points that are very similar to my rough teenage years. Which I totally did not expect. 

They clearly have PTSD from what I put them through. Just being around me so much more and also seeing my increasingly unhappy (sick for months, can‚Äôt eat hardly anything, unhappy with work, feel lost) - they are super triggered. They seem to think I‚Äôm going to go full alcoholic rapidly or just kill myself or something. This is very much them dredging up feelings from 2005. 

But it‚Äôs very confusing to me. I am drinking and smoking pot less now than pretty much any point since I got un sober 10 years ago. My depression level is not crisis level. They just aren‚Äôt used to dealing with me regularly and I‚Äôm over sharing. 

But they have worked themselves into a nearly panicked state about me and are essentially insisting that I go back to AA if nothing else but for the fellowship. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm very Dry and worse than I realize and they are right, or if this is much more complicated. But if I ignore them I may really damage the relationships so I pretty much have to go to some meetings to try. 

I speak to with a therapist 2x a week and a psychiatrist about quarterly. They see me as not ideal but ok and I just need to do more positive stuff with my life. Though I‚Äôm not doing that. I am in a emotional and behavior rut, poor emotional sobriety, but have also just had a really difficult 2 years and lately few months. 

I don‚Äôt really think I am an alcoholic but certainty am kind of on the line there. But not actively abusing. And while making friends in AA does sound like it could be a huge help for me, it does not really feel appropriate with that at the top of my agenda, aside from appeasing my parents and sister who have decided this is the solution. 

Thoughts?",alcoholicsanonymous
"I think I want to attend a meeting sometime soon. I am not ready to stop drinking, but I think I want to stop. I don't enjoy being drunk, but for me it's less worse than being sober. I feel like I would prefer to just not exist at all, but I really can't tell for sure what I want.

What's the best way to approach a first time meeting?",alcoholicsanonymous
"So I tested positive for COVID on Friday, and I feel absolutely terrible. The problem is, it feels exactly like alcohol withdrawals. The sleepless nights, the shivering, cold sweats, anxiety. It‚Äôs brought me right back to when I was drinking and I feel so depressed about it. I‚Äôm 13 months sober, working the steps with my sponsor, I just wanted to share this to get it off my chest. If anyone can relate? I‚Äôd be grateful for some words of support. I know I‚Äôm sober, but it‚Äôs like my memory is deceiving me and making me feel like I‚Äôm drinking again.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I feel so terrible!
After 33 days not drinking I‚Äôve decided to have ‚Äúa drink‚Äù with my friends to prove to myself that it‚Äôs okay to have an occasional drink.

"I‚Äôm still hoping to find balance and be an ‚Äúin moderation‚Äù wine drinker. But I‚Äôm becoming more open to the idea that I may be delusional. I‚Äôve been trying to cut down on drinking or stop since I was 23. 

I make monthly goals of how many days I want to have 0 and less than 3 drinks. This month I set a goal of 20 days of 0 drinks and only allowing myself 3 binges. Problem is it‚Äôs only the tenth and I‚Äôve already binged twice. :/

"I am newly sober currently in treatment. I went to a bunch of different meetings and loved all of them and met a woman at one who invited me to another of her regular meetings. So I went with her but did not like the meeting. It seemed more like a pickup scene to me with everyone very done up and dressed up and what seemed like flirting. I also felt like people were checking me out like people check each other out at a bar or club or party whereas the other meetings I had gone to were very much come-as-you-are, low key, and zero pick-up vibes whatsoever. So that‚Äôs my first IS THIS NORMAL question. Was I just in less polished (I don‚Äôt know exactly what word to use) kinds of meetings at first or something?

Anyways, someone at the pick-up scene meeting Who knew me very casually saw me and is friends with the woman who invited me there. the pick-up meeting (as I think of it now) is her Home group. I didn‚Äôt recognize her because she was dressed up and wearing makeup and had her hair done and I‚Äôd never seen her like that before. she invited me to another meeting she goes to so I went with her. 

On the car ride to that meeting she was kind of combative and confrontational about aa and sobriety in general in a way that felt rude and insensitive to me. I‚Äôve been through hell the last few weeks with so many different things and am feeling very beat up already. Her interactions with me left me feeling discouraged and attacked. At the meeting she got upset with another woman and said something pretty sarcastic to her and it made me really uncomfortable. But I still went out to fellowship afterwards with her and enjoyed it except for a few more sarcastic comments that were quite off putting. But I actually found a woman to be my temp sponsor there. That‚Äôs my second IS THIS NORMAL for aa question. Are some people just more aggressive about aa and sobriety because they know how serious it is to stay sober? 

Fast forward to today and I asked the first woman I met if she was going to the meeting this week that I met her at originally because I‚Äôm planning on going. She said yes and that I should go to fellowship beforehand and I politely declined as I have been running a million miles an hour ever since I got sober almost 3 weeks ago and my treatment counselor has advised me to SLOW DOWN because ‚Äúrecovery isn‚Äôt running around like a chicken with your head cut off.‚Äù I literally have 3 hours of time before this meeting where I will have to opportunity to sit alone in silence with myself, meditate, rest and chill the fuck out. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve done that. She responded telling me I have to go to fellowship because it‚Äôs so important in early recovery and asked if It was a money issue? I agree with her on the importance of fellowship and tried to explain how I have not had time to slow down and needed to do that before this meeting and had gone to fellowship after a meeting with the woman we both know and loved it and actually found a sponsor there. She responded with a very short ‚Äúsee you at the meeting‚Äù. Wtf? That‚Äôs my third  IS THIS NORMAL for aa people question. Now I don‚Äôt even want to go to the meeting because I‚Äôm afraid she going to try to make me feel bad for not going to the fellowship. 

These two off putting women have been sober for many years so I want to respect them but outside of AA I would nope the hell away from these kinds of people and situations. But I‚Äôm also questioning myself in how I‚Äôm thinking and feeling about it. Help me try to put this in perspective more.",alcoholicsanonymous

I am part of a hybrid meeting that does a H.O.W. Format. I‚Äôd really like to learn more about that meeting too. From what I‚Äôve gathered its about honesty,openness, and willingness.

"Hey guys,
I am four days sober and just attended my first AA meeting two days ago. It was an outdoor meeting on the beach that said it was for newcomers. The location was moved from where it said it was online, so I ended up being like 10 minutes late so I just sat down quietly in the back. About half of the people were ripping vapes the whole meeting and the girl leading it proceeded to belligerently call out everyone who came in late (about 5 people showed up after me saying they also got lost due to the location change). Then she started calling on random people who didnt want to share as it seemed it was their first time trying to force them to talk. She called on my boyfriend who came with me for support and was badgering him to share. He was honest, and said, ‚Äúat the beginning of the meeting you said not to share if I‚Äôm under the influence of mind altering drugs, I smoked weed right before I came here so I don‚Äôt think I should.‚Äù she said, ‚Äúno share‚Äù and made him. he was too sweet to say he was there for me, so talked when he was really uncomfortable. then there was a guy in recovery from heroine who shared who kept saying the exact location, about 3 times, of where he used to score - ‚Äúthe hotel at the intersection of blank and blank.‚Äù is this what a meeting is typically like?

What a freedom I felt when this passage was pointed out to me!  Suddenly I saw that I could do something about my anger, I could fix me, instead of trying to fix them.  I believe that there are no exceptions to the axiom.  When I am angry, my anger is always self-centered.  I must keep reminding myself that I am human, that I am doing the best I can, even when that best is sometimes poor.  So I ask God to remove my anger and truly set me free.

I guess I know what the problem is? And don't want to make people feel sorry for me. Or help me. Or talk to me? I don't even know. I am in it deep. Still haven't had a drink or a drug.

I dont exactly have cravings, but I also feel like I quit too young, still so much to do in life, but...fuck idek how to explain it. I hit my bottom and know I couldnt emotionally handle going lower than I did, I feel like tempting fate at times. At a meeting this one dude said he hoped for shitty things to happen to him so he could justify drinking and that resignated with me. My life has been going so well recently I just wish some shit would go down, even though I cant even think of what would need to happen to make me drink again. Im lost I guess. Im lost and I dont really know which way to head.",alcoholicsanonymous
"My trifecta is beer/liquor, cigarettes and pot i cant have one without the other two and its caused me immense financial turmoil over the last 5 years, I stumbled into some money last year and it only exasperated my vices. Now that the money has dwindled away and the bills due im finding it extremely difficult to quit mentally, I can be sleeping but I know if I dont go to the liquor store before it closes I'll be in for a night of racing thoughts until it opens, 3 years ago I was heavily abusing Xanax and vodka and then I told myself just beer and now I honestly have to drink about 5L of beer or 10 tallboys to even feel a thing and then I wakeup and do it again, pretty sad tbh.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Day 2 after three straight years of consistent alcohol abuse and I‚Äôve been drinking everyday for the last 1-2 years. The fact that I am 21 makes me feel like what i‚Äôm doing is okay. I see all of my peers around me drinking, why can‚Äôt I? Well because I don‚Äôt know when to stop and I drink a liter of vodka a day. All i‚Äôm craving right now is a liter of vodka to down tonight but i‚Äôm pushing through it (barely). I always try to stay sober but haven‚Äôt been able to make it to two weeks in years. I just want my passions back, I want myself back. I choose drinking over anything else in my life. I have gained probably 20-30 pounds just from my drinking. Eating healthy and going to the gym is literally my only way out right now. The feeling after a workout and knowing that i‚Äôm sober and making progress in my body, mentality, and health is OVERWHELMING and gives me so much dopamine, almost more than alcohol does and it‚Äôs absolutely the best. It‚Äôs either I am a productive, healthy, motivated human being, or i‚Äôm an alcoholic. I‚Äôve tried to find a balance but it‚Äôs impossible for me. I HAVE 0 SELF CONTROL. Once I start it just turns into benders. No one else around me really understands how bad it is. Both of my parents are alcoholics so it definitely runs in the family. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt drink at all so that definitely helps but he also doesn‚Äôt understand how I feel.. he‚Äôs tried to help me multiple times but after seeing me always give up and give into temptation, he has finally stopped and told me I have to do this on my own. I would drink throughout my work day until I fell asleep at night because for some reason the way alcohol makes me feel is better than anything else can, except working out. It‚Äôs like I have to be addicted to something and fitness would be my only other addiction. Alcohol has also made me a very aggressive person, attempting to ruin my relationship now and already has ruined one in the past and has also led to me being fired from a job. I know to some people it may seem easy to stay off because of how much bad alcohol does bad for me in the long run and because i‚Äôm so in love with working out and eating clean, but i can‚Äôt stop myself. I drink to blackout, to where I won‚Äôt remember a single thing, to not remember falling asleep, and it‚Äôs embarrassing. i want it all to stop, i want to get back into what i loved. I think I now drink because obviously I am obsessed with the feeling, but also because i‚Äôm insecure. I won‚Äôt be insecure if i stop drinking and focus on my body and mentality but it‚Äôs just a constant cycle. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I do know what I‚Äôm going to do about it, I‚Äôll get a new job (they were going to have me take a urine sample I refused and got fired) and stop drinking cause thankfully I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm at the point where I can‚Äôt stop. My mom found out about how much I drank today, she‚Äôs extremely distraught by it. I don‚Äôt know what to say to her, I‚Äôll stop drinking but alcoholism runs in the blood like. Her father was an alcoholic, so was my dads brother and father. I don‚Äôt know what to say to her, I don‚Äôt feel like a sorry is good enough. I feel bad for making her feel this way and she told me some stuff that happened to her when she was younger because of ‚Äúalcohol‚Äù which is untrue (not the story but that it was because of alcohol) and I found out my grandpas a complete piece of shit. I didn‚Äôt say or do anything because I didn‚Äôt know what to say my dad was mouth lipping the words ‚Äúsay something‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt know what to say.  I should‚Äôve said something but with past experience I just feel like she would‚Äôve got more upset. I still didn‚Äôt come completely clean about it to them, I said I drank with friends and would share with them but I drink by myself. Not anymore though, I‚Äôve thought about quitting in the past but since I was functioning I figured the only thing I‚Äôm messing up is my body.",alcoholicsanonymous

The past couple weekends have gotten a little dark. Last night I drank all day while my girlfriend was out with a friend. Ended up at the bar and passing out in my car.

I ended up throwing a glass at the floor and slitting my wrist 10 times with one of the shards. I am destroying my relationship. I‚Äôm destroying my life once again. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I went to meetings for awhile but I felt stupid because so many were in worse positions than me. I‚Äôm more of a binge drinker rather than a daily drinker. Part of me feels like I push myself to hit an all time low so that I have an excuse to ‚Äúgo get better‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúi just won‚Äôt drink anymore‚Äù but that never lasts very long. And once i do start drinking again it‚Äôs fine for awhile but eventually escalated into something like this.

"A SPIRITUAL AXIOM

It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 90

I never truly understood the Tenth Step's spiritual axiom until I had the following experience.  I was sitting in my bedroom, reading into the wee hours, when suddenly I heard my dogs barking in the back yard.  My neighbors frown on this kind of disturbance so, with mixed feelings of anger and shame, as well as fear of my neighbors' disapproval, I immediately called in my dogs.  Several weeks later the exact situation repeated itself but this time, because I was feeling more at peace with myself, I was able to accept the situation - dogs will bark - and I calmly called in the dogs.  Both incidents taught me that when a person experiences nearly identical events and reacts two different ways, then it is not the event which is of prime importance, but the person's spiritual condition.  Feelings come from inside,not from outward circumstances.  When my spiritual condition is positive, I react positively.

"Hello, 
 
So I just wanted to reach out tell my story &amp; offer my services. I do outreach free of charge &amp; help people get into treatment centers all across the US regardless of insurance. I‚Äôm just trying to share my story &amp; help people who many be active in addiction, on the fence about what to do with their lives or know someone struggling. You can message me anytime with questions, if you are seeking treatment, treatment for someone else or just want a friend to talk to. I do not charge any money at all. This is just my way of giving back &amp; being altruistic as that is the main thing I try to practice. I welcome anyone to reach out for My email or number. Before you read my story just know you do not need to have an ideal version of God or a higher power or even need to have a faith based program to be in sobriety. Below is my story that I hope will help even just one person.

My name is Alberto I‚Äôm a recovering, recovered  heroin addict or whatever terminology you want to use, it does not matter. I‚Äôve been sober since August 13th 2020 &amp; haven‚Äôt looked back since. I have had many years on &amp; off in sobriety but this time is when I finally was able to put it all behind me. A little about myself is, since the age of 14 I have struggled with heroin/fentanyl addiction &amp; many other forms of addiction. Heroin was the first substance I ever touched. For nearly 13 years on &amp; off I was heavily in the abyss of addiction &amp; done every single thing in my own way to overcome this disease. 

Of course not a single idea I thought of or plan I conjured up worked. I was a mad scientist trying to bend the rules of addiction to my will but failed each &amp; every time. It was only through acquiring a fellowship, spirituality &amp; finding the similarities that we as addicts/alcoholics share that helped me reach the moment that I know is what people described as when it comes to never wanting to use 
again.

I could talk about all the trauma &amp; pain I went through but none of that matters to me anymore, what matters is what I did with all of that pain. What I did was I was able to mold it with help &amp; was transformed from a victim into a survivor. By really understanding what surrender is, is only when my higher power &amp; others were able to truly help give me the gift of sobriety, but not just sobriety but a life I now cherish. 

Relapsing was more common to me than breathing, if a thought of using came into my head regardless of how much time I had you could bet your life I was going to use. The reason for that is because I never took the time to understand why I use. I would go to meetings, get a sponsor, go through the steps, pray to God &amp; even called people who I thought didn‚Äôt care about me but actually did. You never really understand what asking for help is like until you show people your true vulnerability. When I was able to open up to people &amp; God about my pain, trauma &amp; shame amongst the others things we all go through as alcoholics &amp; addicts, is when I was able to understand the difference between being helped &amp; asking for help. 

Being helped means you took the steps regardless of how uncomfortable or how vulnerable you end up. Each layer to my psyche was torn apart, each wall around my heart was broken down, each lie I told was brought to light. It was in these moments with people like yourself reading this that were able to help me understand why I use. I used to escape, I used out of insecurity, I used because I was an empty man with nothing to fill but substances that lasted as quick as they went into me, but with nothing to show for afterwards. After all the work, reaching out &amp; steps I took I was finally able to really feel spiritually fit for the first time. The empty hole in my heart was not filled but mended. It was mended by those regardless of what they went through, how they looked, age, sex or skin all understood the feelings I felt. Ever since I have never felt alone. I was always the kid to be reluctant to give it a shot, my ego was a monster that no man could tame, but God is not a man. 

No matter what you have been through people will always find a reason to help you, you just have to let them. Help is a nice word but the work that it entails is filled with trials &amp; sometimes torment that will bring you to your knees. The only thing that matters is you keep moving forward &amp; persevering. If you ever feel weak do not remember the pain you went through but remember the people who want to help you. Below are some pictures of a pale boy who was lost &amp; almost swallowed up by hell called addiction but now that boy became a man through the help of others who understood what he was going through. I am
Now a man who cherishes life, who yearns to be altruistic &amp; most importantly I smile not to mask emotions I don‚Äôt want you to see but because I am generally happy.

"I posted yesterday morning about going to my first meeting on Wednesday night. I received a lot of very thoughtful comments and suggestions and i want to thank everybody for that. I really appreciate it.

I went back at noon yesterday (just a couple hours after my first post) because i felt like i had a lot to unload and was almost frustrated that i didn‚Äôt the day before. I showed up, forced myself to get out of the car again, went inside and sat down. They asked if there were any newcomers which was obvious because there was 9 of us in there and the other 8 people all knew eachother, lol. But i raised my hand and and said yes, and proceeded to have my first step meeting. I explained what made me walk in there for the first time and of course balled my eyes out.

Everybody was extremely nice and helpful and i got a lot of phone numbers and information.

Today is three days since I last drank. I have been trying to get out of this hole that i dug for myself with school and work and as a result, my stress levels are very high.

I am now craving a drink more than i ever have in my life. Almost like the craving is manifesting itself physically in my body, for example I keep randomly getting up and pacing around without thinking about it and then realizing wtf I‚Äôm doing.

I know i should go to a meeting or talk to somebody, and i probably will, but i am not worried that I am going to have a drink. I just want to know how to deal with these intense cravings. I‚Äôve never had them like this before.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi everyone, 

As many of us know there has been a brief history of psychedelic substances involved in the early formative years of AA. 
Here is a quick explanation on the correspondence between Bill W and Carl Jung around the usage of psychedelic drugs and twelve step work. 

 ‚ÄúSome of my AA friends and I have taken the material (LSD) frequently and with much benefit,‚Äù Wilson told Jung, adding that the powerful psychedelic drug sparks ‚Äúa great broadening and deepening and heightening of consciousness.‚Äù 

Wilson told Jung that his first LSD trip in 1956 reminded him of a mystical revelation he had after hitting bottom in the 1930s and winding up in a New York City hospital ward for hardcore alcoholics. ‚ÄúMy original spontaneous spiritual experience of twenty-five years before was enacted with wonderful splendor and conviction,‚Äù he wrote. 

LSD was still legal in 1956, and in Wilson‚Äôs case initially taken under the medical supervision of UCLA researcher Sidney Cohen, and with the spiritual guidance of his Wilson‚Äôs friend, Gerald Heard, an Anglo-Irish mystic and early proponent of psychedelic spirituality. Wilson would go on to quietly form a bi-coastal psychedelic salon with various leading lights of that decade, including the writer Aldous Huxley.

Wilson‚Äôs earlier spiritual experience occurred in December of 1934, before LSD was even invented. It happened during Wilson‚Äôs fourth and final stay at a private New York City hospital that employed something called the Towns-Lambert Cure to treat their alcoholic clients. Many of these patients, including Wilson, were once-successful businessmen whose drinking had spun out of control during the Great Depression. 

‚ÄúSuddenly,‚Äù Bill would later recall, ‚Äúmy room blazed with an indescribably white light. I was seized with an ecstasy beyond description.‚Äù

That room was in a rehab center where doctors employed a potion which included two drugs derived from plants known to cause delirium and hallucinations. One of them is belladonna and the other henbane, was long associated with witchcraft and potions said to summon the spirits of the dead. (Warning to psychonaunts: both of these plants can be poisonous at high doses.) 


Apparently Carl Jung would come to pass before responding to Bills second letter. 


I would never share this in a meeting format but after 8 years of sobriety I developed a severe autoimmune disease and lost the ability to walk- after a few years of trying various mainstream medical treatments with no real progress I turned to alternative treatment methods. One of which was a shamanic ceremony where I ingested the psychedelic drug Iboga.  Afterwards my symptoms subsided nearly 70%. 
This past year I have been able to manage my chronic Lyme inflammation and mobility symptoms with continued micro-dosing of psychedelic drugs. I take micro amounts of psilocybin mushrooms and iboga root 5 days out of the week. 

It‚Äôs helped me tremendously in the realm of autoimmunity but I have largely kept my mouth shut about it in twelve step circles. 

At times I have wondered if I am putting my recovery at risk doing this. The truth is that I feel much better physically and mentally when using these medicines. 
My spiritual life and the conscious contact I have with my higher power feels stronger than ever. 
This sort of thing still automatically raises an alarm in my brain and I find myself thinking ‚ÄúI am using a chemical to control how I feel‚Äù
And this raises the natural suspicion if what I‚Äôm doing is healthy or not.  

I‚Äôm not so much interested in anyone‚Äôs personal theoretical opinions - but I‚Äôve wondered if anyone out there in 12 step internet land has any actual experience, strength, or hope around the subject. 

Thanks üôè",alcoholicsanonymous
"I‚Äôm early into sobriety again and I know statistically speaking, my chances for success increase if I go to meetings and work a program. 

I just can‚Äôt get over the cult/religious vibe I get there. Everything is so ritualistic and stiff and it seems like everyone‚Äôs high on the Bill W Kool-aid. I enjoy hearing people‚Äôs strength and hope and I buy into a lot of the philosophy and steps.

I just disagree with some aspects of the program. But it seems like any deviation from full indoctrination makes me a failure before I‚Äôve began as I‚Äôm trying to find ‚Äúan easier, softer way‚Äù and you‚Äôre considered non committal by members who‚Äôve been around longer and fully bought in.

I like being independent and autonomous and I can‚Äôt help but wonder how much personal growth I‚Äôm truly experiencing if I‚Äôm just shutting my mouth and nodding my head and living life in a way that‚Äôs laid out by something outside of myself.

Is there no gray area?

The sentiment that anyone who is sober but not following the program is secretly miserable and deluding themselves is a big red flag to me. But it‚Äôs a prevalent opinion when you walk through those doors.

Anyone whose made it another day sober has accomplished a great feat, whether they did it through there own willpower and determination, found support in family or friends, God or through AA.

I don‚Äôt think one way is easier or more right than another. But what do I know I‚Äôm early in recovery like I said. 

Let me know what y‚Äôall think or what I‚Äôm missing here. I‚Äôm willing to go to meetings but I just feel bad participating when I‚Äôm not genuinely 100% committed.",alcoholicsanonymous

... and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 59

I was beginning to approach my new life of sobriety with unaccustomed enthusiasm.  New friends were cropping up and some of my battered friendships had begun to be repaired.  Life was exciting, and I even began to enjoy my work, becoming so bold as to issue a report on the lack of proper care for some of our clients.  One day a co-worker informed me that my boss was really sore because a complaint, submitted over his head, had caused him much discomfort at the hands of his superiors.  I knew that my report had created the problem, and began to feel responsible for my boss's difficulty.  In discussing the affair, my co-worker tried to reassure me that an apology was not necessary, but I soon became convinced that I had to do something, regardless of how it might turn out.  When I approached my boss and owned up to my hand in his difficulties, he was surprised.  But unexpected things came out of our encounter, and my boss and I were able to agree to interact more directly and effectively in the future.

"I've been buying and drinking a pretty big bottle of blue raspberry vodka everyday for about 2 years now. After every day I finish it, I'm on the verge of dying after every night but I fall asleep without puking. Recently I've lost a lot of people in my life because of my uncontrollable drinking, however more recently I've been trying to quit. I ended up having a seizure because I went 5 days without alcohol and I experienced withdrawals for the first time.

"Hello, just wanted to share that I am clean and sober for 11 days so far.  I was never a heavy drinker in my younger years.  At 26 years old after a rough deployment to Iraq I came home and drank myself to sleep for 3 months straight.  Fast forward 15 years and alcohol has been a struggle ever since.

She still stayed with me for over a year. I was the nicest person in the world when I wasn‚Äôt drunk but when I was, I was horrible. Finally she had enough and left me and went to her brothers place this Sunday. I have been sober since then. I told her I will stop drinking and I will never fight with her ever again.

I'm not a very social person, I suffer from terrible anxiety to the point where I'm practically a shut in.  I'm in my early 40s, I've gotten buzzed on weekends for much of my adult life.  I never thought I had a problem, but looking back on it now, I can see it.

My mother was an alcoholic.  I believe that contributed to a lot of her health problems, but we never talked about things like that.  We were bottlers, suppressers.  As a result, I'm avoidant and anxious.  I don't form attachments with people easily, I like being alone.  During the pandemic, with children and husband home a lot, I was never alone and that made my drinking SO much worse.   It almost felt acceptable, you know?  Everyone joked about day drinking so it was easy to hide behind the memes and such.

Anywho... flash forward a bit and I've been sober now for 32 days.  I haven't attended a meeting (shy, anxious), I just wake up every morning and hope for the best.  So far it's been... not easy, but doable.  In recent days I've had some added stress and the temptation is returning.  I think that's why I'm here.  Maybe this will help, maybe in place of meetings I can just anonymously spew my thoughts and worries online and it will be cathartic. 

Anyway, thanks for this space.  I'm happy to be here.",alcoholicsanonymous

This is the longest Iv ever had sober 

I‚Äôm 19 years old and this is my 3rd try getting sober in the last year since rehab in March

This morning I still woke up feeling as if I‚Äôd drank all last night, mainly because of the headache, but it‚Äôs worn off.  I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôll be a reoccurring thing, or maybe it‚Äôs an underlying issue‚Ä¶.to be honest, I don‚Äôt know.  The only thing I do know, is I don‚Äôt ever want to put myself in a situation to have to go through the things I‚Äôve dealt with this past week. 

I‚Äôm making the decision daily to not drink. I still think about it a lot, and suppose I probably always will. But for today, I‚Äôm just going to enjoy not feeling run down, or overwhelmed. 

I firmly believe in God, and one verse that stuck out to me is 

Isaiah 5:11 (ESV)
‚ÄúWoe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening as wine inflames them!‚Äù

"
So I‚Äôm going in my first 74 days of sobriety, I love the aa program and have made some good friends. My first week I started going to aa I had a lady in her 70s come up to me and saw that I was a mess and she offered to be my sponsor. She came up to me and asked if I had one and I said no and she said oh well not anymore, I‚Äôm gonna be your sponsor. I thought it was a little strange because I thought we were suppose to ask people but I was grateful that she offered so I can get started on the steps. She was really good, she has 48 years of sobriety and I can tell she knows her stuff, she also has a lot of Sponses. So she gave me a packet to work on and started working the steps. As time went on she would make comments about how being a hair dresser isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal‚Äù career (I‚Äôve been a hair dresser for 10 years now) and gave me tons of shit about smoking a nicotine vape pen as I‚Äôm trying to quit smoking cigarettes. I kind blew it off because I know she‚Äôs an old timer and just wants what is best for me. But things just started to get worse, if I had to go to a clients hair at their house (I‚Äôm just doing it on the side right now because I want to be stable in my recovery before I get a real job) and if I couldn‚Äôt make a meeting because of it she said she didn‚Äôt want me missing meetings. I currently am going to 4 meetings minimum every week and whenever I miss one I make it up and I‚Äôm also in an intense outpatient program on top of that. 
I was suppose to meet at her house a few weeks ago and I was waiting outside her door for almost an hour as she wasn‚Äôt answering the door (I confirmed with her the day before) she ended up calling me a few hours later and said she was getting X-rays done at the doctor, I was a little irritated because she didn‚Äôt even let me know she was doing that and we confirmed the day before. 
Whenever I talk to her about personal stuff (I‚Äôve had 2 tragic deaths in my life recently and my best friend is currently out using drugs. Also there‚Äôs a lot of family drama in my life that I try to stay out of but I‚Äôm involved because it is my family) she just tells me it‚Äôs none of my business and just to let it go. She also says I need to get over people that died and stuff happens and she‚Äôs seen tons of people die and you can‚Äôt let it effect you. I understand where she‚Äôs coming from as a sponsor but those things are easier said and done. 
I recently went to an nfl football game on Sunday with my boyfriend and his dad. I normally go to a Sunday night meeting but my sponsor doesn‚Äôt attend that one. We got stuck in a ton of traffic on the way back from the game and we didn‚Äôt get home till late, on the way back she texted me and said she was going to be at that meeting and she‚Äôll see me there. I told her I was stuck in traffic and wouldn‚Äôt be going and I had no idea she was even going to go to that meeting. She ignored me and the next day she was upset with me because she said she went to the meeting just for me and didn‚Äôt show up. She also questioned why I would even go to a football game during Covid and to never do it again. I explained to her I am vaccinated and I actually had a good time and was proud of myself because it was the first event I‚Äôve gone to sober and didn‚Äôt drink. She just kept telling me to not go again. 
I also have been wanting to try an NA meeting that my friends from my out patient group goes too because they are all about my age, but I‚Äôm scared to tell her because she thinks alcoholics shouldn‚Äôt be going to an NA Meeting and visa versa. 
Long story short, I think I want to change sponsers but I don‚Äôt know how to go about it. I feel like if I talk to her about how I feel she‚Äôs just gonna get upset because she‚Äôs so set in her ways. She is a nice lady but I‚Äôm starting to get anxiety whenever I talk to her because I don‚Äôt want to say the wrong thing. I don‚Äôt want to have to change my home group because of this but but I‚Äôm horrible at confrontation. Any advice on how to go about this situation? 
Over all I love aa, I love the steps and the big book, I feel like it‚Äôs helping I just feel like My Sponsor isn‚Äôt right for me.  Sorry about the long post I appreciate anyone that has read this.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Another major problem I have with support groups is that when you speak and tell the others about your struggles and experiences, No one else is allowed to talk or give any feedback. I feel like there are people in the room who've  had similar issues and have constructive advice and suggestions but are forbidden from speaking. I find myself still struggling and wishing someone would provide answers, I get discouraged and end up quitting. What are your thoughts?

"I apologize for the length of this post.

I went to my first AA meeting last night. I‚Äôm 22 years old and was the youngest person there by a long shot. I was coming off of the worst bender of my life that lasted from last Thursday to this Wednesday morning when i laid on my couch in my apartment for 12 hours in a state of complete withdrawal.

I sat in the back for the whole hour and didn‚Äôt say a word. I really wanted to speak up but i was barely holding myself together and i knew that i would start balling my eyes out if i even tried to start talking. I know not sharing at meetings is okay, but i could tell that most of the people there could tell i was a newbie and wanted me to say something, but they weren‚Äôt about to make me uncomfortable or anything, which i appreciated.

I‚Äôve always been the person in my friend groups that gets the most fucked up, incoherent, and does some of the worst shit a person can do while fucked up. I‚Äôm embarrassed to say that i really can‚Äôt remember a single minute of Monday-Tuesday.. I‚Äôm a college student in my last semester and i didn‚Äôt go to class or work either of those days because for some reason i decided what was best for me was to keep the bender going and i just sat on my couch drinking a fifth of Jaeger.

I come from a long line of good people that are really bad alcoholics, on both sides of my family and i really feel like i have disappointed them tremendously.

This 4-5 day period in which i was fucked up almost nonstop wasn‚Äôt the first such occasion that I‚Äôve done that, but i do believe it was the worst and the longest and i don‚Äôt ever want to go through the hell of what i did Wednesday morning as well as the shame and embarrassment of my actions for myself and my family.

"Hey guys,

I‚Äôm 23 years old. I usually have 2 or 3 drinks before bed every night. This isn‚Äôt usually enough to make me hungover, but I have tend to drink pretty heavily on the weekends. I get terrible anxiety when I‚Äôm hungover. No headaches, just random panic attacks about absolutely nothing.

I drank heavily Wednesday through Sunday last week(which isn‚Äôt typical for me). Monday morning I had to pull over 3 separate times during a 45 minute drive due to my anxiety. I haven‚Äôt taken a sip of alcohol in 72 hours, but still had panic attacks frequently yesterday/today, and have only gotten about 8 hours of sleep total the past two nights, so I believe these are alcohol withdrawals.

I‚Äôve accepted that I need to slow down on my drinking and have proven to myself the past few days that I‚Äôm capable of doing it. My question to you guys is this: Let‚Äôs say the withdrawal symptoms are gone on Friday. If I drink on Saturday (not heavily of course), will the withdrawals come right back the next morning, or would I have a clean slate to work with?

Thanks everyone",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hey everyone,

When I was a teenager/young adult I had some pretty severe alcohol/drug abuse problems. I never wanted to label myself an addict, but I did eventually get sober after hitting rock bottom. Then I improved my life and got started on a career years later.

I still drank though. It took a lot of practice, but I switched to beer instead of liquor. And most of the time, I was too busy to drink. At most, I would go out binge drinking once a week while in college. And yes, I was disappointed in myself that I still had little self control when going out with friends.

Fast forward to today, I am fresh out of a divorce, have little connection to my family, and it's getting too late for me to ever have my own kids one day. I have a hard time imagining myself in another relationship because I always choose abusive men. So it's really not worth it. And now I have nothing to live for. 

I have been drinking everyday, getting shitfaced every weekend night. I love it when people cancel their plans on me so I can just drink in private instread.

But I had a stern talking too by my friend. Saying I need therapy, and I agreed I would go. But I kind of don't want to. I already know that I will go and they'll tell me to stop drinking. And I don't want to. What then?

"Hey all, I hit 5 years sober on 9/3/21, and I've been giving sponsorship some serious thought. I have a great relationship with my own sponsor (who has 17 years sober and has been sponsoring me from day 1), as well as his sponsor (my grand-sponsor?.. I think he has around 35 years sober). 

Anyway, I've been engaged in a voluntary 5-year recovery agreement with the Judges &amp; Lawyers Assistance Program with daily check-ins and random monthly urine screens for alcohol/drugs. My participation in the program is scheduled to end in December, and I've been thinking about ways that I can increase my accountability. When I no longer have to do random screens, I'm afraid I might hold myself less accountable than I've been doing, and I thought that replacing it with a sponsee might be a good decision.

I talked it over with my sponsor, who said ""it's about time!""... but I don't know the first thing about becoming a sponsor, other than what I've seen him do.

" Hello.

I'm an alcoholic who previously had been to a detox center. This has been probably 2-3 years now. Since then, I do okay. I don't know that I'm your typical AA alcoholic, as I managed to get into social drinking in the last year or two and seemed to be relatively okay. After getting out of the detox center, I stayed away for quite sometime, and then found myself occasionally going out and getting plastered. This would happen maybe once every month. Since then, I cleaned that up quite a bit, drink maybe 1-2 times a month (and not much at all). I also go to the gym and practice fitness and healthy eating.

I really thought I had it all turned around.

Last Thursday, I was in a wedding, and I drank with the wedding party and had maybe 6-7. Felt fine but hungover the next day. Friday, I drank at the wedding as well. I really screwed up - I'm certain I had over 16 drinks (spirits) to myself, which implies a 750ml bottle of liquor or more. I also woke up the next morning and drank 3 more, purely for the pain. I haven't drank since, so today is day 4 with no alcohol and no intention of continuing. I didn't eat at all Saturday and Sunday, and have been doing my best with water intake daily since but it's been averaging around 80oz. per day, and I'm 190lbs and usually drink around 120oz. of water. I started going back to the gym on Monday.

This is the second time this has happened this year, and the last time it did, it was only one night, I was hungover for at least 7 days. It is the same this time too, however in looking up symptoms like tingling arms, and just general flu-like symptoms I came across alcoholic neuropathy. Right now, I have a slight tingling in my arms and just some brain fog and some tremors. If I remember right, the only other time this happened this year, it went away after 5-7 days. I did not know about AN at that time, and I'm now afraid I've caused myself an issue and am worried that I should seek medical attention.

In regard to my habits, I had everyone convinced (including myself) that I was no longer a problem. So much for that huh? Luckily, since I got out of detox I have developed a habit of being able to not drink, so as long as I don't attend the wrong events, I won't drink by myself, or at home or anything like that. So moving forward from here won't be difficult, as I typically don't even have cravings or urges. I just wrongly convinced myself that I was able to handle something I'm not, and instead of manifesting itself in daily drinking, it all came out in a 48hr period.

Let me know what you think, I'm really nervous about this.",alcoholicsanonymous

I spoke to him, he promised it had never happened before and that he was in a bad place. I have now found out that this has happened at least three more times previously. 
I feel uncomfortable not saying anything to others, and feel like something should be done. Previously he had said he would tell others if I wanted him to but I said that‚Äôs up to my sponsee. Should I tell him he should now?

Just as a note to newcomers, this is not at all common in the rooms. The meetings are generally a safe space, please do not let this deter you. Thanks!",alcoholicsanonymous

"FACING OURSELVES

... and Fear says, 'You dare not look!'

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 49

How often I avoided a task in my drinking days just because it appeared so large!  Is it any wonder, even if I have been sober for some time, that I will act that same way when faced with what appears to be a monumental job, such as a searching and fearless moral inventory of myself?  What I discover after I have arrived at the other side - when my inventory is completed - is that the illusion was greater than the reality.  The fear of facing myself kept me at a standstill and, until I became willing to put pencil to paper, I was arresting my growth based on an intangible.

"Every since my 21st birthday I've picked up the habit of drinking, when I confessed to my therapist they simply said ""You don't need to add on anymore problems in your life."" which yes she's right, but it still hurt to hear. Been trying to nip it as early as possible but it's self medicating to me so I'm not sure what else to do honestly

"I have a question for more experienced people than I about how 12 Steps works, specifically 8/9 about making amends. 

My husband‚Äôs ex-wife is currently going through the steps, and claims that she has completed them and has become a sponsor. However, she never made any effort to make amends to our family, and when asked, she said she was making living amends because she didn‚Äôt have to make direct amends if it would hurt somebody, and it would hurt her. 

In all the research I did, it said direct amends are best unless it hurts the person you‚Äôre making amends to. It would not hurt us at all, she knows it, and we were looking forward to finally having an honest conversation with her. She definitely knows that amends are needed at the very least to the kids that she abandoned due to her addiction. 

Am I just completely misunderstanding what it means to make amends? I thought an apology is supposed to ‚Äúhurt‚Äù the person making it, that‚Äôs the entire point of admitting you did something wrong and you feel sorry for it.

"First a little bit on myself. I am 43 and would consider myself a functioning binge drinker since the age of 15.. My love for alcohol for me and my friends started in high school and continues to this day. I am not a daily drinker but a binge drinker every week from thurs to sat and then I am sober from sun to thurs.. This is process that has been on repeat for almost 30 yrs.. As I mentioned,  I consider myself functioning because 1) I have held a job since the day i left high school, moved up within the industry and continue to be successful, 2) feel I am a good father to the two children I have and 3) have a solid marriage w/ a wife that is my best friend .. I have always been a happy drunk but I am a blackout drunk..I mostly drink alone but I also rely on it heavily in social settings. I have dealt with anxiety for yrs which I always thought was relieved by my drinking however I understand that my vicious cycle is the culprit of the anxiety/depression.. About 1 yr ago I decided to sober up for a while just because (not call it quits, that was never the intention).. It lasted a surprising 75 days and then I celebrated with drinking.. I then adjusted my cycle to drinking once every 2 weeks foe a bit but it wasnt long before I was back to my usual 3 days on 4 days off binge (15 to 20 beers a night) cycle. This is what i became to know and love..Recovering Sum to Wed and back at it come Thurs (it cant come soon enough)

What I know is that 75 days was the best I  have ever felt in my life.. During that 75 days, I was exceeding expectations at work, being a more ""present"" father and husband to my wife and kids.. Anxiety and depression had vanished.. Looking back I should have kept going. 

I recently told my wife that I'm going to make another run at drying out with the goal in mind to beat my 75 days. Today is day 24 and I already feel so much anxiety relief and clarity. Even though I said I was going to dry up with a goal of &gt; 75 days, I since internally decided I am going for permanent sobriety. It doesn't make any sense to go back to my repetitive unhealthy lifestyle.. I feel I have a second chance at life to figure out who I really am and what I can be without the sauce in my life.

Since starting this life altering journey I have visited this sub daily and I find it helpful to keep on path.. Thank you all for listening. Wish me luck, one day at a time.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I‚Äôve tried AA multiple times. 

I‚Äôm in a cycle of drinking because of anxiety or because of messing up caused by drinking, so then I drink more and feel horrible all over again. 

I have tried therapy and for anxiety and depression and tbh alcohol just works better for me, or at least I feel more relief even if it is short lived. 

I‚Äôve lived my life messing up the personal part of it (no close friends) ‚Äî blacking out and saying things and having no idea why people hate me. Blacking out and doing embarrassing things. 

Today I am in trouble because of someone else‚Äôs excessive drinking and my failure to act professionally when I should have. Despite all of my drinking mistakes I have never gotten in trouble or messed anything up at work. 

My boss wants to talk to me tomorrow and I am terrified. I‚Äôve never been in trouble at work. It‚Äôs all I had going for me. I don‚Äôt know if I can handle it and it feels like the end of the world. 

I know I have a bad relationship with alcohol but it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs alcohol mistake I‚Äôm paying for now ‚Äî it makes me wonder if this would have happened if I had not had 2 beers myself. It makes me wonder if I need to stop or if I am managing/doing ok. 

I want to sleep but I can‚Äôt. I keep thinking of what a colossal failure I am and I‚Äôm embarrassed and horrified and I just really feel like I can‚Äôt face it. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like this is awful and I don‚Äôt know how to fix anything. Please help. Or give any advice you can.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I am a drunk. Years before now, I went to rehab. I told my therapists every disturbing thought and action I had ever done. I got sober, climbed some sort of corporate ladder, and made my parents proud. Years later I felt empty and isolated. I decided to go back to therapy. My therapist now is so normal and outgoing. I find I can‚Äôt talk to her like I did to my therapists in rehab. Where do people like me find treatment without going back to rehab or inpatient? I mask when I‚Äôm around well-adjusted people. But I‚Äôm not sick enough to want to go back to a place like that. Where do I go to find someone I can be my true self to? I just want to be free",alcoholicsanonymous
"
I had 2 DWI‚Äôs by the time I was 22. Rehab like 3x, court cases 2x, probation, the works. During most of that, not a bone in my body wanted to quit drinking beers.

From Early 2018-Summer 2020 I had 900ish days alcohol free, the last 250-400  or so of those days were drug fueled pure insanity. A girl I grew up with died in a terror attack in Sri Lanka, a few other neighborhood kids died, my best friend died of an overdose, then another girl from school, same thing a month or so later. 

I had already given up caring while not drinking, pre meditated relapse, textbook. At first I hit as many meetings as possible, was riding a pink cloud, it felt great. Then I pretty much figured I was better than anyone else who struggled with drinking, and nobody could school me. 

The end result was seas of rage and insanity honestly worse than any hangover or guilt related to drinking or really anything. It was the worst most uncomfortable irritating daily feeling I wouldn‚Äôt wish upon my worst enemy.

Throughout my drinking this year I feared more legal trouble, and tried several times to clean up to no avail. A week here and there, a month tops. More recently came within hairs of catching an assault after a blackout bar brawl I have 0 recollection of. 

I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúby the grace of god‚Äù ‚Äòcause the only certain thing I know about God is it‚Äôs just the word Dog spelled backwards. 
But by the grace of god, someone looked out for me and no charges were pressed.

I knew it was time to go back to AA. As much as it sucks balls throwing in the towel, admitting as a man I need help, and not being able to go party *the bars suck these days anyway, 0 females out on weekends (all at home watching tv due to covid)
I always just wanted some peace of mind. I knew deep down a lot of people who use AA to make it work for them have peace of mind, so I guess i‚Äôm just tired of running and ready to give myself to this shit.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi all! I‚Äôm a grateful alcoholic addict in recovery because of A.A. 

I‚Äôve been very blessed as of late to have started having regular meetings with other women in recovery through my work at a SAP program that previously did not offer AA. The question of whether or not to register the meetings has come up since they‚Äôve become something of regular programming. While I was reasonably active in A.A. Throughout my own recovery and continue to be, I‚Äôve never ventured into service work on a group level before, and thanks to COVID my home group no longer meets very regularly, so I‚Äôm sort of directionless with anything on the scale of organizing the formalities.

"Today I hit one year sober. I'm 20, part of me feels like it's pathetic that at 20 years old I'm already one year sober. That at so young I had a problem and had to choose sobriety if I wanted to survive. In September of 2020 I got black out drunk and fought cops, that was my rock bottom. I knew something had to change. From the second I turned 18 to that point at 19 I was essentially drunk every night. If I couldn't hide the night drinking I'd day drink and walk around. I functioned. I could function, but without the promise of alcohol I felt there was no reason to live. When I hit my rock bottom I met a paramedic who changed my life and perspective on things. He showed me there was more to life then getting shit faced. I had my last hoorah on October 5, 2020, of course it was day drinking. Well morning drinking. I got plastered on the steps of the courthouse. I'm missing most of that day, but I remember sobering up at McDonald's. At roughly 5:45pm I was sober. I promised myself when I started drinking that day to only have enough to enjoy. That's the last time I got drunk or even had a drop of alcohol. It's 6:30pm October 5, 2021 and I am proud to say I am 1 year sober. One whole year sober. I'll be honest I didn't think it was possible. It still scares me, what if I relapse after getting this far? What if I fail everyone? It's scary, but at least I can say is that in this moment I did it. Now I KNOW I can do it. I hope I don't slip, but it's one day at a time. Thank you for all of you who has supported me and helped me on days I've struggled. I hope everyone the best in their sobriety.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I stayed up all night drinking again. At 5am I finally searched for AA meetings near me. I‚Äôm super sporadic and chaotic when I‚Äôm drinking so I left the house even though it didn‚Äôt start for another 2 and a half hours. I hit the gas station and bought a tall boy. Turns out the meeting didn‚Äôt start until 9am. To kill time I went to my sister-in-law‚Äôs place and helped her take her son to school. Thank GOD she was awake. She actually ended up going to the meeting with me! When we got there it was exactly what I remembered from when I was 13 in rehab being forced to attend AA. A bunch of old geezers who all knew each other‚Ä¶ but this time I was there by choice and everyone was soooo kind and welcoming. Meeting one of the women was really special for me. In minutes of meeting each other she was hugging me and I just broke down in tears. I guess because I felt hopeful for once. I know the meetings alone do not keep you sober but for once I finally felt like I had the ability to let go of this chain on my life. Everyone at that meeting this morning read passages that stuck with both my sister in law and me. They didn‚Äôt urge us to think of recovery with God in a religious way and that‚Äôs great because we‚Äôre very spiritual in a different way. I was white faced, emotional, hadn‚Äôt slept in 24 hours, drunk as piss, head throbbing, and I look over at my sister and see her wiping tears and knew that we were both meant to be there today. I‚Äôm happy I made this choice, and when I came home my husband told me how proud he was of me. Here‚Äôs to about 6 hours sober!!! I hope there‚Äôs many more to come. What I‚Äôm telling myself right now is that even though I see literally everyone relapse at some point, I can‚Äôt use that as an excuse to drink again. Like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs okay I can drink tonight and start my journey again tomorrow‚Ä¶‚Äù because I really have that tendency to give myself any excuse to drink. Hell, I‚Äôll drink to not drinking! So stupid. So right now I‚Äôm working on deciding if I should cancel upcoming parties I‚Äôm hosting and events I‚Äôm going to because alcohol is everywhere in my life. I‚Äôm not sure if being around it right now is a good idea even though I‚Äôd like to think I could resist. I‚Äôve also been reminding myself that I hate who I am when I drink.

I have been searching opinions online and it seems that this is a common opinion out there from people that have been approached by those in recovery seeking to make amends to them.

"Hello everyone :)


I posted here a couple of days ago and everyone was extremely kind and generous with advice, thank you so much. I‚Äôm hoping for a couple of further tips please if anyone has any.


My mental health team who I have been under the care of for one year (major depression and suicide attempt) have referred me today to the substance abuse/alcoholism team. Apparently it will take about 2-3 weeks for them to get in touch. 


I asked about attending AA meetings but for now they have advised to try their professionals first. I have not ruled out AA and still very open to attending in future. For now, I am looking for some tips for how to get to at least one day of sobriety? In the past I had reasons not to drink (although that hasn‚Äôt always been enough to stop me) because the next day I needed to work, exercise class etc. But these days depression has wiped my motivation, I‚Äôm out of work, I basically lie in bed as much as possible which I am not proud of. Drinking is about the only thing I look forward to. I feel if I can crack one day of not drinking here and there, it will be easier for me to be productive on and off over the coming weeks.


I am supposed to be studying for the last year of my degree as a mature student which started on Saturday. But I haven‚Äôt even looked at it. It is flexible learning so I don‚Äôt have a fixed schedule unlike a traditional university. This is something that should be motivating me to get sober but isn‚Äôt.


Essentially, I am looking for tips as to how to beat the craving. Today I promised myself I would not drink, but once evening came around again, I did it. How to combat these cravings? I have heard of ‚Äúsurf the urge‚Äù but I always automatically dismiss it in my head. I was planning to distract myself tonight by watching a TV show but the temptation was too great.


TL;DR. Advice for cravings/urges please :)",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hello y'all, ill keep it short.

My roommate hit 1 year sober through AA about 2 months ago. He seems to have subbed seltzer water in for beers and it works for him from what I can see. I think it is worth noting that I sometimes have beer in the house and I made triply sure he was cool with it. (I have a deal with him to put a mini fridge in my room, or not to have any, if it truly became a problem, no questions asked. So far so good ~5 months)


He recently asked me if I was doing no booze October, which I am. He showed me a pic of some brewery that puts out a non alcoholic IPA and to see if our local place had it next time i went. I immediately got a sinking feeling in my stomach, imagining this is probably nothing but bad news. Although I have had some struggles with alcohol, I've never needed rehab or to permanently abstain. I can't imagine that if it came to that point, I would want to have near beers around me.


He's a grown man, so I don't want to impose on him by telling him to ask his sponsor first, I'm genuinely not sure how that works. So I'm asking you guys, should I pretend to have forgotten and hope he does too? Or should I get them for him? Thank you for your replies in advance.",alcoholicsanonymous

I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I can‚Äôt fall asleep unless I have satisfied the urge to get to that ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù state that I‚Äôm looking for. My sobriety didn‚Äôt last long at all and I feel like that adds to me just wanting to give in. Has anyone had this specific feeling before? Also, I hope everyone from a year ago is kicking ass!

"My husband is in rehab. First time - long time alcoholic. He went willingly. I expected his case manager to spend time talking to us about his departure from teh facility. I expected the facility to communicate with his psyciatrist and therapist (they work as a team). I have had to push HARD to get that communication to happen. My biggest concern being the facility wants to release my husband earlier than his therapist and psyhciatrist think they should. I understand this is my husbands decision but he says he is open to have the conversation with his Dr and the facility staff. I expected the facilty to communicate with the family about post release plans. About strategies if we suspect a relapse. I am meeting with active agression from his case manager as to what she sees as my ""questioning her credentials"". It's to the point where I realize there's no point in my talking to this person anymore. My husband isn't helpful becuase - while he agreed to talk to his therapist - he's obviously not eager to prolong his stay. I get that.  I just feel like the facility is going through the motions. But this is where I am. Any advice on opening the lines of communication with the facility? Though I suspect that's not going to happen. So more importantly any advice for supporting someone as they leave  inpatient treatment? I started al anon. He says he plans to go to AA meetings. I am really troubled by the differing opinions between his psychaitrist and the facilty and just the not knowing what's next. Thank you",alcoholicsanonymous

I have more than enough to handle today, without dragging along yesterday's baggage too.  I must balance today's books, if I am to have a chance tomorrow.  So I ask myself if I have erred and how I can avoid repeating that particular behavior.  Did I hurt anyone, did I help anyone, and why?  Some of today is bound to spill over into tomorrow, but most of it need not if I make an honest daily inventory.

I‚Äôm not sure I know how else to behave, I‚Äôm not sure he knows how else to behave. So therefore we were at a shitty stalemate. I‚Äôm a fixer and wanted to fix but I do know I can‚Äôt make someone change their internal emotional system. I have to change mine!

"I was once 6 months sober and relapsed. This time around in my recovery, I relapse after one month and then continuously every other two weeks. 

This time, I‚Äôve told my friends and family that I am in active recovery and I need their support to not offer me a drink. Ultimately it is my decision to drink, but to please not offer. They‚Äôre on board, which is great.

I am praying that this will eliminate the chronic relapsing. I‚Äôve noticed I never told anyone outside of AA and my boyfriend that I am a recovering alcoholic. I‚Äôd just avoid them as much as possible, but I can‚Äôt do that forever. 

I‚Äôve realized I was still relying on myself for my recovery. We cannot and will not recover on our own self-reliance. I have support from my fellow alcoholics in AA ‚Äî that‚Äôs easy. The outside of AA support is something I‚Äôve never done. It required me to be honest with myself and to the people I love and fear that I will lose respect from. Ive humbled myself. I pray to my HP that this is my ‚Äúrelapse-reason‚Äù, which I refer to as the lack of action on my part that has caused my relapsed. 

AA must be practiced in all of our affairs. I must practice sobriety not only in AA, but other human interactions.

"I've been drinking a lot the last few years... a lot of due to help with my mental health problems. But my triglyceride levels went from 150 (borderline high) to 269 in 1 year. I think its partly due to my medication but also partly due to my drinking. I have about 4-5 drinks a day. So I guess I technically am qualified as a heavy drinker.

But anyway I want to get help... I know 4-5 isn't as much as most other ""alcoholics"" but I still find it difficult to quit... It's like I can't go a day without having a drink. And 1 starts the ball rolling till I drink usually 4-5. 

So anyway I would like to attend an AA meeting but what can I expect? Also I hear (don't know if this is true) AA is pretty Christian, and I am a Hindu. I don't wish to be converted or talk about Jesus or have people force Christianity on me. Also is it just me sitting there listening to a speaker? Or how do things generally go?

"Hello everyone,

I don‚Äôt know where else to ask this but I thought this was the best place to go.

My father has been an on and off AA member my entire life. He recently had 2 years of sobriety, and I (21M university student) moved in with him in august. He pays all the bills. He has since relapsed and is becoming increasingly worse (calling in sick to work etc). He is not responding to reason or anything and is becoming very defensive. I am worried about his ability to pay our bills and for his mental health. It is interfering with my serenity and making me very unhappy.

What do I do?",alcoholicsanonymous
"My sponsor has started working away and has missed a few of his meetings that he chairs recently. He has asked me to co-chair a few times and I have gratefully taken the opportunity.

Our meetings are not quite 100% standard as I understand. They don‚Äôt include a main share as it was very difficult to organise during Covid and actually I‚Äôve come to prefer it.

However, this does mean that whoever chairs the meeting needs to select a reading. So, this is falling to me today and is likely to happen probably 50% of the time in the future. Again, fine, and whilst we may in the future seek a more reliable chair, now isn‚Äôt the time and this isn‚Äôt the thread to discuss.

I am asking whether you could help me out with a list of your favourite AA reading taken from any of the literature you have. We don‚Äôt stick 100% to the big book, so I‚Äôm totally open to what you would suggest and just as important why? Why is it your favourite reading?

"Hi my name is Stella, I'm 20 years old, and I'm almost a month sober. It's been hard for me to get to this point, my relationship with alcohol was abusive to say the least, often when drank I did so until I made myself sick or blacked out. 

It feels so good not having to worry ab not knowing where I will wake up the next day, or who I was in bed with, or if I'll be in good enough condition to get my classes or schoolwork done the next day, and knowing that my friends here on campus don't have to worry ab me and my safety.  I tried not to drink around people so they didn't know the extent of my problem, but many of my closest friends still knew there was no covering that from everyone.  My problem got to its worst during the start of the pandemic when I had many days alone in my home with nothing to so but drink and tried to kill myself due to depression.

But now, this is the longest I've gone without a drink in a long time, I feel so good ab myself.  Nearly everyday I get feelings of how I want to give in and just have a drink but then I remember why I stopped in the first place, and I have amazing friends behind me to support me. If you are in a situation like me, please try and fight those urges now. I was able to recognize that I had a problem before it destroyed my life, but for many stories that I've seen here that isn't the case. But no matter how far you are in its never too late to better yourself and get out from this.",alcoholicsanonymous

"A NECESSARY PRUNING

... we know that the pains of drinking had to come before sobriety, and emotional turmoil before serenity.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 94

I love spending time in my garden feeding and pruning my beautiful flowers.  One day, as I was busily snipping away, a neighbor stopped by.  She commented, 'Oh!  Your plants are so beautiful, it seems such a shame to cut them back.'  I replied, 'I know how you feel, but the excess must be removed so they can grow stronger and healthier.'  Later I thought that perhaps my plants feel pain, but God and I know it's part of the plan and I've seen the results.  I was quickly reminded of my precious A.A. program and how we all grow through pain.  I ask God to prune me when it's time, so I can grow.

"After working the steps and getting honest for the first time ever, I realized that I used medical professionals to justify my drinking / drug abuse. Basically the epitome of the ""if you had my life, you would drink like I drink "" syndrome. 

I had an alcoholic father that was the kind to tell my mother that if she left him, he'd kill all of us. So we ran around the country hiding during my childhood.  New schools every few months because he would find us, etc. I saw a lot of violence blah blah. So my mom tried her best to help me and had me seeing counselors really young. 

I learned right away these counselors show sympathy for you when you tell them things.  They told me I've seen too much. That im traumatized. That im different than normal healthy kids and im going to need ongoing treatment, likely forever. As I grew up, I was diagnosed with more and more. PTSD, bi-polar disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and panic attacks. They even told me that I had a chemical imbalance. That i lacked the natural ""feel good"" chemicals normal people have... And I was prescribed more and more. 

People with fancy degrees assuring me that I have valid medical and psychological issues requiring chemical treatment. Shit... Thats all you had to say!

Of course if I have to be medicated to live through all my mental issues and chemical imbalances, I may as well be the one to choose which meds make me feel better. The ones they prescribed really never did much for me. After much experimentation, I settled on liquor being the most effective chemical solution.  It was the only thing that worked AND it was all natural, legal, easy to get, and didn't require a prescription and dependence on the medical industrial complex. Win-win.

Then I drank to a point of dependency where when they separated me from liquor, I had a seizure, respiratory failure, delirium tremens, and had to use a walker to learn to walk again.  Liquor quit working and I was out of options. The plan was to go to AA a bit to show my family that I at least tried something before drinking myself to death.

A little over a year sober and I recently got to step 12 with my sponsor. I finally got honest. Im not crazy. Im just a drunk! I don't have PTSD, just been through a bit more drama than some.  Drama, not trauma!  I needed a spiritual solution, not a chemical solution this whole time. 

When I stopped living in the problem and started living in the solution, the problem went away! Thanks AA!",alcoholicsanonymous

"Tdr; How do AA members feel about psychedelics, using them in a professional setting to explore one's spirituality. 


Hey everyone, I'm an alcoholic. 

I've been sober for a little over 3 years, have not been to an AA meeting since picking up my one year coin. Did my 90 in 90 to start off and walked through the 12 steps with a sponsor, over my first year in AA. Let me start by saying AA and my sponsor ABSOLUTELY saved my life. I still make a weekly gratitude list, still meditate, still journal daily, and still keep in touch with many others in my home group. 

I left due to absolutely loathing the idea of giving it up to a higher power. I know I'm a cliche, just an atheist struggling with the concept like many others I suppose. I'd you've read into Bills past you'll know he's ran into similar situations and also medically took LSD, and it rejuvenated is spirituality if you will. 

I would like to use the psychedelics as a way to explore my own spirituality.  I've volunteered at John's Hopkins for studies, this would be something I would like to do with professionals as I've never done it before. I was more of a blow and whiskey guy.

"Hi, I consider myself a ‚Äòproblem drinker‚Äô, but not sure if it means I‚Äôm an alcoholic as such? I‚Äôve always used alcohol as a crutch, in an unhealthy way. At one time when I was younger I used to drink all day including before and during work, to combat social anxiety. Over the years I‚Äôve noticed that I drink more than my peers and in bad times, drink quite a lot, most nights of the week. But then again there have been months and years where I‚Äôve not been a problem drinker at all, drinking similar amounts as others or much less, and only at weekends. 


Over the past year I‚Äôve been drinking a lot at weekends, sometimes everyday, getting drunk in the early evening and my family have expressed concern. After that happened I did manage to reduce it to about 3-4 times per week and drinking a bit less. But over the last couple of months I‚Äôve been drinking every day (with a few days off in the last couple of weeks). I‚Äôm out of work at the moment so no routine or motivation not to drink. About a bottle of wine and a half each evening. It‚Äôs not huge amounts but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy and it is effecting me the next day, eg super hangover. I don‚Äôt have the shakes or anything like that and I don‚Äôt believe any kind of physical addiction. Would you say I‚Äôm an alcoholic?


Also, I am currently under psychiatric support for major depression and suicide attempt. I see a professional once a week to discuss my treatment and progress. A number of times over the past year they have asked if I‚Äôd like to be referred to the alcohol support workers. I‚Äôve always declined as I‚Äôve not felt I‚Äôm at that point and also feel a bit embarrassed seeking alcohol support when I‚Äôm only drinking a bottle and a half of wine a night. I know some people can drink a lot throughout the day so would feel like I was wasting the professionals time who could be helping others who are having a tougher time. Do you think I should be referred?

A month after I got sober I fell pregnant. I now have a 12 week old. My year of sobriety almost feels like I cheated.. because I wouldn‚Äôt have drank pregnant, and didn‚Äôt with my first born. It feels almost like in reality it‚Äôs only four months sober.

"Content warning for obvious reasons including relapse, bodily harm, and fire. Someone I know from the program relapsed and while they were high not long ago they set themself on fire accidentally. They burned their entire face, part of their arm, and their hand. I guess they were setting something on fire and accidentally switched up their lighter fluid container with a container of gasoline ( ??!!!?!) and they caught fire. They could‚Äôve died. Their face looked terribly injured obviously. They have gone through several procedures like skin grafts already and their injuries and appearance have come a long way, but they do not look the same and I can‚Äôt imagine they will ever really look like what they did before setting themself on fire. I will say they look the best I‚Äôve ever seen someone with that intense of facial burns look after reconstructive surgery or whatever procedures were done, so they are lucky for that and that they are safe and didn‚Äôt die. Still, of course no one wants to go through that and that‚Äôs got to be a horrifically traumatic thing to go through and live with for the rest of your life. This is what relapse looks like though. This could be any of us if we don‚Äôt get and stay sober.

Things don‚Äôt stay like they were the last time you drank or used. They don‚Äôt get better. It‚Äôs not chill. They always get worse, and usually they get worse much faster than the time before. Alcoholics and addicts cannot learn to use or drink in a normal, social, safe way. We cannot. I‚Äôve tested it and failed. The first time I got sober I thought maybe I wasn‚Äôt realllyyyyy an alcoholic because I hadn‚Äôt gone to jail, ruined a marriage, lost a career, etc. I went back out and then guess what happened? I ended up going to jail 3 separate times when I was 21 because I got 2 duis a couple months apart. I was lucky I didn‚Äôt hurt somebody else or myself or crash. I‚Äôm sure that would‚Äôve been in my not so distant future had I not been stripped of my ability to drive then gotten sober. I‚Äôve been sober thanks to my higher power, my people, and this program for 5 years. You all can do it, too. Really, if I can, you can, too. I was fucked. There‚Äôs plenty of times I could‚Äôve died. 

Back to the person with burn accident. They‚Äôve got several kids. What‚Äôs next after you burn your fucking face off? When is it enough? Now the hospital is giving them heavy drugs for their pain, which I‚Äôm sure they honestly need right now, but will this be their wakeup call? I know them pretty well, and sadly I don‚Äôt think so. It *might* be one of the many wakeup calls they‚Äôve had through the years where they try again for a bit and then relapse again in a few months or a year. I kind of doubt they aren‚Äôt driving their kids around while they‚Äôre high. Will they get into a wreck while high with their kids in the car? I sure as fuck hope not, but these are the thoughts and worries you have about someone when they‚Äôre already at the point where they‚Äôve accidentally burned their face off while high. 

They are a person who has probably been to rehab about 7 times at this point over more than a decade I‚Äôm pretty sure. I used to be their sponsor, so I know what they‚Äôre like and why they haven‚Äôt stayed sober. They made excuses all the time from the very beginning on why they can‚Äôt do 90 meetings in 90 days for example. They didn‚Äôt give their all and put their heart and soul into their steps. They‚Äôre a bullshitter. They lash out and cast people out of their lives when they try to tell them the truth for their own good. They surround themselves with yes men who oftentimes use them. They are not rigorously honest. They seem so self-deluded that they believe their own lies even when they‚Äôre sober and of course more when they‚Äôre not sober I‚Äôm sure. They‚Äôve lost custody of their kids before. And those kids are fucking awesome. This person is also fucking awesome when they want to be and are fully capable of succeeding, being a great parent, and going on to help other people and live a good life, but they have not done the things they need to do to stay sober. Don‚Äôt take that path. I beg you. It breaks my fucking heart.

I‚Äôm not sharing this to shame anyone or any actions. I know this is a horrible and debilitating disease and I made my fair share of awful decisions that hurt myself and others before I got sober. Hell, I‚Äôve done some dumbass shit in sobriety, too, but I have kept moving forward and growing and doing the shit I need to do to stay sober and make progress. This is seriously a simple program. Yes, it can be hard as hell sometimes, but if you make excuses and don‚Äôt keep going, you will pay the price and so will the people who love you. I just wanted to share this because this news has shaken me to my core, and it has reminded me of the reality of this disease and made me even more grateful to still be sober. The tragedies we and others go through are awful, but they are the truth of the disease of alcoholism and addiction and we have to remember that. Let them be a lesson and a time to check in with ourselves and be grateful for what we have. 

TLDR: Someone I know relapsed and accidentally set themself on fire while high and burned their entire face. They could‚Äôve died. They‚Äôre an awesome person when they want to be when they‚Äôre sober, but they are a chronic relapsed because they don‚Äôt do the work to stay sober. This could be me or any of us if we relapsed. The consequences of this disease are absolutely brutal and just get worse and worse each time we relapse or the longer we keep drinking. Please do what you need to do, because you can get and stay sober. I‚Äôve been sober 5 years. Pretty much anyone can do it if they work the program. Don‚Äôt let yourself and your loved ones go through anymore tragedy because of alcohol or drugs.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Lately I have realized I have an alcohol problem. I want to be sober. And I was sober for months. But sudden relapse again. And each time it is the same process ‚ÄúI will just have a drink like a healthy adult- moderation is key‚Äù and before I know it, I am shit faced, not myself. My father is a heavy alchoholic and we don‚Äôt talk anymore because of his alcohol issue. But now I realize I am becoming like him. 
I am not myself. I become someone I HATE. And I cannot sabotage my relationships anymore. 

Please help me through online resources and apps for this. What is the process to being sober and BEING accountable? I am very new to this.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hey guys, I figured I would reach out to some kind of community because I‚Äôm really not in a good place right now. I‚Äôve been abusing alcohol for something like 20 months now and I‚Äôm turning over a new leaf today. Drug abuse in my family is very common, and I don‚Äôt want to end up like my grandpa who I‚Äôve never seen in my life. I know that I have an addictive personality and I am just done. I just bought a dab pen last month and I can tell that if I don‚Äôt stop I will easily get addicted to marijuana as well. I know as of now that I want to change because I missed my sisters birthday party yesterday. My life is spinning out of control and I am ready to start my life over with absolutely no drugs of any kind.

"SERENITY AFTER THE STORM

Someone who knew what he was talking about once remarked that pain was the touchstone of all spiritual progress.  How heartily we A.A.'s can agree with him...

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 93-94

When on the roller coaster of emotional turmoil, I remember that growth is often painful.  My evolution in the A.A. program has taught me that I must experience the inner change, however painful, that eventually guides me from selfishness to selflessness.  If I am to have serenity, I must STEP my way past emotional turmoil and its subsequent hangover, and be grateful for continuing spiritual progress.

"Hey guys, I‚Äôm 19 and my partner is 20. We have a little 4 month old daughter. When he was 18 a close friend of his drowned, ever since he has been drinking a lot, and it‚Äôs just getting worse every day. His daily intake is always over 2 litres of alcohol and he starts as soon as he wakes up, he‚Äôs never sober any more and it‚Äôs really hurting us all as his family. There‚Äôs nothing I want more than to be able to understand him and support him but I don‚Äôt know how to do that. I know that telling him he‚Äôs drinking too much does nothing but stress him out, but there are times that I‚Äôm genuinely worried he will get badly hurt because he‚Äôs so drunk so I have to say something. I would love to be able to talk to someone who really knows what it feels like. If anyone has anything they can share it would be greatly appreciated x",alcoholicsanonymous
"I have 14 months of sobriety. 

I just found out the my SO of 9 years was having an affair.  I don't know for how long or how many people.  I guess it doesn't matter.  I kicked her out 26 days ago.  We have a daughter together (6 yo).  

I'm having trouble working my program into this shit hurricane.  I know the book says that acceptance is the key.   I'm working on accepting that this happened.  

I don't know how to treat my ex now.  A lot of infidelity material that i've read suggests using ""justifiable anger"" to fuel getting through this and make myself a better person, and make a better life.  But the BB says that anger is the luxury of normal men.  And justifiable resentments are probably the most dangerous. 

I don't feel like drinking over this.  I want to do the next right thing so I can make it out of this happy, and keep my daughter happy and protected.  

""We realized that the people who wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick. Though we did not like their symptoms and the way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too. We asked God to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend. When a person offended we said to ourselves, ‚ÄúThis is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be done.‚Äù

I am having a hell of a time balancing boundaries/not taking any more bullshit with the 'tolerance, pity and patience' part.  She's already sleeping with other men, and then texts me the next day that she misses me. 

I have talked to my sponsor, but he is in the middle of a lot right now in his life, and I can't get his input as much as I would like.

Has anyone here gone through something similar?  Does anyone know of specific AA literature that deals with being the betrayed one in an affair?",alcoholicsanonymous

I‚Äôm now sat crying myself to sleep for the second time tonight, knowing I don‚Äôt deserve sympathy but craving comfort of some kind. I tossed the duvet at him and told him to fuck himself because he‚Äôs rightfully too angry to care about my needs and I barely had any and I‚Äôm just fed up of trying to self sooth. So I‚Äôm sat on the bed freezing, with nothing but a thin bedsheet half wrapped round me crying my eyes out wondering if I can climb out the window and jump. I don‚Äôt want sympathy I just want someone to make me feel like I‚Äôm not a total piece of shit before I make things worse and do something I will regret.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I don't drink much often.  Maybe once a month.  I know I can't handle much alcohol.  I've never built up a tolerance to it.   My husband has liver disease and had to quit drinking.  If I drink anything, he accuses me of being an alcoholic.  He quit without any help, and I'm proud of him.  But once in awhile, I enjoy having a cocktail after dinner.  It really calms my anxiety, which I'm not medicated for.   He's never been a raging alcoholic, he just drank too much beer.  If I have a drink, he angrily goes to bed.  I only buy small amounts of alcohol that he doesn't like anyway.  I'm not a beer drinker, and he only drank beer to my knowledge. 
I want to help him.  I want to be supportive.   But I really enjoy a glass of wine or a cocktail sometimes.  What's the best way to go about this?  Do I need to stop all alcohol indefinitely too?
Thank you in advance.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I'm an alcoholic that has worked the steps and my life has improved greatly. The obsession has been lifted and secondary addict behaviors have faded away (except half a pack a day). 

I have a sponcee that has traded a drug addiction for addiction to work. Workaholism is far safer and better for my sponsee than alcoholism / drug abuse; however, the malady is the same and it's made me question my prayer and meditation practices.

I've found that I pray and meditate most of the day (not to the point of interfering or harming my daily life). I find that I have an ever increasing connection to my higher power (I use Nature or the Spirit of the Universe and say God for ease). The connection I feel towards God gives me a sense of belonging, euphoria, and serenity.

Is it possible that I have become addicted to the pleasant feelings of serenity that I get through prayer and meditation? Does this thought make any dang sense?

"Hello everyone, this is my first post and I need some advice and was hoping to find help here.

I rarely drink alcohol, but when I do, it's mostly a lot (like on parties etc.). A year ago I had a very bad night on a party, where I can't remember to much. I was talking lots of stuff that didn't make any sense and I was acting really strange, according to the people who were with me.

Almost the same happened last night. I was partying after the clubs just opened again. In my memory I got in trouble with some people and was followed by these as well. I called my mother out of fear and after I sobered up, she told me that I was talking a lot of nonsense.

I am not sure what exactly happened and what this could be, but after looking through the internet, I stumbled over the so called ""alcohol psychosis"".

As I'm really concerned and dont know what to really do, I was hoping to find someone who can relate to this and give me some advice..

( alot of other crazy stuffed happens) when ems an police arrived) my parents where there to witness it, as the police took her away to the hospital she cried i was going to leave her. 

i had to work a program more than ever through these times, a lot of support, hospital visits, educate myself on mental health an how to cope and talk to her. i ended up on sleeping pills and anti depressants and seeing a shrink. our relationship has never been the same. iv been kind and empathetic, always told her im not going anywhere ill always be here for you. i learned to not take the abuse personal i even justified it in my mind. its been hell.

prior to covid and this diagnosis our life was normal an healthy, she had her struggles with family resentments and hated her job etc etc. this relationship seemed like the only good thing in her life we bought a home together, got engaged then things went downhill. shes quitting her job blocking some her families numbers, now shes bitter and hates me and is packing her stuff said she loves me 5 days ago and now shes gone like a fart in the wind.

"I did quit AA once, right at 50 weeks sober.   I was really working the program during that time, taking it seriously.  Working the steps with my sponsor, leading meetings, listening to audiobooks, etc.  But I was missing something from Step 1.  I was willing to admit my life had become unmanageable, but I had doubts about being ""powerless over alcohol.""  I thought I could go back to it and it would be fun for the holidays.  

What ensured once I picked up the drink again was nothing but pain and remorse.  From the very first night to 65 days later when I nearly died.  Then I became convinced that I was powerless over drinking and I got the impression the Universe was making sure I had no mistakes about it!   During that time,  I wrote down everything that went wrong it was 3 pages of negative things and disasters.  Starting with my son crying because I did not get the 52-week chip!

I feel a loss when people tell me they did AA for *x* months to a year and quit going to meetings because they don't drink anymore.  They believe they're all better.  I know what that feels like, but the truth is recovery takes time.  For me I had to **learn to live my life sober,** to beat back the anxieties of life.  To finally be able to sit quietly with me without reaching for a drink or a drug or some other addictive filler (shopping, eating, obsessive behaviors, overfocusing on things, too much work, too much exercise).  For me, there is a second part of the AA program where my life got immensely better.  The barbaric behavior went away and I started looking after others.

Anxiety and malaligned behaviors were my biggest challenge.  Next year will be 3 years sober before the incident(s).  This whole past year has been filled with an intuition that only the Universe could provide.  I reclaimed my career after two years of searching.  My immediate family doesn't drink anymore because of what happened.  I'm helping my sister get sober.  I amended relationships and those people went off to mend ties with their old friends.  It's been the *AA Promises*

I often say, ""I'm learning to live my life sober"", but I think it takes time to see it.  To get to that point where the things I learned in AA extend way beyond just not reaching for a drink, but onto having an amazing life.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I finally came to a realization that I am an alcoholic. It all started 3 years ago‚Ä¶ I was what you can call a high functioning alcoholic. I fell into a deep depression after having my last child. My last two are only 17 months apart and being the only one to care for them really took a toll on me mentally. And so I turned to drinking in the shadows. I had bottles hidden in the apt, my car. In random cups to disguise that I was drinking. No one really knew because I still handled tasks in my day to day life. Over the course of the years I was drinking on and off. Was able to quit for 5 months last year while quitting with my then boyfriend but eventually with our break up, life stresses and chaos I picked up that bottle again. Living on my own it became even worse because I sat alone in my thoughts and I lost the will power to stay focused in workouts and I let alcohol consume me and ruin my friendships, my family, my work and my relationship. My life became unmanageable. I moved out of state 2 months ago and being away from all my family took a toll on me daily. There came the alcohol, the only thing to comfort and numb me in the shadows. I isolated myself to my room and drank every night and day letting depression and anxiety keep me down. I let alcohol once again take control of me whether I was alone or surrounded by my kids. I had the desire to quit, I was missing out on so much in life including being present in my children‚Äôs. I mentioned it to my family that I wanted to quit. Earlier this week I came out of work to a letter from my son with a picture of my kids. In the letter he‚Äôs talking about how he and his siblings are there for me and how proud he is of me for making the decision to move here, for all my hard work at work and at home and for the then 3 days I didn‚Äôt have a drink. It was his letter and appreciation and acknowledgment of my efforts that helped me walk through the doors of my first AA meeting yesterday. It was the best thing I could‚Äôve done. I felt welcomed and my heart at peace to hear everyone else share their stories and to be able to relate to each person. One person said‚Ä¶ we are here to help you on your journey, only you can love and help yourself first and if you don‚Äôt love yourself, we will all love you and be here for you to support you until you learn to. I received my first sobriety chip and it was the best feeling in the world. I have now made it through one week and have been to 2 AA meetings. A woman I met who is 6 years sober has been texting me to encourage the meetings and has been nothing but great support. I have not yet found a sponsor but that will be my next step.

"I‚Äôve never had trouble staying away from alcohol for long periods of time, but when I do drink I majorly over do it which is why I consider myself to be an alcoholic. I‚Äôve made the decision not to drink anymore at all. 

I‚Äôve decided to work through the steps with a therapist instead of going to meetings because I have extreme social anxiety and after going to meetings I don‚Äôt think it will work for me. It just has not been easy for me to even attempt to share in front of people.

I‚Äôm worried that my mom who has been in the program for a very lengthy amount of time, will be disappointed in this decision I‚Äôve made. I‚Äôve spoken to my doctor about it and he thinks this will work best for me as well as he has always been aware of my other mental health problems and is my primary care physician. 

I would appreciate any advice on how to relay this to my mother without feeling like I‚Äôm disappointing her as that tends to be a trigger of a lot of anxiety for me. I know this decision is right for me, but I also know she thinks the only way is AA.

"Today I have five months sober from alcohol and benzodiazepenes.

 Here is a little back story:

A few years ago, my little brother was killed in a farming accident right before I entered law school. This led to a series of events that would include to me drinking a fifth or two of hard liquor everyday combined with around 10-12mg of Xanax or 18-20mg of Klonopin. I was also doing MDMA 4-5 times a week, and occasionally smoking crack and meth. I did this on a daily basis, save for the occasional week or two of guilt related abstinence. Inevitably, I lost my scholarship and was reprimanded for frequently going to lectures under the influence. My fiancee left me, and I accidentally overdosed on a Xanax laced with fentanyl in August of 2020. This was still not enough for me to stop. I was essentially in a semi-permanent state of blackout, my ability to plan, reason, or even remember basic details about important events was almost non-existent. I struggled to maintain employment, and got to the point where I was isolating from the few remaining people that I hadn't alienated. After a couple failed stints in rehab, this all came to a head when in April, while on my way to cover a baseball game for the local newspaper, I got a DUI. I blew a .27, and was promptly fired. 

So then I unsuccessfully tried to drink myself to death. Once I had drained my bank accounts into the red, I didn't know what to do. Out of money, friends, food, booze and pills, I knew if I was going to continue to live, I needed to get help. Luckily, I found a halfway house a couple hours away that my insurance covered who said they would admit me. The problem was, it required 72 hours of sobriety. So the next day I found a ride, lied about how long I had sober, and checked myself in. I had the experience of going through extreme withdrawal without the aid of any medication over the next couple weeks. Eventually, I leveled out and I was surprised when my mind cleared a lot quicker than I expected. I became dedicated to my recovery, and attended the 90 meetings in 90 days that so many AA's deem essential.

After three months, I had secured a decent paying and stable job working at the corporate office of a bank. I got my own apartment, and moved out of the halfway house. My DUI got dismissed on a technicality, and my license was reinstated. I even got admitted into graduate school at the local university to get my MBA in Accounting.

But the thing is, I started smoking weed again a couple months ago (I live fairly close to a dispensary). Having PTSD and chronic pain from a motorcycle accident some years ago, it seems to be the one thing other than alcohol which gives me psychological relief. I know this is frowned upon, but I gotta say, it's working. I feel a lot more grounded and less depressed. While I have heard countless stories about people relapsing on their drug/drink of choice after resuming cannabis usage, I have not had that desire whatsoever. 

This choice has led to issues related to my local AA circle. After telling my girlfriend in confidence, she broke up with me over it, and started telling people I had relapsed at meetings when I wasn't there. Friendships have ended, and I have been lying about it to my sponsor to avoid judgment. 

I feel like this response is counter-intuitive to the purpose of AA, of which the only requirement is a desire to stop drinking, which I did. Now I'm in a position where I need to choose between my own mental health, or acting like a had some big relapse to appease these fair-weather friends in the program. Truth be told, I'm a little disgusted. It all comes off as disingenuous, where uncompromising adherence to the accepted status quo (not even principles or steps) is required for support and acceptance, and I'm not about that. I don't think I should have to change what is working for me to get the approval of people that are blindly following their ""crowd"" with little to no independent thought about the real complexity of addiction, or how everyone's experience in recovery is different. I'm frustrated, and I feel a little betrayed by these individuals who I had grown to consider friends. 

Has anyone else experienced issues in their own recovery related to conflicting ideology with AA? Or perhaps anyone else who has successfully used medical marijuana in recovery?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love AA. 
I just simply can‚Äôt make it to a meeting *every* day. 

My new sponsor and her sponsor have been on my ass about not making enough meetings. The thing is, I‚Äôm a full time student and I work 2 jobs plus an internship. Before the semester started I had a lot more time for meetings. During the week now I simply don‚Äôt have time to get to a meeting every single day. They tell me to prioritize AA #1. What about my physical and mental health? Personally, I am so busy that I don‚Äôt even have time to think about a drink. 
I have 12 hour days when school is in session. By the time I get home I want to eat dinner, shower, relax, and be in bed asleep by 9 or 10pm. 
Sometimes I feel like an hour at the gym is better for my well-being than an hour at AA. I also call my sponsor every day and keep in contact with other alcoholics daily. I write the daily reflections in my journal every day and write on it. 
I‚Äôm staying sober, in my right mind, working my own version of the program. And trust me, when I am available,  I‚Äôm at meetings every weekend. I even chair a meeting every Saturday, and I have another service position. It just frustrates me when people assume things about me or my story and think that just because I can‚Äôt attend meetings every single day of the week that I‚Äôm not living in the program.",alcoholicsanonymous
"'THE ACID TEST'

As we work the first nine Steps, we prepare ourselves for the adventure of a new life.  But when we approach Step Ten we commence to put our A.A. way of living to practical use, day by day, in fair weather or foul.  Then comes the acid test: can we stay sober, keep in emotional balance, and live to good purpose under all conditions?

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 88

I know the Promises are being fulfilled in my life, but I want to maintain and develop them by the daily application of Step Ten.  I have learned through this Step that if I am disturbed, there is something wrong with me.  The other person may be wrong too, but I can only deal with my feelings.  When I am hurt or upset, I have to continually look for the cause in me, and then I have to admit and correct my mistakes.  It isn't easy, but as long as I know I am progressing spiritually, I know that I can mark my effort up as a job well done.  I have found that pain is a friend; it lets me know there is something wrong with my emotions, just as a physical pain lets me know there is something wrong with my body.  When I take the appropriate action through the Twelve Steps, the pain gradually goes away.

"Hi all,

2 years alcohol free here. Just got back from a data at a trendy restaurant. Being hip and all, water was served out of liquour bottles. ex. our table had a tequila bottle with water inside.

Even though I'm sure this tequila bottle had been cleaned out, it still made me nervous to drink water that had been in the same container as tequila. I did just want to go with the flow and so drank water out of this tequila bottle.

The water tasted like water, nothing funny about it, etc. But I am thinking about alcohol now - probably just a placebo effect. But I'm wondering if I could have ingested any tequila or other alcohol from this?

TLDR: IS it safe for recovering alcoholics to drink water out of tequila or vodka bottles that have been cleaned and refurbished as water containers?

Thanks.",alcoholicsanonymous

"So im (29m) coming up on 10 months sober and recently started working with a new sponsor and going through my steps for real this time (i half assed my way through them twice before, been in AA for 2.5 years now) and im doing everything my sponsor tells me to, sometimes reluctantly and argumentatively. After starting with him ive started hitting my knees and praying twice a day and i pray throughout the day when i get irritated. 

Things have generally been better but stuff still happens that makes it difficult fir me to trust gods will. Its extra difficult for me because i grew up christian but became a ""militant atheist "" as the big book and 12/12 says. So im earnestly trying but whenever i hit a speed bump or roadblock its so natural for me to see it as god working against me rather than for me.

I just prayed for god to help me accept the things going on as they are and to help me be ok. Then i felt the need to post this so im reaching out to you for answers since god supposedly works through people.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to help me out.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hello :) My father has been an alcoholic for about 27 years. He doesn't admit (well, he admitted once) and walks away on anyone who wants to talk about it with him. He refuses help. Recently he said he didn't know why he did it (drinking) and that he was gonna stop. Of course he wouldn't be able to do it by himself, but he denied external help like AA or a psychiatrist; and of course he started drinking again in less than a month.

Now, I don't live with him. In fact, I live in another state, but I'm visiting and I'm close to his house. We were supposed to travel together, but because he is drinking heavily again, I called it off and told him about it. But I still want to sit down and talk to him, in person, and be serious about this. I've scheduled and paid for a psychiatrist for him to go on Monday. So this would be the talk: I want to help you, please admit you need help, the psychiatrist it paid for.

But what is the best way to say this? I don't know how to talk in way that is 1) loving; 2) effective and 3) serious, having in mind that he is been an alcoholic for almost 30 years. What should be my approach? How not to offend him or get him defensive?

In his shoes, what would you like to hear from your daughter or anyone close to you that wants to help you? Or, if you're not a (recovery/recovered) alcoholic, have you ever helped anyone in this manner and what did work for you?

I really need this help.

Thank you very much.",alcoholicsanonymous

"LEST WE BECOME COMPLACENT

It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels.  We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

When I am in pain it is easy to stay close to the friends I have found in the program.  Relief from that pain is provided in the solutions contained in A.A.'s Twelve Steps.  But when I am feeling good and things are going well, I can become complacent.  To put it simply, I become lazy and turn into the problem instead of the solution.  I need to get into action, to take stock: where am I and where am I going?  A daily inventory will tell me what I must change to regain spiritual balance.  Admitting what I find within myself, to God and to another human being, keeps me honest and humble.

"As of today, I haven't had a drink or a drug in 8 years.  Last month was my 30th birthday.  I got sober, in AA, at 22.

Needless to say, when I was a kid or a teenager I didn't expect that by the time I was 22 I'd have already been an alcoholic and in recovery.  But that's how things ended up working out.

It's been a relatively tough year for me.  I've had a string of medical problems that, while none of them super serious, have been very annoying and made day-to-day life a hassle.  It all started with the realization and diagnosis that I had tinnitus and some minor hearing loss, presumably from too much rock and roll.  I never expected it to happen to me, but it did (protect your ears!)  Luckily it's not too bad, but it was hard to come to terms with it.  Some days I still struggle.

In the last few years since getting sober I took a liking to being fit and active.  Unfortunately, I pushed things a little too hard, and about 4 months ago I developed a pain in my foot that basically kept me off my feet for 3 whole months.  I decided to try swimming, and due to improper technique, I injured my back, too.  I was really angry.   It's like I couldn't get a good streak going.

But what they taught me in AA was ""life's terms, not mine"".  My foot has healed.  My back has healed.  I still have tinnitus but I've come to terms with it.  You know what would have happened back when I was drinking?  I would have self-destructed.  

Nowadays it's completely different for me.  I remember someone shared this at an AA meeting once: ""now I have problems, but I just walk through them"".  That's what I did.  One day at a time.  Despite the annoyance, frustration, and all the other crap.  Sometimes all you have to do is *keep going*.  I guess that's why they say ""keep coming back"".

Writing it all out now it all seems like pretty small stuff, but in the moment it's horrific.  It brings up the question, for me, of ""what the hell is even the point of all this anyway if it's just going to be one thing after another?""  That's what it brought up in me.  But I kept going.

And thanks to that, not only did I remain sober, but I also had the opportunity to do some really cool things.  I started reading a lot this year.  I took to writing more seriously.  I got more comfortable with myself and had an easier time doing what I wanted to do.  I didn't experience so much anxiety or depression.  I fell in love and enjoyed it.  

I think that's the greatest gift of sobriety: not only does it save us from self-destruction, it also gives us the opportunity to do something really cool with our lives.  It just takes a little patience sometimes.

If I had to draw any broad conclusion from these 8 years, it's that things *do* get better.  You have to be a little courageous, that much is true.  But you don't have to be superhuman.  All you have to do is follow your heart, and learn to trust.  If you can do that, somehow, things tend to work out.  It's OK to relax.  It's OK to be yourself.  It's OK to enjoy life. 

Life is truly beautiful, and I have sobriety and the foundation I learned in AA for giving me this second chance.

Best wishes to all.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I'm wrestling with a lot this morning. No so much the urge to drink as anger and guilt over various things. Some of it I deserve, some I don't. All of it is part of the process of my recovery and I'm attempting to embrace it on those terms.   


I spent part of yesterday reading the Big Book, in particular the chapters about the 12 Step Process. It's both humbling and liberating. This feels like the path towards letting go of what I've been and done and finding a new way to live.

"So I've been with my gf for over 3 years now and she has been very supportive of me getting help for my recently accepted alcoholism. In the past months I've been to a couple of rehabs and had 90 days under my belt Friday. However, Friday I slipped and had a few drinks at her apartment that I visit on the weekends because I live in a half way house that only allows overnights on the weekends. I'll provide better context.

So she works often times 7 days a week at bars that close very late, the one she works at majority of the time closes at 4am. So since I've been out of rehab and at this house, the past several weekends Ive been picking up her apt keys while shes at work and go to her place to hang out, enjoy not being around other guys in a home setting and enjoying her much more comfortable bed so we can spend sometime together when she gets off very late. Now we've had some strain in the past about her work life and how she can be not great at scheduling because often she'll sleep for 10 plus hours then go start into work mood (we agree she probably has a sleep disorder but that's another conversation). So the constraints of the house rules during the week and limitations of the weekend make it so there is super limited time together as is so this was a win win dynamic.

So more on how the life style conflicts. She mainly has only friends in the service industry and mainly spends non working hours of leisure at the bar(s) she works at or in a casual party setting aka alcohol around aplenty. The past couple weekends if I wanted to see her before she crawled into bed after the next day's sunup I would hang out at the bar shes tending and its a dive so there is time for us to steal little interactions and moments together. I was geniunely confident in my program to be able to hang out there but also had the ability to know when its getting too much and say Im going to leave. Kind of. The past three weekends I gently told her Im ready to go and she innocently did the ""sure thing! Give me a few to say goodbye and everything"" but still a few hours would go by. Or I would leave right when I wanted/needed to and when she would get off work early enough to where we could have some quality time one on one at her place (no innuendo intended) she chose or ""got guilted"" into staying out/ going out with her bar friends.

Which bring me to Friday. I walked into her room and theres a full glass of wine right next to her bed. This isnt the first time something like that happened, a couple weeks prior she had a plate with a small bit of cocaine left from hanging out with coworker friends. She did have issues with coke in the past but it is now a couple times in the span of a 6 months thing. I ask every so often about it and she assures its not an issue and I trust so I take that as it. So I drank that wine not cuz of her or the bad traffic or my depression kicking my ass that week, I drank because I chose to drink. All this focus on her choices and behavior, none of that is a deflection, I take fully ownership of my relaspe. I do. I told her what happened within 10 mins of her getting home, she yelled and called me a fucking asshole and said Im not allowed to hang out at her place like weve been doing anymore. After we both cooled down, I agreed that is probably a good call and I shouldnt be bar visiting anymore. Like the wine glass being around it close enough to smell it, was way too much for me. I told my sponsor the next day (I drank at like 2am on that friday so I told sponsor saturday).  But during the post confession talk she was crying saying she's scared our lives might not be capatable and she feels torn between me and bartending which she really does love.

And admittedly I have had a blinspot for her with asserting boundaries in the recent past. In the spring which I in the end stages of denial of my alcoholism, I told her I was having a bad week with drinking and was looking forward to an evening of quality time with her. We go to a nice dinner and movie, and after she wanted to keep the night going so she asked if we could go to a bar after the movie. I said okay as long as its not gonna be too late which was true but she ended up getting semi sloppy drunk (which is rare for her around me or not) so much so that when we were fooling around later that night I had to use our safeword because she was biting and scratching too hard to the point where she popped a blood vessel in my lip from biting.

The other big and recent example was we went to her cousin's wedding over the summer and this was after my first go in rehab and real attempt at sobriety. She asked if it was okay mutiple times for her to have only a couple drinks at the wedding which i really did think was fine. Well throughout the weekend she made several comments and I see it in her demeanor she was craving time with family (mainly her cousins that shes close with- mutiple of them have been in each others wedding parties including my gf  they just live all over the US). Seeing them take shots and get dancy she asked if it was okay if she drank some more which I said was fine. I was semi fine with it but on the 14 plus drive over she without prompting from me said she wouldnt drink period on the trip, so with some permission from the guidelines kept moving partially out of guilt from depriving her from a time with she was craving and/or the fear that she would low key feel I deprived her of it.

So semi in conclusion, I really do love this woman and she does me. She has been a catalyst for me seeking self improvement before and after admitting my disease. Friday evening did include a talk about how I havent put myself in smart situations but also reviewing how her/our social life needs readjusting. She cried and shes been feeling like shes been a bad partner. There's also a recent thing about we/she talked up so much about visiting me in rehab but overslept and missed the time window. I assured her she is absolutely not and she has helped me tremendously throughout our relationship. But there is strains. We are SO dependent on her schedule in order to see each other. Its always been like that in our relationship, spending time together on her terms basically. I explained to her Friday how cravings work and how scienctifically a craving can be as strong as the mental feeling of starving or being real thrist. I've asked her and she excitedly agreed months ago to go to Alano but still hasnt and now getting irked when i mention it since she ""is strapped for time."" But I think my fear over this leading to more conflict and to be super honest the downfall of our relationship culminated in me deciding to drink.

So TLDR: I am in early recovery and trying to avoid alcohol while my gf's lifestyle actively is surrounded by it. Also please advice on boundary assertion intricacies and relationship in recovery advice as well. Pardon the wall of text but yeah appreciate any help or words of wisdom.",alcoholicsanonymous

"8 months Sober. 

It's hard to explain where i'm at. On one side I have found the resilience to give up on something that once had it's claws all wrapped around my inner self. It dictated how I felt and whispered lies of comfort. 

Today I sit here, wondering what did it take? What has changed? Why when I think of drugs or alcohol do I no longer feel intimidated or drawn by it. Reading through my facebook posts from the last 8 months I come to realise that a lot of it is due to me facing myself. Yet lately, I find myself ignoring a lot. People I dearly miss and wish I had the courage to reach out to. Things I desperately would want to have the courage to undertake. All in all, life has truly been a blessing. I have met some wonderful people that have given me more to appreciate than just my own centre of a world. Look within myself is still a daily task. It's not a bad one though, it's alleviating to remind myself that I am not the center of things. Every day is a hill I climb in order to get closer and closer to my ultimate goal. And even If I never reach the top, I can find peace in knowing that i'm trying every day to maintain active what keeps me sober. I think back and as dark as things have been and sometimes still are, I really feel liberated. Truly find so much serenity in knowing that i'm doing best and upholding standards I strive to live up to every day.

I have so much gratitude for the people in my lives. Every single one them have brought me where I am today and I thank them for doing so. Wether for better or worse, I finally can say that i'm confident about how I feel. Will things get rough? Possibly. As long as I take it a day at a time and don't let my own head get the best of me, I know i'll be fine.

It is in the acceptance of how things are that I can find serenity. Finding peace and finding love is all that matters. I embrace life fully and feel it all again. Laughing like a child brings me back to a place of no sorrows. Allowing myself to feel is what truly is beautiful about life. Nothing compares to how determined I am to never go back to how things were. It wasn't so much about not drinking and so much more about not wanting to.

Today I can say confidently that I want to be sober and embrace the feelings that come with it. I no longer want to ignore and undermine myself. My feelings matter to me and I am ok with them being around. 

Thank you for taking the time to read,",alcoholicsanonymous

"THE CIRCLE AND THE TRIANGLE

The circle stands for the whole world of A.A., and the triangle stands for A.A.'s Three Legacies of Recovery, Unity, and Service.  Within our wonderful new world, we have found freedom from our fatal obsession.

- A.A. COMES OF AGE, p. 139

Early in my A.A. life, I became employed in its services and I found the explanation of our society's logo to be very appropriate.  First, a circle of love and service with a well-balanced triangle inside, the base of which represents our Recovery through the Twelve Steps.  Then the other two sides, representing Unity and Service, respectively.  The three sides of the triangle are equal.  As I grew in A.A. I soon identified myself with this symbol.  I am the circle, and the sides of the triangle represent three aspects of my personality: physical, emotional sanity, and spirituality, the latter forming the symbol's base.  Taken together, all three aspects of my personality translate into a sober and happy life.

"Every meeting I go to they talk about my past I'm at a loss I believed and still believe I might have schizophrenia I live in a tiny town everyone knows everyone 

I went to a group that wasn't AA but moreless the same thing run by a man who was 20 odd years sober 
I couldn't get 100% sober I made some bad choices while in this group and since then it has broken up I would always rembber the guy who ran it going behind people's backs and telling them personal things about that person for example if someone had being using/drinking in there room alone the past 2 years and told him in privet he would tell other people in privet then tell us not to discuss group anywhere else that was the first double standard 

I went to another drug and alcohol counseler after this and told her everything about that group thinking she would keep it confidential but she used it to try attack the person who made his own AA sort of group and now I'm the one who's to blame 

The reason I think I have schizophrenia is because when I'm in my town I see the guy who started the group and his son way to often and there useualy in the distance like stalking me 

I don't want to kill myself because when I'm out of the town I don't feel anyone looking at me it talking about me and I get approached by lots of people and have good conversations when I'm literally the next town over 


My town is full of truma and it seems every counseler I've ever put trust in has completely set me up and made me feel and look like a horrible asshole 

Confidentiality is a complete and utter lie unless that therapist is getting big money the rapist is what they should be called they raped my life without any fucking concent",alcoholicsanonymous
"I heard this when I first started coming and didn't believe it. I thought if I could only get this alcohol thing under control,  all would be well.

Turns out, even without the alcohol I am unhappy. Im an asshole. Im cynical. Im self centered. My nature is to hold on to grudges,  be angry, and to be unapologetic. Im a natural ""poor me"" kinda person.  So I started thinking; maybe my thinking is my problem. 

If I have busted thinking, how would I know? Would thinking about my thinking be enough to realize thinking is my problem?  

If Im walking around with a broken compass, how would I know its pointing the wrong way?  Even after I repeatedly end up in fucked up places, I just keep following this compass because its all I have to guide me.

Then people with perfectly fine compasses (like doctors, psychiatrists, judges, family members) try to tell me ""hey man, YOU'RE HEADING THE WRONG WAY"" and I just keep following this broken ass compass. These people don't understand and haven't had the shitty life I've had. Why listen to them?

Then I met other people in AA with broken compasses too. Its like a group of people said ""hey, we think our compass is busted too. We keep following it thinking we're doing good but then we end up in fucked up places again.  But there is this book and these 12 steps that are like a map. You can put down that busted-ass compass and follow this instead. Enough of us with severely broken compasses have made it out by following these. Give it a try.""  These people understand and have had a similar life. I can listen to these people.

Im SO grateful for this program for showing me the way. Ive had a profound change of thinking. I thought life was all wrong and unfair. I was actually living life wrong. No wonder it was so bad! 

Thanks for reading my rambles!",alcoholicsanonymous

"My biggest character defect is laziness. It's so difficult to do simple tasks at home like the dishes and laundry and I procrastinate so bad because of it. It's starting to effect me financially because I'm too lazy to make instant oatmeal for breakfast and pack a lunch for work so I'm spending on eating out and creating unnecessary stresses. It's effecting my step work too because I'm just too lazy to pick up a pencil to jot a few sentences down or read for a couple minutes. I end up procrastinating on that too and I don't feel like it's very thorough or heart felt.  I know some of has to do with a little fear too and possibly my will?

"I recently discovered that a girl I met on Tinder is an alcoholic. She‚Äôs been sexually abused as a child by her father (found out 2 days ago), lost a child 2 years ago, and has been through multiple traumatic events throughout her life that‚Äôs caused her to become suicidal.

She started drinking after her 4 month miscarriage. Her child was her reason to start living a productive and healthy life- then she lost her baby. She has no will to live anymore, and I‚Äôm incredibly worried about her wellbeing/desire to kill herself. 

We‚Äôve known each other for 3 months, and we met on Tinder. We‚Äôve basically just been fwb, and I have no desire to pursue sex anymore, so I deleted Tinder/all other dating apps, and was going to tell her I‚Äôm not interested in casual sex anymore. However, the past couple days she opened up about how she‚Äôs feeling, and her past. I only learned about her alcoholism yesterday, as she now has to go to the hospital for detox. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Taking care of her emotionally is affecting my schooling and my goals, but I‚Äôm scared to just leave abruptly due to her suicidal thoughts and alcoholism. I know she's going to relapse due to the grief of losing her kid. I can't let my life be affected by a girl I've only known for 3 months and was just a long-term hookup, but I also won't drop someone in their worst condition. 

Any and all help would be appreciated, thank you.",alcoholicsanonymous
"First time I drank was 17, it was during  quarantine when covid first began. Now I‚Äôm 19, at first it was just for fun. Never drank prior to that but I felt cool for drinking. I remember clanking bottles in the house to show my siblings I was drinking showing my friends, but now I‚Äôm embarrassed. It still is fun but I wish I didn‚Äôt need it to be fun. Now I feel like as if I need it to be myself, I can‚Äôt relax without it and I don‚Äôt want to imagine my future relationship to alcohol. Every time I go to work I drink, every time I go to school I drink, if I wanna hangout with someone I drink. I ran out of alcohol though, stole all my parents from their diy bar and my friend/hookup crashed their car so now I don‚Äôt have a hookup. Although I‚Äôve thought of lying to my brother and have him get some for me, and realistically I will. My parents still have a bit left, my father actually found a couple bottles in my room a little while back. I told him I drank them while I was with a couple friends. He dismissed it but I told him I‚Äôd pay him back, which is no problem at all but I want more. Idk if I want more or need more at this point, but I get annoyed very easily if I drink so little. I‚Äôll drink a few beers and that‚Äôs not enough for me, I don‚Äôt get buzzed like I would originally so I‚Äôll get upset.

"On February 12th of this year I was arrested for a 4th offense OWI. (My previous 3 were 10 years ago.) I spent 4 and 1/2 terrifying days in jail. I was blacked out when the arrest happened so I really didn't know what had happened until I got out. I started going to meetings the day after I got out of jail. Really threw myself into the program, got a sponsor, worked the steps and things slowly started getting better. 

I even made some friends, including a man with ""4 years of Sobriety"" that I became fairly close with. He ended up wanting to be more than friends, I told him I wasn't really interested in him like that but he was really, really persistent and to be honest it felt really nice to have someone pay so much attention to me. He was always there if I needed something and checked in on me. But he also had a tendency to gossip about other people in the program, telling me who was ""actually sober"" who smoked pot or did other drugs and it got in my head. 

The day after my 6 month mark I said fuck it and got drunk for 3 days. Came back, first stepped. Made it 2 weeks, and I hung out with the guy again. Found out that in reality he didn't have the 4 years he claimed and that he'd drank periodically over the past year or so. And we got drunk together, for like a week straight. He went to detox and I went back to my meetings again. I told him we couldn't hang out any more. But he didn't really like that and started pursuing me more intently. I relapsed again one night and I was really down on myself about it and didn't know who to turn to, I'd stopped communicating with my sponsor by that time and I just struggled to find the courage to reach out to anyone else. But he reached out to me and the morning after he came over to ""help."" He gave me one of his oxys (I don't even like opiates??) And then he left to go get us lunch. He came back with a bunch of alcohol and we got hammered. The next day I told him that I absolutely couldn't hang out with him or even talk to him anymore and to stay away from me. 

But I haven't stopped drinking since. That was 3 weeks ago. I've been completely isolating myself, embarrassed and drunk and feeling like a piece of shit. I'm scared to go back to my meetings because I don't want to risk running into him again and because I'm ashamed and embarrassed by my weakness. 

I'm really going to try not to drink today, and hopefully find a new meeting where he won't be tomorrow. But I'm still just so embarrassed. I felt like I was doing so well and everything just came crashing down around me. I'm tired of feeling worthless and stupid and scared of everything. 

I don't want to bring this story up at the meetings here because the AA world is small in my town and there's a high probability someone would know who I'm talking about and I'm not trying to throw him under the bus. I know he's sick too and it's not his fault, I drank because I wanted to drink, not because of anything he did, but at the same time it's not a good situation. 

How do I pluck up the courage to walk back in and admit my failure and start over? Ugh. This whole thing just sucks üòû

"It's three years to the day since my last drink. I barely remember it like it was yesterday. On my last night of drinking, I promised not to get drunk, then drank alone in a garage through the entirety of a child's birthday party, drove my family home (drunk) and faded to black. I was sitting in my first AA meeting less than 24 hours later. 

AA saved my life. I don't care if it's a trope. I am alive today because the people in those rooms took me in, showed me the way and I was beat down enough to listen. There are so many close calls, drunk accidents, fights, health and legal issues and insane decisions... I really don't know how I survived long enough to even make it to the rooms but I know I wouldn't have made it much longer. 

I'm posting today to share my hope. I used to think I was a mid-bottom drunk because I never killed anyone or went to jail. I later heard from others I was probably a low-bottom drunk based on my story. Eventually, I realized it didn't matter. I was just a drunk. The important part is the recovery - and I am, through the power of something greater than myself, recovered. Not recover-ING. Recover-ED. As the book says, I have ""recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body"" through the 12 Steps. 

Since entering the program, the promises in the book have been fulfilled in my life. I have a peace I've never had. I have patience, I love deeper, I can experience being loved, I can provide and be of service. My marriage was saved, I lost 40 pounds, our sex is 20x better, I make triple what I did when I was drinking, I paid off all my taxes, lawsuits, legal fees and maxed out credit cards. I am a father to my kid - like an actually present one involved in her world. I've dealt with mental health issues previously hidden by self-medication with drugs and alcohol. You literally would not recognize me, whether looking at me or my actions. I still have problems, character defects and struggle. It's not perfect and it never will be. But it doesn't have to be and I know no substance or destructive behavior is going to fill that hole. The longing I felt will sometimes return - and when it does, there is a solution: the 12 Steps.

If you're new, if you're suffering, if you don't know what is going to get you out of the hell you are in: I suggest you give them a real shot. Taken as prescribed, with rigorous honesty, they really do work. Essentially, they're a catalyst to spiritual experience, or ""limit experience"", some might say. A way to induce a radical change in the way you view the world around you - and really a change in yourself. They work.

If you've got less time than me, I hope reading this inspires you. You should know reading your experiences and struggles on this sub inspires me, bringing the brutal truth of alcoholism freshly into my memory. It has a habit of fading. You keep me motivated. I'm grateful to have talked with a lot of people from this sub, and hopefully helped. There is a way out and you are on the right path. 

If you've got more time than me, I'm inspired by your strength and experience. Thank you for being here and passing hope and knowledge on to us youngins. 

I am just overwhelmingly grateful to the program, the community, and my higher power. In the immortal words of the great Ye: ""he's done miracles on me"".",alcoholicsanonymous

A man came to the meeting drunk, interrupted the speakers, stood up and took his shirt off, staggered loudly back and forth for coffee, demanded to talk, and eventually called the group's secretary an unquotable name and walked out.  I was glad he was there ‚Äì once again I saw what I had been like.  But I also saw what I still am, and what I still could be.  I don't have to be drunk to want to be the exception and the center of attention.  I have often felt abused and responded abusively when I was simply being treated as a garden variety human being.  The more the man tried to insist he was different, the more I realized that he and I were exactly alike.

"I'm struggling a lot with my sobriety. I feel so weak and powerless over this substance. 

I made it 6 months from mid June 2020- early January 2021. Relapsed, drank myself silly for a month and ended up in treatment in February 2021-April 2021. I've been sober since February 7, 2021 so I've now made it 7 months sober (almost 8). However, now I'm feeling that compulsion to drink again. My partner supports my sobriety but I came to the realization I'm still uncomfortable even seeing him drinking in front of me when we go out. Almost all of my ""support system"" still drinks in front of me and I just realized I hate it. It's a stupid thing to be upset about, I know, and I can't tell if this is a normal reaction or if I'm simply being a diva. I even got invited to a birthday party but it was at a bar. I declined and said I didn't trust myself but wished them the best day.

I started a new job, ironically in a treatment center, and we take the clients to AA every Saturday. I don't participate but I suddenly feel the calling to attend one of my own. My only worry is if I'll find someone willing to sponsor me. I have massive imposter syndrome as I work in treatment and ask my clients ""How are your cravings?"" every day. When I ask myself this question, I'm still at a 6/7. I long for the day I am comfortable and happy in my sobriety. Someone please tell me it gets easier, you feel happier, and the cravings stop gnawing at you. It doesn't help that society is literally obsessed with alcohol. I can't watch a show without seeing a commercial for booze. 

I want to feel free. And I hope that AA is the first step to feeling freedom and peace...",alcoholicsanonymous

"My childhood wasn‚Äôt great. I was forced by my mother to be her personal therapist, she always dumped all her shit on me and blamed me for not handling it perfectly. I was sexually abused by multiple people growing up, and both my parents were violent, throwing things around and punching holes in walls. I turned to alcohol at 14, and was an alcoholic until 18, when what I‚Äôm about to describe happened. 

Due to my abuse I was weird at school. I confided in people too quickly, I couldn‚Äôt keep my hands to myself, etc. I didn‚Äôt know how to make friends. But one boy (also 18 at the time) in particular gave me the time of day. He was kind to me‚Ä¶ which was something that I was missing in my life. We began dating, but I was toxic. He cut me off, and I thought that if I really loved him, I couldn‚Äôt let him out of my grasp. 

I began stalking him and harassing him‚Ä¶ I followed him home from school, would try to talk to him, I created multiple social media accounts to message him to the point of him having to delete his social media‚Äôs, etc. But one night, I got really drunk, and the amazing idea of breaking into his house came to me. I went to his house and entered through an open window, which led to his little sister‚Äôs bedroom. In a drunken rage I began yelling at her, and he and his parents rushed into the room to try and get me out. They ended up calling the police and I was arrested, there was a trial, and I ended up going to jail for a year. 

Since then I‚Äôve been in therapy and have been required to do a 12 step program. I‚Äôm on the step of ‚Äúmaking amends‚Äù, and that brought this back up in my mind. I‚Äôm certain that I traumatized that family, especially the little girl‚Ä¶ do you think they would want to receive an apologetic letter from me?

TLDR: I had a boyfriend who I stalked, harassed, and eventually broke into his house and got arrested. Should I apologize?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi,

I'm a 24 year old and I feel like I might be developing a problem. I've had previous encounters with many substances and despite struggling with very addictive ones  (benzos) I managed to give them up all on my own and have never looked back. 

Here in Australia alcohol is the only accepted ""drug"" and weed and all other substances are frowned upon which is completely fine but as they say: ""Everyone has their poison"", and very early on 14 or so mine was alcohol. 

I was hospitalized, I've woken up hours away from my home, I've ran face first into a fish tank, I've never done anything malignant or harmful to other ppl beyond when I drove drunk and nearly drove off a cliff a few years back.  Despite mostly ending my own life, If the story was written different I could have harmed someone else. I've tried to end my life and resorted to self harm a lot because of the way I am.

when I'm sober I honestly believe I'm in control despite knowing the impacts it's having on my work, life, mental health, family and it ruined a great relationship 2 years back.

The saddest part is, part of me honestly believes I'm still winning and in control when I give it time. 

It's like I recycle shit emotions for new ones each time.

I might stop for a day or two and say ""never again"" but I'm right back at it once the guilt takes it's course.

We have a massive drinking culture here in Aus and a lot of my friends are bonded over a beer so in regards of feeling lonely it's difficult. I'm also quite shy and find a few drinks let me have a good time. But I can't stop and often prefer drinking alone, so despite seeing friends I'll end up going home and continuing the drinking alone.

I moved from spirits to beer which was a massive help. I could limit myself at least and keep track. But it became a heavy hitter on the bank and also despite never being over weight I started to notice a beer gut. 

But I find myself stuck in this loop of what I have is not enough, and I wake up depressed and anxious about my decisions and actions the previous night, although most are not terrible or destructive; mostly talking to friends a bit to lively than usual, or staying up too late, I draw the line at not being able to wake up for work and messaging ppl at stupid hours when most ppl have a life and aren't up all night. It's embarrassing... I have gotten far better at controlling that which also worries me.

I use to work at a liquor store and I finally got a new job which I hoped would set me straight, and it did but I've found myself stuck in this same loop of ""If I only buy 4 beers it'll be fine"" and end up sourcing alcohol elsewhere after. 

I've obviously tried not drinking, but alcohol is all over my house, I could walk blindfolded and run into a long island iced tea.

I guess I'm scared that once I stop that is it I can't ever drink again. I loose my social life, I get bored of hanging out with the people I grew up with despite majority of them being far more interesting than I am and I end up just living a life more or less dedicated to fuck all.

It's also very family oriented, I have to learn to talk to my own family without drinking and watching them drink. This is very genetic alcoholism runs in my family.

I'm aware I need to stop, to be honest its just really shit that I have to... And honestly scary.

I appreciate it's short sighted, but it's hard to see new doors opening when you're so focused on the ones you wish you didn't have to close. 

I don't expect ppl to have all the answers, but I'm very curious based off what I've told you, would you please enlighten me on what might help, profession help, or what helped you?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Sobriety has changed my life in so many ways despite it only being the very beginning of my journey.. But this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside (the way I used to claim alcohol made me feel, except this is a real feeling). 

My fianc√© is finally warming up to me again. My rock bottom wasn‚Äôt when I was hospitalized multiple times for alcohol poisoning, fired from my job, woke up in strange places, injured my neck or broke a rib‚Ä¶ What truly hit me and made me want to do this was my fianc√© being one and a half feet out the door‚Ä¶ Something about the thought of losing him made me take a long hard look at myself and something in my brain ticked and told me I HAVE to do this. I NEED change. For the sake of my life, my health, my future, my sanity and my family. I started putting in the work, attending meetings (sometimes 2 a day) and building a foundation to get and stay sober‚Ä¶ One day, one moment at a time. 

He started holding my hand and saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù first again‚Ä¶ He came on to me first for the first time in over a year. I can‚Äôt blame him since being 8 drinks deep, slurring and stumbling isn‚Äôt exactly a turn on. Nor was being depressed from booze or hungover‚Ä¶ 

I was horrible to him‚Ä¶ I was never mean or violent but him seeing me a drunken mess definitely took it‚Äôs toll. Him seeing me taken away in an ambulance or having to pick me up from a hospital cause I passed out drunk in public. Him coming home to seeing me passed out in the shower or after raiding the fridge. I was horrible to myself. I‚Äôd lie about how much I consumed and put alcohol before his feelings despite him always telling me (and me knowing yet denying) that it was a BIG problem. Nobody deserves to see their significant other in such a state‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm truly blessed to have another chance‚Ä¶ To be able to love myself and him right. To be able to show myself and him that I truly can change‚Ä¶ Oppose to making empty promises about ‚Äúnext time‚Äù like I used to. Promising that it‚Äôll ‚Äúnever happen again‚Äù‚Ä¶until it did‚Ä¶cause I didn‚Äôt take sobriety seriously or put in any effort whatsoever. But this time is and will be different. 

Yesterday we spent the entire day together.. We cuddled, held hands, played video games, went to the movies, laughed and enjoyed our time together. To truly be there for him‚Ä¶ for us.. Felt amazing. To live and appreciate every moment. Even just running errands with him. Unlike when I was a drunk and didn‚Äôt know how to appreciate the simple things in life‚Ä¶ Now every moment is a blessing. To have my best friend back‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how happy I feel..

The work must continue. I won‚Äôt stop now just cause I‚Äôm finally getting the love of my life back. This is only the beginning.

Sponsorship held two surprises for me.  First, that my sponsees cared about me.  What I had thought was gratitude was more like love.  They wanted me to be happy, to grow and remain sober.  Knowing how they felt kept me from drinking more than once.  Second, I discovered that I was able to love someone else responsibly, with respectful and genuine concern for that person's growth.  Before that time, I had thought that my ability to care sincerely about another's well-being had atrophied from lack of use.  To learn that I can love, without greed or anxiety, has been one of the deepest gifts the program has given me.  Gratitude for that gift has kept me sober many times.

"My friend and I are both 24 years old. I‚Äôve known him since he was 13. All our lives growing up he‚Äôs always had emotional issues. It all started when some girl broke his heart when he was like 16. He become bitter and got anger issues. As time went on he got better and when he was 19 he started taking up smoking weed. It seemed to help him mellow out a lot but I noticed over the years he become very in his head and depressed. About 2 years ago he started to date a girl who was an alcoholic, she ended up cheating on him and it really hurt him. What made matters worse is he picked up her habits of drinking along the way. Now as the years passed he‚Äôs been in and out of jobs and also has gotten into another relationship that he isn‚Äôt happy in (says he is but then will complain about what she does to him. Some of the stuff is brutal) They finally broke up and now I‚Äôm just worried about him because he can‚Äôt stop drinking, he‚Äôs depressed about this girl and might get back with her and he hasn‚Äôt had a job since May. As a friend how do I handle this?

It started out not that bad but once he got into this new relationship about a year ago it‚Äôs gotten so much worse. Before it was subtle but now unfortunately I‚Äôm embarrassed to go out in public with him because he‚Äôll start swearing and saying things out loud that you really shouldn‚Äôt. He also just looks not well kept. Weight gain, messy hair, untrimmed beard, dirty nails ect. It just looks like he‚Äôs given up and it hurts me to see.

Myself, his younger brother, mom and old work friends have reached our hand out to him numerous times and given so much advice but does the opposite of everything we tell him.

"Just today I realised that I'm a huge piece of shit. I used to think I was a good person with a problem that needed fixing but I realised that when it came down to it I was just a good person when it's easy to be but I realised that for the last few years whenever I had to make a decision between the right choice or the selfish choice to get fucked up on drugs/alcohol/sex ignoring my responsibilities and the well bring of those around me I always chose the selfish option because it made me feel good/happy for awhile without caring for the consequences to make myself feel better just because I had a fucked up life with long lasting trauma that doesn't mean I have any right to potentially fuck up someone else's to make myself feel better for a few hours.

These last few years have possibly been the worst years of my life so bad that I tried to commit suicide by overdosing a few months ago. I never intended to hurt people intentionally I would never want to hurt the ones I love and innocent people but I have destroyed good meaningful relationships and hurt friends and loved ones and I've even put people into dangerous positions where someone could've been seriously injured or even killed. Everytime I would blackout I always used to think these were mistakes and that I was just a danger to myself but I realise now they weren't mistakes at all and that my self destructive choices have harmed other people.

I chose to do this shit over and over and over again even when I knew what could happen and that once I start drinking I can not stop. Something deep inside me wants to self destruct. I have been battling alcohol abuse since I was a teenager but no one controlled me or forced me, I gladly and willingly chose the ""fun"" option to make myself feel better by self medicating over the right one even when I knew the potential consequences but ""this time I can control myself"" I would tell myself. I'm so lucky I have never seriously harmed or injured someone else and that the only consequence is that some people hate me and avoid me even after I have apologised and even though they've accepted and pretend it's okay now but I can feel it whenever I happen to see them and I deserve it.  I can live with people hating me for being a fucking mess but I would never be able to forgive or live with myself if I seriously harmed anyone or caused someone's death that wasn't my own.

The reason why I realised these things about myself is because I have very slowly managed to pull myself out of the hole I was trying to get out of for the past 6 years 
(I've been going to therapy and I've had about 10 different therapists, 3 different rehabs and psychologists trying to fix myself but fuck me it was a hard and terrible road for everyone.) and I can finally see things clearly without the cloud of self loathing and hatred obscuring my vision. I haven't blacked out in months and it's been almost a year since I've had a major incident and that's because I met a wonderful girl (she's honestly one of the best and most pure person I've ever met, thinking of doing something that would hurt her finally knocked some sense into me, everytime I think I might potentially hurt her feels like a punch in my gut. She doesn't deserve it and honestly I don't even deserve her she's too good for me) and with the help of my family who never abandoned me and has always supported me especially my poor father. I must've aged him by an extra 10 years.

I haven't eaten or slept in 2 days because the full consequences and scope of my actions have finally dawned on me after I returned from one of the best weekends of my life with my girl without using drugs or alcohol which is the first time in my life that I've had that much fun sober or fucked up.
 I admit it I'm an asshole, I'm a self centered, self hating piece of fucking shit and I couldn't even see it until now. But that all changes today.

This realisation is very hard to process and it's really hard to not hate myself for everything I've done even with all the progress I've made since. To those who I dont remember or who I never got the chance to apologise to. I'm so fucking sorry",alcoholicsanonymous

"
Since Ive been at university Ive used alcohol to get to sleep, which I think in lots of respects contributed to my psychotic episode last year. Since then my use of alcohol has spiralled, to a point where this weekend I had a bit of a breakdown and ended up in hospital after attempting to unlive. The doctors have said the best method for treatment is at home as Im not having any delusions, just a few auditory hallucinations. ive always been quite depressed so ive been feeling a bit hopeless about that ever changing. I was wondering if anyone could give some advice on how to continue without A:being intoxicated B:without the grand ideals which came with psychosis. I think have this really stupid god complex where i can only be content when life is extraordinary (e.g becoming a rockstar that makes people love eachother more, or an amazing relationship, or starting a revolution to dismantle capitalism, which in turn causes a much needed change in western culture). I know those examples are delusional but they aren‚Äôt delusions, they are just desires as I don‚Äôt believe any of those things would ever come true. I actually really liked being psychotic cause I at least believed they would come true, which brought me a lot of content. I think thats why I wanted to commit. Cause i dont want to keep working my ass off to feel no joy whatsoever. There is no meaning in working the 9 to 5 for the rest of my life to make someone else rich, when all i get back is social anxiety, depression and some money to pay for bills and booze.

I want to conclude by saying im not suicidal now, i want to get better, but i could use some help in finding out what kind of life i could live and how to deal with these frustrations.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I knew dating within the rooms or getting involved in any entanglements with someone you see regularly in meetings was probably a bad idea but I did it anyway. Needless to say, it crashed and burned pretty horribly and now I often run into this person at my home group meetings (three meetings a week that I go to regularly). It‚Äôs very awkward seeing him and sometimes downright painful but I refuse to stop going to the meetings that got me sober. 

I tried for about two weeks to go to other meetings but I just didn‚Äôt like them and didn‚Äôt feel like I connected or related to anyone. The person I was with has been going to the meetings for many years but I just refuse to let this person push me away from my sober support network. 

For added context I do have a sponsor and I am working the steps( I have not gotten to step 4 yet). I currently have 3 months of sobriety. I realize getting involved in a relationship in early recovery was a bad idea and I have already beaten myself up about it enough so need to drive the point home anymore.

"A week ago I relapsed after a half a year of sobriety under my belt. Throughout this time I began to find structure in my life, an inner peace began to develop and a stability I‚Äôd never encountered before while drinking. Passion for hobbies began to resurface. The feeling I chased in a bottle became the promise granted with sobriety. Heaven on earth wouldn‚Äôt be the way to describe sobriety; but even though the days felt longer and the temptation remained, it was worth it one hundred percent. 

When I relapsed, drinking felt different. I found that in comparison to the joy I found in daily life sober, the joy I found in strengthening relationships and putting my all into my work; being drunk just felt tiring. The feeling alcohol gave me felt synthetic, dulling my emotions and range of expression. Not to mention that afterwards I had nothing to show for it apart from an aching body and a looming cloud of depression.

I‚Äôm back on the bandwagon thankfully, going to meetings and taking it one day at a time. Though I will say this relapse was a huge reminder and positive affirmation, of why alcohol will be the devil I choose not to dance with. It pales in comparison to choosing life.",alcoholicsanonymous

Hi everyone. So I met a very sweet woman at AA a few days ago. She‚Äôs been super helpful with bringing me to meetings, introducing me to people and encouraging me but I feel like she‚Äôs also using me to vent and unload. She started gossiping about others who attend the same meetings as us. She talks a million words per minute and it really makes my anxiety go through the roof and I feel like it‚Äôs really damaging to my sobriety. It‚Äôs literally the entire ride to and from meets. Not a second less.

I really love that she‚Äôs kind and wants to help me. That she sees me as a person she can trust and open up to. But I feel like it‚Äôs just so she can complain to me and unload her problems/past traumas. I still have my things that I am trying my best to deal with sober and am only 8 days into this. I‚Äôm scared that this may eventually lead to my demise. I‚Äôve been trying so hard to practice mindfulness and stay positive. And I‚Äôve been doing great otherwise. People at the meetings tell me to stick with her. And I‚Äôm scared that if I tell her I can‚Äôt go with her anymore or tell her why that she‚Äôll either just show up where I live, start drama or spread rumors about me at the meets or who knows what else. I don‚Äôt want to be the one to potentially trigger a relapse either. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings and I get she‚Äôs also going out of her way to help me but my sobriety needs to come first for me. And I‚Äôm way too new to sobriety to be handling other people‚Äôs traumas like this. She‚Äôs told me way too much about her in the last few days and I‚Äôm still trying to cope with everything that has happened to me. Is this selfish of me? I know there‚Äôs a step that says to help others and that the program only works if you help others but I feel like I need to help myself first‚Ä¶.

Has anyone been in this situation before? What should I do? I don‚Äôt want to offend or hurt anyone. But I need to continue this path without my peace being broken. 

Thank you for your time.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I can't keep doing these cycles of sobriety, some control, then binging again. I keep risking everything I love and want, but no matter what, I just can't get the thought of drinking out of my head. It's my crutch - even on good days.

"WITHOUT RESERVATION

When brimming with gratitude, one's heartbeat must surely result in outgoing love...

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 37

While practicing service to others, if my successes give rise to grandiosity, I must reflect on what brought me to this point.  What has been given joyfully, with love, must be passed on without reservation and without expectation.  For as I grow, I find that no matter how much I give with love, I receive much more in spirit.

I‚Äôve been sober for one year and nine months. I was offered store-bought tiramisu today and didn‚Äôt think to ask about the label. It has 0.27% alcohol and I had about a quarter cup. I feel sick knowing I ate it. Does this ruin my sobriety?,alcoholicsanonymous
"I started going to AA, wont go into the hardships ive endured because of my addiction to alcohol because you probably already know that story. However, ive been noticing a very common theme at any AA meeting, sponsor or any one at any meeting  THC= bad bad stuff, i mean worse than alcohol, like devils lettuce, youre going to hell if you smoke this stuff. 
Im not bashing AA by any means because it helps people stop drinking and that is profound, astonishing, spiritual, i mean heavy stuff. But cannot bare another word about how THC in any form is going to put me in a drunken coffin.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Let me start by saying I don‚Äôt drink that much. Maybe six beers per night. I mean it‚Äôs a lot, but I don‚Äôt get wasted, and I never drink liquor, can‚Äôt stand it. I just drink ti sind down after a long day of work. The problem is, I pretty much need it to enjoy anything. I literally can‚Äôt enjoy a movie unless I‚Äôm drunk. I have zero attention span and I‚Äôll get no endorphin rise out of it. I get bored instantly. There isn‚Äôt one movie out there that can excite me while sober. But when I have a good buzz going, I enjoy everything, I‚Äôm like a little kid. Same thing with videogames ,I can‚Äôt play a game unless I‚Äôm drunk. Drinking makes me focused, it gets me to a calm state with no worries, where I can just chill and enjoy whatever.

I wanna stop drinking, but every time I stop, nothing is fun anymore. I have no desire to do anything. Can my brain go back to normal? I‚Äôve quit for months and it didn‚Äôt help. I just became depressed because nothing excited me anymore.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi all. 

I‚Äôm a 26 year old woman and just had my first child in May. I remained sober my entire pregnancy for my son‚Äôs health but since giving birth, I‚Äôve fallen right back into regular drinking. I‚Äôm a highly functional drunk, I‚Äôm capable of doing everything normally, speaking normally, and I never allow myself to breastfeed after more than the recommended limit of 1-2 glasses of wine. But once I breastfeed, I down a few more drinks to make the most of that time before I have to sober up again. (I do not endanger my son‚Ä¶ for the most part, we bottle feed him). 

A few important notes: 

I and my husband both were raised by alcoholic mothers. I cared for my mother in my teenage years while she scream-cried for hours and pulled knives on me, slurred and stumbled, etc. My father gave up helping her, they separated and I was her caretaker. Then it was my baby brother when I left. She considers herself ‚Äúwell‚Äù now. And while she is happy and I enjoy being around her again, she very much is still a heavy drinker. 

I have attempted to quit before and I always manage to justify not continuing my streak. Usually it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only drink on the weekends‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll drink as much water as alcohol‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll only drink the seven drinks max limit‚Äù, etc. 

I am on heavy-ish medication. An anti-anxiety, an anti-depressant, and a beta blocker. 

I ALWAYS end up hating myself in the midst of drinking. Every. Fucking. Time. I get so pissed that I let myself drink as much as I did. Then once the headache goes away and I sleep it off, I manage to justify it all over again the next night. 

I saw a therapist for 5 years and she repeatedly told me she did not believe I had a problem, even though I regularly brought it up. She thinks I only feel out of control because I‚Äôm so scared to become my mother. 

But I never want to put my son through what I went through. I want to live a long, healthy life. Frankly, I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôve somehow already fucked up my body. 

I guess my question is this: how do you start, and HOW do you keep committed? I can‚Äôt seem to make quitting stick.",alcoholicsanonymous

"A year ago today, I checked myself into the hospital for suicidal thoughts and plans. It was after a night of binge drinking, I remember that. I had never felt so hopeless in my entire life. I had no idea I was adding fuel to the fire by binge drinking. 

This year, I ""reclaimed"" the day by making it fun and special. I woke up and took my family to the Mackinac Bridge and then we spent some time in the U.P. We listened to music, laughed till we cried, and tried new things. 

Ive come so far and its literally all because I gave up alcohol.

"I‚Äôve been drinking every day since 2008. Sometimes a 6 pack, some times way more. I‚Äôve heard stories about people suffering trauma after going cold turkey. What‚Äôs the best way to start and detox? I have a supportive family but at the same time I don‚Äôt. (When it comes to alcohol). Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to drink at all. I still do. Can I just step up and cut it out without having issues. I still have a good memory and my functions are still there.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Not related, but I sobered up 11 years ago today.  I stayed sober for almost 8 years. I never got around  to being fully independent in that time, then I definitely wasn't independent after I relapsed.  I'm sober 10 months now, I know I don't want want to drink or get high, but I have no faith in my ability to work, socialize healthily, and stay focused on my goals enough to make healthy progress.

I'm particularly triggered lately because I'm thinking I need to rehome my dog. Every time I have gone to rehab, the hospital, or left town to help dying family, I have no one who can take proper care of him and I don't really know any services that are trustworthy. 

I get confused, frustrated, scared and sad whenever I think about anything like getting a job, having an apartment of my own, or trying to keep the program first.  I get depressive and anxious, meds take away most of my ability to enjoy my life, and I just don't want to live in this shitty circumstance anymore.  I haven't attempted suicide in a long time, which I guess is progress, but I have relapsed a couple times trying to get back into the program because I can't think about anything other than not wanting to deal with life.

My AA home group are awesome, I love them and they love me, but when any pressure comes my way and I become anxious or depressive, they are quick to point me towards therapy.  Therapy really doesn't seem to be helpful at all. I can't help but think that I'm just lying to myself about the success of the program. I just feel like pretending I'm alright, having some small victories that make other people think I'm better, and ignoring everything I feel and think to just outsource my purpose is all I'm doing.  Where is the happy joyous and free life I've been promised? How does it slip away so frequently?

I'm just not grateful right now. I try to be of service to get out of myself, but ultimately I'm not supporting myself. I'm get scared and confused when I think about what I need to do to be self sufficient.

This is just sad and pathetic.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi. I work at a bar, and have been trying so hard to become a bartender, which makes this all the more difficult.

Over quarantine there wasn‚Äôt a day I didn‚Äôt drink. It would start as 3 drinks a day, but quickly escalated to 7 or more. This went on for the entire duration of quarantine. All 14 months.

When I went back to work, I calmed down a bit. Could stop for days. Even weeks. But when I give myself the green light, I binge. Easily hitting a combination of strong drinks and beers. The kind doesn‚Äôt matter; I like it all.

Binging seems to be the big problem. I‚Äôll go fast and black out. Wake up the next day not knowing what happened and soaked in whatever evacuation my body chooses to execute.

If I‚Äôm at the bar, I find a group of people and mingle and binge. I love socializing and it‚Äôs difficult to find a place like a bar to get that kind of social interaction. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I love drinking so much; the connection to others that it kinda allows.

My boyfriend (26m) and I (32f) have been in a serious relationship for almost 2 years. We began dating 6 months before the pandemic which were super intense and tumultuous because of loosing roommates and 2 jobs. So he moved in to help me and we were pretty inseparable. Everything was great with us until I started noticing he lacked control with alcohol. I didn‚Äôt say anything at first but it became daily during the pandemic that I had to check myself because I was gaining weight from it. He has gotten so drunk that he has peed on the couch and our bed while passed out. Those were the biggest red flags and it was unbelievable at first. He has gotten into the habit of drinking so much when he goes back to his hometown about 40 miles away with his friend that he doesn‚Äôt come back until the next day. I hate this so much and I told him I couldn‚Äôt take it so we discussed taking a break two weeks ago. It was very emotional and he refuses to admit there is a problem. I started asking him to consider aa or therapy. He mentioned him and his friend going to AA ONCE and now denies that it is for him. He thinks I am trying to control him. Last night was his birthday and he was suppose to meet me after my class and go to dinner together. But he got too drunk and stayed where he was. He bailed on our plans. I don‚Äôt know what to do or say anymore because it appears he will only understand us breaking up and me leaving him.,alcoholicsanonymous

Hi everyone. I wanted to create this account and join this community to connect with others on the same journey as myself. Sorry that it‚Äôs kind of long. 
        I‚Äôve been struggling with alcohol addiction for the better part of 15 years. I‚Äôm 30 now. It originally started as a way to cope with being bullied in school, body shaming, childhood trauma, physical/mental abuse at home and from a teacher, rape, being taken by DCYF due to skipping school, and just never quite fitting in no matter how hard I tried. I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I ended up staying back in school for two years and dropped out in the 8th grade as soon as I turned 16. I kept most of these issues bottled up and picked up smoking cigarettes, self harm, drinking and smoking pot with my few friends who were also ‚Äúoutcasts.‚Äù I finally felt like I belonged since we all did the same thing to numb the pain.  
       When I turned 17, I got a fake ID and started dancing to make enough to move out of my abusive home. I got my own place and thought I was queen of the world. Well, unfortunately that job just glorified drinking and drugging and sent me down an even worse path. I stopped self harm and smoking pot/cigarette but the drinking got much worse as it was just handed to me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd pound down shots and put myself in risky situations.. But the money was incredible and since all my peers were doing it and my employer encouraged it, I felt like I belonged. I knew it was getting into a problem when even they fired me for getting too drunk‚Ä¶ I lost friends who were ‚Äúparty people‚Äù themselves. Cause I just couldn‚Äôt hold my liquor cause I was all or nothing. Having an eating disorder while drinking probably didn‚Äôt help. 
Anyways, this went on for years. I traveled to get away and any time anyone called me out on being a sloppy drunk, I got defensive and figured they were the problem. I felt like the whole world was against me. That they were the problem. When in reality, if you think everyone around you has a problem, you‚Äôre more than likely THE problem yourself. The only people I clicked with were those who would enable me and laugh when I got drunk but still hang out again. The ones who wouldn‚Äôt judge me and would feed my addiction.
I got so bad that I‚Äôd go out on dates just so someone could buy me drinks and get me drunk‚Ä¶ Even if I just ‚ÄúIrish goodbyed‚Äù them after.  I‚Äôve been hospitalized many times from passing out at bars or in public.. But I wouldn‚Äôt say it was cause I got drunk. I‚Äôd insist that I didn‚Äôt drink that much and that somebody must‚Äôve drugged my drink. I lied despite knowing the truth even when I was pronounced dead for 20 seconds. 
Nothing stopped me‚Ä¶ I thought I was so sly hiding bottles, burying cans under the trash so it would look like I drank less. Thinking I was holding my composure when I was a drunken mess‚Ä¶ 
After all of this, I still never thought my problem was a problem. Last year I attended my first AA meeting. But I compared instead of identified. I didn‚Äôt take it seriously and despite staying sober for 2 months, as soon as my bday came around I thought I was cured and that I can just have one or two and be fine. What a joke that was. Sure the first few times I was able to but then I was like well if I can have two then I can probably have 3 and be fine too. Ha. 
It got worse and worse. I denied having a problem cause it wasn‚Äôt daily. I‚Äôd just binge about twice per week. My poor fianc√© would come home from work and see me a drunken mess. 
But something hit me and hit me hard like a ton of bricks about a week ago. If I don‚Äôt get help, I‚Äôm going to die alone. He‚Äôs going to leave me. I‚Äôll be stuck in this toxic cycle. And I cried for days thinking about it. Almost got suicidal. But then something told me I can‚Äôt give up. I can‚Äôt lose faith. That I am a great person when I don‚Äôt abuse alcohol. That I need help. 
That is when I swore on everything that I WILL (not just try) quit. I want to feel alive and have a purpose. I want a bright future. To have a family. A happy home. Instead of building a life like the one I grew up with and around. I deserve better. My family deserves better (even if they tried to enable me), and my fianc√© deserves better. 
I‚Äôve been attending zoom meets daily as well as in person meets. I met a friend at AA who takes me to live meetings daily and is as eager about sobriety and helps encourage me. I try to speak at every meeting to get over the mental block and thought that I NEED alcohol for people to accept me and to talk to others. I got two chips that I carry everywhere as a reminder. I quit my bar tending job to avoid sabotage, keep a journal that I write in twice per day, I keep positive messages around the house, meditate and have been practicing mindfulness. I even went out with a group of people from AA to dinner yesterday. For the first time, the voice in the back of my head that tells me to drink was nowhere to be found. It was amazing. To be able to smile, laugh, talk freely and be myself without using alcohol as a crutch like I did for 15 years‚Ä¶.. I know it‚Äôs just the beginning but I feel blessed.. I feel like I‚Äôm on a path to finally break free from everything I once knew. I‚Äôll finally be able to grow and create a beautiful life‚Ä¶. 

If you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read my story. Sharing this so openly was tough but I feel relieved and maybe my story will help someone else. Recovery is possible. Whether you are on day 1 or year 10, you got this and are doing amazing. Thank you.",alcoholicsanonymous
"OUR CHILDREN

The alcoholic may find it hard to re-establish friendly relations with his children... In time they will see that he is a new man and in their own way they will let him know it... From that point on, progress will be rapid.  Marvelous results often follow such a reunion.

While on the road to recovery I received a gift that could not be purchased.  It was a card from my son in college, saying, 'Dad, you can't imagine how glad I am that everything is okay.  Happy Birthday, I love you.'  My son had told me that he loved me before.  It had been during the previous Christmas holidays, when he had said to me, while crying, 'Dad, I love you!  Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?'  I couldn't.  Choked with emotion, I had cried, but this time, when I received my son's card, my tears were tears of joy, not desperation.

"Flew to across the country to make amends to my ex wife. In the 15 years we were together I took everything I could from her to gratify myself and make me feel better about myself. No matter how much she gave, I wanted more. I took until she had barely anything left to give and that's when I really turned up the pressure to squeeze more out, and when she was finally totally empty, I abandoned her went and took some from my neighbor. My selfishness was bottomless.

Thank God for AA.

The amends is an opportunity for us to give to those from whom we have taken, for their sake! We come to this program powerless, meaning we had been relying on the delusion of personal power that we don't really have. No matter how hard we tried to exert personal power to manage our lives, we always ended up in the same place -- desperate and drunk with a path of wreckage behind us.

When we work this program of recovery with diligence, we get connected (or reconnected) to a higher power that fills us up and guides us, if we let it. I am very grateful that my higher power gave me words of truth to speak and filled me with love, compassion, understanding, and most importantly faith -- all of which I was able to give to my ex wife without the expectation of getting anything in return. That is a miracle.

"Asking for a friend:

Friend (m39) has been drinking (not at alcoholic levels) since he was about 17. 

He was going through some personal things and spent the last 13 months drinking heavily and likely is an alcoholic. 

Drinking at 6:00 am until he passed out, waking up and drinking some more, and never skipping a day.

Mostly vodka. Between .75 and 1.25 pints per day on single drinking days, and about double that on days he would drink, sleep, then drink some more.

He was hiding it from his wife (or so he thought), and she finally confronted him a couple weeks ago. 

He knew she was right about him likely being an alcoholic, and he knew she was right about how it was affecting their relationship, his work, etc, so he quit cold turkey that day. 

It‚Äôs been two weeks. But here‚Äôs the thing, he feels fine. In fact he feels pretty damn great! If he went through withdrawals, they were minimal and short lived. And he doesn‚Äôt even crave it. He‚Äôs around other people drinking and will even cook with beer and wine still. 

I am certain he has not relapsed and hidden it (trust me) and I believe he feels the way he says he feels. 

So, if he could go from drinking the amount he did to not drinking at all, overnight, and without withdrawals or even cravings, do you think he‚Äôs really an alcoholic, or could he maybe have just settled into a shitty routine for the last year+ and simply needed to be snapped out of it?

Also, as I said, he feels great. He gained a lot of weight over the last year and was basically either drunk or hungover all the time. He has complained of stomach/abdomen discomfort and of feeling generally bad in the past, but he barely ate, barely slept, and drank liquor every day, so feeling like ass with stomach pains doesn‚Äôt sound too unusual, but he was a little concerned he may have done serious damage to his internal organs. 

Two weeks later though, and all the pain is gone and his appetite is back and he basically seems to be like he was 13 months ago only about 20 lbs heavier. 

Do you think he could have internal organ damage? 

He doesn‚Äôt like going to the doctor. 

Thanks!

TLDR: friend seemed to be a bad alcoholic for the last 13 months and then quit cold turkey. He seems completely fine. No withdrawal/cravings, and he feels great. 

Is he an alcoholic, and might he still have internal organs damage?",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hello, Maureen, I‚Äôm an alcoholic 

I really need some recommendations. Please scroll to the bottom if you don‚Äôt want to read my story. Thank you!

38 years old. I‚Äôve been a heavy drinker for about 19 years. Two years ago I wound up in the hospital with double vision, no balance. I couldn‚Äôt walk, no alcohol in my system. I went through the all the tests (CT, ultrasound, EKG, etc.) Long story short, I was ‚Äúseverely malnourished,‚Äù my liver is in bad shape, and Wernicke-Korsicoff. 

Doctors said my inability to walk, due to brain damage, without assistance would likely be permanent. They released me after three days with a regimen  of supplements (thiamine, potassium, folic acid, and magnesium) and a $20k bill. 

I‚Äôve been sober off and on since, but also felt like what‚Äôs the point. My vision is fine but my balance never came back. My speech is slurred which is ironically hilarious since I‚Äôm sober. I shake worse than I ever did during the worst withdrawals. I eat now, which is a change. I take supplements. But, I have failed to ever follow up since my hospital stay. I realize that should be my obvious first step. It‚Äôs to the point now where the tremors are so bad it‚Äôs difficult to eat, after three (new) months sober. (Stirring food/getting it to my mouth, picking up a cup.) I know going to a doctor is the obvious next step, same as it was 2 years ago after I was released from the hospital. I‚Äôve scheduled and cancelled and feel frozen. Idk what im so afraid of; it certainly is not dying.

Does anyone have any recommendations for facilities that can help, not just with the addiction, but the health stuff? Maybe they all do, I have no idea. I barely sleep due to neuropathy, mostly in my feet, anxiety, depression, lack of alcohol. I can barely walk due to joint and nerve pain and lack of movement (work from home now.) The tremors, after months of sobriety, are so bad I can hardly use utensils to eat.

Any help is appreciated. I‚Äôve been to some meetings but all zoom bc of Covid and lack of mobility. I‚Äôve gained inspiration but never made an actual connection because since the hospital, I had to move to a new city to have help. I only know my best friend who helps with me and my dog‚Ä¶ but she is an alcoholic too. 

Thank you all so much, and I look up to each and every one of you. If anyone wants to privately message me, I‚Äôd welcome that too. Very long story short. Looking for rehab that can address handicap/possible recovery from a bad prognosis caused by years of heavy abuse. Stay strong and thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è",alcoholicsanonymous

"mostly rambling but im still connecting things... 

my brother moved in with my wife and i when we got out of his second visit to rehab. he is 30, and very smart, shy but funny when we is in a good mood. it was really good, until it  wasnt. i guess the freedom that our house allowed with us all working let him slip up. this wasnt a huge deal at first. we got home from work and realized what had happened, we were not tooooo suprised but sad. we took his alcohol. i took the next day off of work so we could talk about things and set some more defined  boundaries. we chatted but wanted to wait until my wife got home, i took what stuff i could find from his room, and we went back to bed to rest from the day before. 

I was in the house and  he continued to drink. i guess he snuck out while i slept or something... i was just one room over and he wasnt able to step out and say anything. this is tearing me up. i know shame must be rooted to his core, believing he is disappointing us. and now i feel like it is my fault for trusting him in his room alone. my wife is throwing some shade.

he is back in rehab, thank god, but i am scared for him. if one of his only friends is just one room over and is unable to do anything how will he ever get out of this. it is getting so bad im scared that if he cannot reach out to me, or anyone, he will end up drinking himself to death. my parents told me some stories about how bad it can get for him and i feel like this is how it is going to end.

they tried setting hard boundaries but he ends up sneaking out and drinking during the night, or driving around, or just running away.

"I am going downhill. After a night of binge drinking with a coworker the next day I felt very odd.

Two is that I‚Äôm having to even ask this question. Also I know I‚Äôm on probation for a dui and I‚Äôm still drinking every other weekend. Almost like how my ex used to. And I saw him get to the point where we had to divorce. Based on everyone‚Äôs experience do you know these to be symptoms of binge drinking?

"I went to detox for the first time 2 weeks ago and I wrote this reflection today. I didn‚Äôt expect things to magically turn around and to be singing coombia but I haven‚Äôt really felt any good changes yet. I didn‚Äôt know where else to post this and if I am alone feeling this way.

When you stop drinking,

People close to you will say things like, ‚ÄúI am proud of you‚Äù, ‚Äúit takes courage and strength to admit you have a problem and to do something about it‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre still friends, we‚Äôll still invite you to stuff and we‚Äôll figure out stuff to do‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôll feel better soon, it gets better‚Äù ‚Äúno shame in getting help‚Äù

It feels like bullshit. You feel alone, you feel left out. You feel like everyone you know now treats you different. The fun is gone and those closest to you will tell you to replace that void with lame shit, like cleaning or walking around aimlessly. ‚ÄúFind a new hobby‚Äù- well guess what all the things you used to do for fun, like golf, watching the big game, meeting up with friends, you can‚Äôt really do anymore because drinking was usually involved and now it just seems like a piece of it is missing. 

The boredom is bad, watching movies you‚Äôve already seen just to pass the time. Going to bed early because you don‚Äôt know what else to do. I‚Äôve never been one to claim the world resolves around me because it certainly doesn‚Äôt. All your friends will be nice to your face and say that they support you, but really that is to make themselves feel good. They all still go out (and I don‚Äôt blame them) and tell you all about their fun weekend trips, going to the new brewery, nights out and adventures come Monday morning and then realize ‚Äúoh shit he probably doesn‚Äôt want to hear this and then just awkwardly look at their shoes without even you having to say anything. 

Your family, girlfriend, friends, doctor, social worker, coworkers anyone who knows will instinctively look at you different. Some because they actually care and some because they don‚Äôt know what else to do. You will lose friends, and it will all happen all at once. All you want is to go back the way it was but it can never truly go back even if you go ahead and pick up the bottle just to numb the pain.

It seems to get worse with every new person you have to tell ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go out tonight‚Äù for no good reason and you feel like some outcast, to people who know you the best. You end up sitting around playing with legos and building Star Wars models like an 8 year old because you don‚Äôt want to be the son that joins the 27 club.

"FIRST THINGS FIRST

Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn this truth: Job or no job ‚Äì wife or no wife ‚Äì we simply do not stop drinking so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence on God.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 98

Before coming to A.A., I always had excuses for taking a drink: 'She said...', 'He said...', 'I got fired yesterday', 'I got a great job today'.  No area of my life could be good if I drank again.  In sobriety my life gets better each day.  I must always remember not to drink, to trust God, and to stay active in A.A.  Am I putting anything before my sobriety, God, and A.A. today?

"I went out for a long bike ride on what was the first real day of fall here. Riding through the park and the surrounding neighborhoods, marveling at the live oaks, I thought back to my early struggles with this whole God/Higher Power business.

The live oaks are magnificent. Each one entirely unique in composition, but within a family. There is one little section in the park with about a dozen trees and there is very clearly a grandpa live oak, a grandma live oak and all their children and grandchildren.

There is something about them that is awe-inspiring in a quiet way.

When I washed into AA, I had a lot of very fancy ideas and complicated beliefs about God, religion, theology, spirituality and all that biz. It all rolled around in my head, generally keeping me agitated and confused.

The book says *‚ÄúWe found that as soon as we were able to* ***lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe*** *in a power greater than ourselves, we commenced to get results, even though it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that power, which is God.""*

*‚Äúlay aside prejudice‚Äù.*  You mean, put down what *I think I know* about God, religion, theology, spirituality and all that biz? Admit that I don‚Äôt have all the answers?

*‚Äúa willingness to believe‚Äù.*  Maybe *try something different for a change*? I mean, my best thinking and selfish actions are what landed me here in the first place.

And as I was riding, it hit me: I can‚Äôt make a live oak. I can plant a seed or sapling, water it, nurture it, protect it and watch it grow, but I‚Äôm not responsible for what brings a live oak to life. That power is beyond me. 

That is a humbling epiphany. 

Today, I don‚Äôt know anything about God, and I have realized that for me, wherever my higher power resides or whatever it really is, isn‚Äôt important. It simply doesn‚Äôt matter. 

I have come to believe through my lived experience that my higher power doesn‚Äôt care about who I believe in, how I think, or what my feelings on the subject are, but it does care very much about my actions - how I treat myself and others.

For the AA program to succeed in my life, I don‚Äôt have to subscribe to any other‚Äôs view of God, religion, theology, spirituality and all that biz. My own conception is sufficient.

I‚Äôm pretty grateful for that.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I'm desperately seeking some AA help to deal with this.

I'm almost two years sober and currently working step 9 with my sponsor.

Things have been very hard yet progressing in the right direction, being that I went from helpless and homeless to renting my own studio apartment. My change in thinking thanks to AA allowed this to happen.

However, I recently scored a position in my old career which required me to move interstate.

I thought I'd be okay. However, I found the process of moving so traumatic that I feel like I'm a completely different person now on a completely different planet. I'm scared of everything and can see or feel no joy or hope anywhere.

I'm currently staying with a family member before I'm allowed to fly interstate, and I'm struggling so damn hard to stay alive.

I'm not ever sure how I could possibly start my new job when I'm this damn frightened.

" I had an amazing week because I didn't drink this week. Why you may ask? Because I was struck utmost myself from what I did last Friday that it was simply easy. Last Friday I drank from 5 pm to 8 pm Saturday -- yes that's right. And now after all that progress it has lured me back in. It is 2:40 am where I am and I don't feel myself ever wanting to stop. I had a great day because of my sober week. I did a lot of my work, studied, and even got a new tattoo. Now though at 2:40 I just want to take my electric bike out and ride around. 

Meanwhile my wife is in the other room sleeping hoping to God I can just keep it together for once. I promised her I'd turn it all around once we got married and bought this house... But yet here I am, it seems as thing get better I just thrive off it and take it into my own selfish labyrinth of drinking myself into a false state but yet continually stuck in the mode that I desperately starve for. Despite my goals and how I want things to be I always rock into this mode. I'm an engineer and have dozens of ideas that investors would fight over but yet I'd rather drown in my own pity. But then again I guess that is what happens when you grew up as someone everyone expected to be in prison. My mother was bipolar and God knows I feel the mania and Satan knows I feel the depression because it has nearly taken my life. 

In a nutshell I'm the type of drinker that when I start I can't stop. I can't stop so badly that I don't ever even go to sleep because I drink beer. I'll stay up 48 hrs. drinking on the weekend without sleep just drinking. I seem to just ride a high like a bipolar person on a manic trip. But yet 3 or 4 of the days of the week I'm cool and happy not drinking. But normally that is all because I'm still ruminating on how my last drunk totally kicked my ass. It just seems to me that this drink puts a spell over me and I can't get over it, I just can't beat the damn thing, no matter how fucking hard I try I just keep trying and trying. I know I'll quit when I have to but damn it is really kicking the shit out of me. 

My father was an alcoholic and it lead/contributed in my parents divorce when I was 13. Later on when I was 18 he died. He buried himself in a studio apartment after the divorce drinking himself to death with a strange hint of pride. I live in that apartment with him when my mom kicked me out at 16. My grandfather died at a local bar, he was a local and had a heart attack at 56 one night. My dad's brother (my uncle John) died drinking Listerine, my uncle Bill (my dads brother too) was a wild drunk but an awesome man. Bill ended up dying of all kinds of health complications. My half brother Tony died of a heroine overdose last year at 34. My cousin Eric died this year and was a meth addict. 

Sure that might be me feeling sorry for myself? But it is my fucking reality. I don't know where to turn. I'm a strong and established 27 year old man but both parents are dead, all grandparents, siblings live out of state, and I don't even wat to think of that as an excuse. I'd just rather drink.",alcoholicsanonymous

It's been years since I last spoke to anyone but recently I was made aware by my mother of my uncle's true feelings towards me. The worst part is that I didn't feel anything when I heard what he had to say. How could he call me an alcoholic when his own alcoholism resulted in prison time and a scar across his face from a drunk driving incident. My only emotion is feeling numb and the desire to place the ultimate distance possible between myself and the rest of my family by just blocking everyone. I was always outcasted by them before so why would now be any different? They don't know how deeply I crave to live a sober life. I'd give anything to have a normal brain that wasn't wired to numb the pain each time it seeps in.

I also dislike how some meetings are so limited to sharing only of alcoholism. I honestly feel that we struggle with so many other co-morbidities that to limit this can make newcomers feel rejected or shunned if they do not yet identify as an alcoholic (through the spiritual definition).

We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again: 'Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.'  Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever.  If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.

Fast forward to when I was 18/19 years old I had got out of high school and had gone through a trade school, I started working in my profession and I remember I was going through a bit of a rough patch mentally, I was just miserable, I was severely depressed and I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch to get me through and as time had progressed I never really noticed how far I getting into it before I was drinking every night, I would drink bourbon in my room by myself every night whether I had to wake up for work at 5am or not. And not only did the frequency of my drinking increase but so did my depression, I had gotten to the point that I just didn‚Äôt want to be alive anymore. I felt like I had nothing to lose and had completely accepted defeat and was embracing my alcoholism. Not only was I drinking every night but I had also began skipping work to get drunk, I would leave work early to go home and drink. I would drive to work drunk. I was hell bent on staying mentally absent. I began taking whatever people would offer. I‚Äôd smoke weed, I would drink lean, someone would give me adderall at work here and there. It had gotten to a point where I was in so much trouble with my job because of my spotty attendance that one night I decided that I needed to get better so I broke the news to my family they were supportive, they gave me help. I was seeing a psychologist and an addiction specialist, the psychologist wrote me some prescriptions for my depression and anxiety and that‚Äôs when I fell head over heels for Xanax. I began abusing those and to skip ahead, at my worst I was going through 60 pills in about two weeks time. I made it through, I got myself out of it. What got me out of it was the fact that I wanted to. You guys can do this and I believe in every one of you that you are capable. Get the help you need. Use your family and friends as your motivators, god bless you guys",alcoholicsanonymous
"I always had an issue with not being able to stop. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll have a couple because it never is. 
I managed to go 3 months sober which I am very proud of myself for doing. I went to the gym lost 3 stone, defeated a lot of anxiety, met the love of my life now we‚Äôre together.
But September has been a month of party‚Äôs and events. So I‚Äôve been using that as an excuse but I know inside I‚Äôm going over board all the time. And I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be able to stop. I‚Äôve got one more party tomorrow. And then plan to stop. But I feel like I‚Äôm just lying to myself. Anyway just wanted to put some thoughts out there",alcoholicsanonymous

I feel humiliated. Both of my parents are alcoholics and both nearly died from their addiction. My mom got sober right before I was born and got her masters degree and LSW and specializes in helping those with additions. I just feel like such a failure and don‚Äôt want to tell anyone, especially my mom and dad. I‚Äôm only on their health insurance for another year so I feel like my time is running out. I need help",alcoholicsanonymous
"It's so crazy typing this right now because just 24 hours ago, I didn't know how I could continue attending AA when I cannot stand the meetings.
One of the older ladies from yesterdays meeting grabbed my number to invite me to a meeting today. After the meeting, I'm talking to the girl who sat next to me and then we get invited to dinner after with some people she had just met yesterday. Now I'm at dinner with 20 other people from the young peoples group in my area. 
My experience in aa has been very cliquey. I know I'm not the only one who has seen this in the rooms. But since being back these last 2 days, I've experienced the literal opposite. Strangers, mainly women, have taken my number down and called me, invited me to dinner, adding me to group chats, etc. Now I have plans for the next two days to go out with them to meetings and to fellowship. I'm invited into their houses like i'm not a stranger at all. 

After the meeting, I was driving to the restaurant to meet them and started crying because idk how I got so fucking lucky. its like god knew exactly what I needed when I needed it and is providing that and more. I didnt understand why certain things happened the way they did (the guy im dating moving, my relapse, friendships ending) but now I see it. There's no way I could have done this myself. Every event led to the next, which is what got me here, where I need to be. 

AHHHH IM SO EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW 

I hope someday I can repay this kindness that has so freely been shown to me in the rooms of AA",alcoholicsanonymous

"i really don‚Äôt know how to start this message, all i know is i need help desperately and i think this is the right community to be in. 

i have a problem with alcohol. a very unhealthy relationship. i don‚Äôt believe i‚Äôm a full blown alcoholic but i‚Äôve absolutely been abusing it recently and i know i need to stop. i was raped a few months ago and i have horrible anxiety and debilitating ptsd and i‚Äôve been using alcohol as a crutch to get me through these dark times. i‚Äôve come to realize it‚Äôs only made things worse and i need to face reality. i literally woke up in a puddle of my own vomit two nights ago and all i have been able to think about since then is how i‚Äôm lucky to fucking be alive right now. i‚Äôve never been this scared in my life. 

i think moving forward the obvious decision would be to go to aa meetings and follow the steps. 

i guess what i‚Äôm asking is, how did you work up the courage to go to your first aa meeting? how did you admit out loud to your friends and family you have a problem? i‚Äôm so scared to disappoint my loved ones but i‚Äôm really struggling and i need to have control over my life again.",alcoholicsanonymous
My father is on my resentment list for a multitude of things from my childhood. I endured physical emotional and sexual abuse from him when I was very young. He died around when I was 10 so I never achieved the maturity to see his wrongs clearly or gain the strength to expose those things until much later in life when I became a father. I don't know how to put into words or even comprehend that I had something to do with that or if I shoulder any of the blame for them. Any advice would be much appreciated.,alcoholicsanonymous
"I've read through this page a lot and all of you guys are so amazing and I thought it might be the time I say something since I don't really have many people I am comfortable talking to. I am a 21-year-old female and I started really drinking as the pandemic hit in early 2020. I was never really a drinker until all the stress of covid and now I find myself drinking every night alone. I used to be a very social person and now I just feel like I've lost touch with myself, to be honest. I often have nights where I just feel horrible and cry and call my friends at about 3 am (they obviously don't answer) and I wake up embarrassed and it's getting to be a lot and I'm running out of excuses. I've also gained a lot of weight due to drinking and I really want to stop and be happy again. I know you guys suggest AA but I am embarrassed I might see someone I know or leave due to the anxiety of me having to admit my problem. I have so many questions about how AA is and what it consists of. If anyone can give me some advice I would love that.

I'm curious to know your thoughts on taking ceremonial ayahuasca if approved by a doctor? The intention would be not to get high or loaded but to explore some inner trauma.

I did some reading with a guy but I didn't feel a connection to him really and it just didn't feel right.  I've got step one but damn I just can't really get passed it everyone keeps saying I have to pray but I try and I just don't feel it.

"'I WAS AN EXCEPTION'

He [Bill W.] said to me, gently and simply, 'Do you think that you are one of us?'

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 413 (Third Edition)

During my drinking life I was convinced I was an exception.  I thought I was beyond petty requirements and had the right to be excused.  I never realized that the dark counterbalance of my attitude was the constant feeling that I did not 'belong.'  At first, in A.A., I identified with others only as an alcoholic.  What a wonderful awakening for me it has been to realize that, if human beings were doing the best they could, then so was I!  All of the pains, confusions and joys they feel are not exceptional, but part of my life, just as much as anybody's.

"2 years ago I hated alcohol, even when I got it as a gift I wouldn‚Äôt touch it because I just didn‚Äôt like the taste or the buzz. Now I‚Äôve been drinking daily for almost a year, last summer I was literally puking every night and I would chug a sip of vodka before going to bed even tho I was already drunk. Countless nights that I can‚Äôt remember. I can say, I‚Äôve slowed down now and don‚Äôt feel like I need to be blacked out before bed but I still drink daily. I keep telling me spouse that we need to quit drinking and that I am tired of being an alcoholic but my spouse just says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a drinking problem, literally every adult drinks everyday‚Äù. Sorry buddy but I was an adult 2 years ago and I didn‚Äôt drink everyday and I was quite happy and also NO not every adult drinks every day. I don‚Äôt understand the thought process? Why can I clearly see the problem and my spouse can not? 
Also my spouse will deny being hammered when it‚Äôs kind of obvious on nights when I am drinking less.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I found out this evening that a dear AA friend's spouse has relapsed. My friend was so upset and confused. They are going to Al Anon starting tomorrow.

Early on in my program someone shared at a meeting a similar situation with their spouse except they had young children too.

I'm marrying another AA. We each work our own program and have our own homegroup. We support each other and cheer each other on. It's a pretty awesome partnership, hence the upcoming nuptials.

My anxiety goes through the roof when I hear stories of relapse in relationship. I'm afraid of my partner relapsing. I'm afraid I'll be the one to relapse some day. I'm afraid whomever doesn't relapse will have to suffer the consequences. I'm afraid to have children because of who we were and who we might become again.

What is it like having long-term sobriety with a partner? How do you protect your own sobriety when a partner relapses? what about the children? I know there is no certainty, and that seems to be where my problem lies. 

It's midnight so I'll talk to my sponsor about this tomorrow. Any wisdom is appreciated.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I‚Äôll be sober one year in four days. 

I should be happy. 

But this isn‚Äôt my first time around - I had almost a year once before and then relapsed, and I was out for six years. During those six years I did irreparable damage to my marriage and children. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm sober now, but I am struggling to come to terms with the fact that I lost so much time with my children - who are just about grown now - and the fact that I hurt my husband so badly he wants to leave me now. 

Ive gone through the steps with a good sponsor. I‚Äôve done my best to make amends but there are some things that can‚Äôt be fixed. I can never make it up to my children that they grew up in an alcoholic home with an alcoholic mother. My husband can never unhear the cruel things I said to him while drunk. I‚Äôve just done too much damage to my marriage that it is no longer reparable and it‚Äôs killing me. 

I feel like an unloveable monster. Im not a monster - I know that. The things I did were all pretty run of the mill alcoholic stuff - I threw temper tantrums, I said mean things while drunk, I was not present for my kids the way they deserved. I didn‚Äôt hit anyone or be physically abusive (yet). But what I did was enough to kill my marriage and leave my children with lifelong scars. 

On the day of my last drunk my husband said he was done and wanted to divorce. I convinced him to give me six months to show him I was serious. At six months he said he was unsure, so we gave it another six months. Now he says he loves me but he doesn‚Äôt want to live with me anymore. 

This year has been a good one in our marriage. I‚Äôve gotten some emotional sobriety and I don‚Äôt rave and rant anymore, and I can handle disagreement without fighting. We have been kind and loving to each other, and I thought we were going to be okay. But we arent. 

Ive spent 24 years with this man and we‚Äôve raised three children. I thought we‚Äôd be old together. 

I don‚Äôt want to drink, but I kind of want to die.

"So I'm 19 years old , I've had an issue with alcohol since I was 15, I've tried many times to quit and yet when ever I get paid I spend it on booze. A few months ago my caretaker (I have extreme anxiety and can't leave the house without someone else) told me i couldn't buy booze when out with her , I agreed as I know I have an issuie but since then I've taken either ubering booze when my parents aren't home or stealing alcohol from my mum like I did before I was of age to buy it. It's gotten to the point where I've started using household substances to get drunk because I can't stand being sober at times. Note I have bpd and complex ptsd and my addiction started as a way to self medicate at 15 as It was the only thing  to make me feel ok. I am seeing multiple professionals but alcoholism has this type of terrible self blame I can't stand (I have brought it up before buy minimised the issuie) , I've been waiting a year to get a new therapist since I can't do online and lockdown is a bitch. The longest I've been sober is 2 months and that's because I spent any money I got on stupid things. I'm just stuck rn and my lying about drinking has stretched out to anyone important in my life and that makes it harder to get help. Anyway I've been rambling,  I just want to know what i can do now to help as while od love to see a therapist about this I can't
Many thanks

"Just needed some where to vent and since this event made me relapse I figured this is the best place to vent and not be judged delete if I'm wrong ..

I'm a hard working man that works 6 days a week to pay child support and still try to afford to provide for my wife and son...( Haven't seen my other kids in close to 8 months but that's a whole situation) (the current situation that got me to relapse is this) from my current wife I'm always being told that im cheating since I'm working so much (keep in mind I started this job 2 months ago and I'm the only one working.. for the past few months) I was recently kicked out over this being told that im living a 2nd life since I'm working so much ... I broke down ..being human I can only take so much I caved I gave on I wasn't strong enough to keep fight the good fight it won it's been close to a year that I drank and I caved... I'm just lost sorry for the long read and might be pointless but the struggle is all to real ....

Thank u for ur time and for not judging",alcoholicsanonymous
"Idk how to explain it. I used to like aa and now I feel like I‚Äôm listening to a bunch of brainwashed people repeating the same stuff. 6 weeks ago, i started drinking again and I thought it‚Äôd be ok. But now I‚Äôm blacking out again and overall being a shitty human to myself and to others. I can‚Äôt show up the way I want to. 

So I called a couple of my close friends in AA and went to a meeting. I love the fellowship though. I‚Äôm trying to keep an open mind but I literally cringe when I hear people say they have to go to a meeting everyday to stay sober.
I just don‚Äôt want to have to be in aa like that for the rest of my life to remain sober/happy

"I think maybe I have a problem but I‚Äôm having a hard time committing to fixing it. I drink everyday. At least 2-3 drinks, when I try to moderate it‚Äôs always more. Weekends are more of course.

I have these different modes of reliance like A) celebratory ‚Äúyou earned it, it‚Äôs the end of the day!‚Äù B) coping ‚Äúman you‚Äôve had it rough‚Äù C) comfort ‚Äúthis‚Äôll just take the edge off‚Äù and D) boredom ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù.
I don‚Äôt want to completely remove, but I guess I would like to be at a place where I don‚Äôt drink every single day and especially not as coping.

"As said in the title it's become harder as time goes on to really care or commit myself to this program.  Like my mother (who used to only drink) I had my stints with drug and alcohol abuse. I'm 23 now and have went to my moms meetings for some time, but honestly just can't give myself to AA and it's ways completely. I've been sober for a couple months now, not by sheer will and white knuckling it, but because the urge and want to get fucked up has honestly left. I've already been through too much and have no desire to do it all over again. While it is nice and I have stability, I had to move in with my mom and her husband (who also is in AA where they met) until December until I figure out where I am going to move. I've been here at her house for close to a month now and I've been going to meetings to keep her happy. The issue is that I feel like our relationship is now almost rooted in the program. Tonight I said I don't want to go to the meeting she started accusing me of going back to old ways. Again, I'm sober and have left that life and everyone else that came with it behind. And also I am very well aware that I am staying in her home and I have to go by her rules, but there was never any agreement to this. What I'm mostly concerned about is that my mom along with my dad are both under the impression that this is for me, I can't live without it, and if I don't go I'm going to fuck up again. While I think that there assessment is fair to an extent, I also feel like I am unable to really give myself over to this program. Over the last year I have tried, and tried, and tried. I've had sponsors, home groups, did some service work, met some amazing people, but I just can't grasp what keeps everyone walking that walk. I keep being told that I am going to hear something that will just click, but it doesn't happen. When someone speaks I listen and have heard some good stuff, but again nothing is clicking. I feel like I'm going crazy between my parents having been convincing me since I was young that I'm not normal and fucked up and me knowing what's really going on in my head, but trying to appease them while at the same time, trying to apply myself to the program in it's entirety. Fuck man I don't know what to do or who to turn to right now, just really need some advice. If you read all of this, thank you. I just wish that I could get it and get that urge to keep wanting to go back, but it's not there.",alcoholicsanonymous

"This past 18 months, as I‚Äôm sure with a lot of people, has lead me to increase the frequency of drinking alcohol, however after losing a close family member I saw my consumption increase. I‚Äôm still able to function as normal and carry out my day to day, however I know it‚Äôs not good for me.

I‚Äôll not go into detail but after their passing I am now in a position where I am constantly faced with the loss daily, and because of this at times think I haven‚Äôt been able to fully grieve, which I believe is causing me to drink more often.

I wouldn‚Äôt say I anything close to being considered as an alcoholic as I am not doing this everyday, but am aware now that if I don‚Äôt start to cut down it could easily lead to that.

It has been a very challenging time where we live we have been in a strict COVID-19 lockdown for sometime. I live alone and haven‚Äôt been able to see many people. Yesterday there was an Earthquake right in the middle of a suicide prevention course I was doing! A very emotionally challenging time. 

Anyway, there is one passage in Bills Story which has been of particular significance for me in the last 24 hours:

‚ÄúThat when all other measures fail work with another alcoholic would save the day‚Äù

I have been praying a lot for God to remove my fear and direct my attention to what he would have me be and then finding myself looking for ways to work with others and finding that the fear would dissipate.
One way that I like to work with others is reading the big book with them, I am reading the big book with another alcoholic at the moment we read a page at a time and then discussing our findings. Works a treat. 

If you are struggling to find a way out of an emotionally challenging spot then I recommend working with another alcoholic.

"Hi all,

So I have felt for some time I‚Äôve had a problem with alcohol. For years I even joked about it, saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs only beer, real alcoholics drink the strong stuff‚Äù. I‚Äôm realising that I‚Äôve been convincing myself I‚Äôm ok when in fact I‚Äôm not.

I don‚Äôt drink every day‚Ä¶ but probably every other day. I can‚Äôt remember when I started drinking like this but a few years ago I got into some legal trouble and it‚Äôs dragged on and on. My anxiety was and very much is through the roof. Beer just calmed my nerves. 

Skip forward to now and the last few months have been absolute psychological torture. I‚Äôve had to make a phone call every day for 8 weeks to my solicitor to see if I‚Äôm being called to court the next day. I split with my wife. I lost my job. My car is in a state of disrepair and I can‚Äôt afford to fix it. I rarely get to see my 1 year old son. I‚Äôve had to move back in with my parents. Honestly, it‚Äôs a wonder it‚Äôs only alcohol I turned to. Believe me I considered suicide many many times. Even tried but chickened out. I don‚Äôt have the stones for it. Too much of a coward.

But you know what, alcohol was always there for me. It would change my mood around, it would relax me. I felt almost ethereal when drunk because I wouldn‚Äôt be anxious, the weight was lifted. It made me stop thinking about taking my own life.

But it was only temporary. 

I‚Äôm at the end of my legal battle (or at least this one for now) and I want to mend my ways. I don‚Äôt know whether I should just try and cut down or give it up completely. I always maintained I drink for a reason - and that reason is to get drunk. I see no other point in drinking unless I‚Äôm gonna get wasted.

Tomorrow is my birthday and I want to spend it sober. Tomorrow is also the day I‚Äôm in court, the day I told myself I‚Äôd drink to celebrate the end of this whole charade. But I don‚Äôt want to. 

I haven‚Äôt had a drink today but I‚Äôve been hung over the whole time. 

I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just rambling now. I just want a fresh start",alcoholicsanonymous
"It was a Monday and not the best day for me.  It was a date picked for me and I had to make a decision about my life.  Drinking no longer became enjoyable, it was necessary to function.  And the consequences of my drinking were quickly catching up to me.  As I was standing in the processing line, the fun part of feet on the feet, spread, squat, thank you next I remember someone saying, ""now is the time and keep an open mind.""  

It has not always been fun.  Life doesn't give me a break.  Sometimes the sun doesn't shine.  But I continue to do a quiet conversation every day with the Higher Power of my understanding and we review my character defects against what is going on in my day.  We review what happened yesterday and I am reconfirmed that my Higher Power will be handling all of my problems, worries and concerns for the day.  And the kicker to that... ""my help is not needed"".  Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps my job is to carry a message to the alcoholic who still suffers and the only thing I am responsible for and this more of a public service attestant is to put pants on each day.

If you're new, if you're struggling, reach out for help?  Don't do what I did; work the steps and enjoy your own recovery.  A life beyond my wildest dreams.... yes; life continues to come at me but I have a tool box and a list of phone numbers of men and women who I can call if needed.

My new sponsor says that I have to do the steps myself.  She just kind of tossed the 12 and 12 at me and said ""here do this.""  I'm getting seriously mixed signals over this.  Both great people.  I trust that they have both done the steps ""correctly and completely.""

I just want to start this out by saying I‚Äôve been drinking pretty heavily over the past 6 years. In the last week my wife called AA and forced me to meet with them or else she would leave me. Over the course of the week I have hand picked chapters of the AA book that I felt applied to me. I haven‚Äôt quit drinking yet but I want to. The problem I‚Äôm having is that this heavily relies on a higher power and I‚Äôm not really a religious person. After a while of thinking I want to know if it‚Äôs possible that love and compassion can be my higher power?

"If you find yourself on the other side of those doors and don't have a grip on your emotions, I understand. Though, if you think that my intentions are to uphieve or hinder what ever it is you got going on in there.. I recommend you reconsider how you view me and know that, regardless of what may have happened, I am loyal to the fact that this place and why I am here is to have some time to spend with sobriety being the environment and/or similar to symbolism, how a church is known to be the House of God.

The fact that I hold what is the combination to the keys for entry and the efforts to prevent me inside can only suggest one of two things, if not both.

‚Ä¢ The place, which has not been a self sufficient orginazation for some time now, has been inhabited by individuals without the concern of a fellow alcoholic and/or has not been addressed to what the facility facilitates currently.

‚Ä¢ Second being, the emotions in which you have towards myself, who I am and what I represent is an act against my survival (in the idea that I am a real alcoholic) because of the inability to be civilized, own to what you've done and understand that I have given forgiveness and attend these rooms without any intent to cause harm.

‚Ä¢ Justifying, though how accurate I'm unsure of, the probability in which the things I have to say and know to be the Truth are related to this facility and/or the people within. It would be in your best interest, to been seen in good light of the situation, to not necessarily have a welcoming of sorts but most certainly, the opportunity to enter without nefarious activities going on or intended to get me involved.

I don't put blame to why you might be acting the way you are. Believe it or not, a bit of practical reasoning to the behavior expressed and an understanding. Though, it does not justify what is actually going on and the prevention of an alcoholic with the desire to stop drinking.

Should there be an individual, if not all 5 of whom should be in my presence and not necessarily for my own sake, though I would appreciate the notion, but again - to be seen in good light, despite what's happened. I would highly recommend the release of all 5 women and upon the situation in where you find negotiating to be intelligent or logical, find the common sense in whom you send.

"For those that have many years of sobriety under your belts, how often do you have moments like this?  For the past day or two, I've had what I would describe as serious cravings for alcohol.  It's funny, because I'm trying to talk myself into going to the liquor store and justifying it in my head, but at the same time, I'm 100% aware of the bullshit my own brain is telling me.  I can't drink responsibly, I never have and I never will, so why do I still feel this pull towards alcohol?

"I'm usually good all day. There have been past times where I gave myself a shot of whiskey in the middle of the work day.

I must have seven shots of whiskey by now.

It's obviously something I hide from my partner... taking a swig of whiskey and then chewing or eating something to mask the smell. My mom is an alcoholic... I'm afraid I'm just winding up in her steps.

I don't like it though - it leads to bad choices. I am hugely concerned with my weight - I am bulimic - but when I'm drunk, I order whatever I want, knowing I'm going to throw it up later, so no loss.

I really dunno why I do this. It's just gotten worse. Should I start attending AA meetings... does anyone have any advice?

"Guys, I think I need some help. I started drinking about ten years ago. I never really messed with it much until I turned 21. I started drinking whiskey. I'd have a couple of drinks to wind down. And then a couple of drinks eventually turned into the whole bottle. Im a big guy and I feel like I need to emphasize that now. It got to the point to where I was drinking a fifth every day. I got sick once (not alcohol related) and went to the doctor and they discovered that my liver enzymes were elevated (obviously). They told me to stop drinking. I didn't. I did ease myself off the liquor and switched to beer. And that was fine for awhile. But then I started drinking way too much of that too. I was drunk everyday until I lost my job because I'd get hammered the night before I had to be there and didn't go. I tried to cut back. Im no longer drunk every night, but on the nights I do get drunk, I'm drinking either strong alcohol or I'm drinking well over a case of beer in a sitting. It's not good. I know it's going to kill me if I don't stop, but I honestly don't think I can. No matter what kind of trouble it causes in my life and no matter the friction it causes in my relationships, I can't seem to stop. I dont physically crave it. It's definitely more mental for me. I'm bipolar and I try to tell myself that I drink because of that. But thsts bullshit. I tell myself I drink because of my anxiety. And sometimes that's the truth. The problem is that I don't stop drinking after the anxiety has gone away. I keep going until I pass out and sometimes I pass out in embarrassing places like a frat boy. I'm middle-aged. I feel anxious when I don't have any alcohol. And the time has come for me to finally admit that this problem isn't going to go away on its own. So Im just looking for advice. I can't afford rehab. What can I do? For the record, I'm not on drugs and don't plan to do any. But I need something to replace the alcohol. It doesn't have to offer the buzz. I just need a placeholder, you know? Until I can break this habit. Any tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks, guys.",alcoholicsanonymous

I'd drink, and if I got drunk, I'd become more accentuated in my actions- I'd be louder, I'd be raunchier, I'd curse more etc and people would get offended and I'd feel like shit thinking that it was because of my drinking. 

Turns out, my ""friends"" were actually snakes in my garden manipulating me into feeling anxious and guilt over my actions and they'd blame the liquor and call me an alcoholic. I thought the issue was the alcohol. 

Turns out, now that I've been working on myself and opened my eyes to see the true issue- I was addicted to punishing myself, which would cause me to drink. Now that I've recognized that, my drinking has *significantly* deceased, I dont black out anymore, I dont get drunk but more so a tipsy, and if at a party maybe a little bit more than tipsy but I know can easily stop and switch to water. 

I never was the type drink everyday but when I did drink it would be in excess. 

I guess after years of binge drinking I've finally found the light at the end and no longer feel a prisoner to the heavy drinking. 

Moral of the story, I let people make me believe I had an addiction to alcohol when I actually had an addiction to blaming myself and punishing myself indefinitely, thankfully after removing the toxic manipulators in my circle I realize that I don't.

I like to get high, drunk 5 or 6 times a month and I‚Äôm able to resist urges to do it more then that.  Am I just lucky? Did I just win the genetic lottery? Or is there some reason to why these things haven‚Äôt done too much damage. I hope I‚Äôm not offending anyone here, I‚Äôm just curious to find some answers from real people. Not some lame article on google.

"I'm an addict who started out with drugs way back in 2010. I first got clean in 2013 and have relapsed many times since then. I relapsed with alcohol 3 months ago. I went to my first AA meeting last Sunday and they were so amazing. I left in tears, they were so helpful and caring and I plan to go back to that one every week. My next meeting that I plan to attend is today, Tuesday, and I'm looking forward to it with my best expectations. But I really need some help in between going to meetings. And I've been given a handful of numbers to ask to sponsor but tbh, I can't sponsor with someone who see's me every week at our meetings. I fuck up. Like, a lot. I give it my best try but I sit here alone in my living room every night with no one to help me or distract me. My boyfriend goes to sleep before I even get home from work because we work opposite schedules. I only drink at night, I'm not a day drinker and I don't have cravings during the day. It's the late night where I really feel the struggle. 

What I'm wondering is if anyone on here is willing to act as a sponsor, if not a sponsor then just an emotional support line? Or do you know of any fitting recommendations for me? 

Should I go the route of in real life sponsor when I literally break down in tears and seriously struggle on a nightly basis? Also, I'm a night owl who goes to bed at 4am. If I sponsor with someone from my area at my meetings... I can't call them at 3am. I know they say ""Call any time, any day"" but I would never want to inconvenience someone during those hours. That's just not realistic. 

I'm in my first week of *actually* trying to get sober and I know it's a work in progress but I know there are going to be some nights where I need to just talk to someone. I've made considerable progress but I haven't been able to completely abstain.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I started an account on reddit so I could post this. I'm a 38 year old guy, recently divorced and now living a thousand miles from my kids. I know my relationship with them can heal in time, but I moved from a major city to a very small town with no meetings. The big online AA meetings are an overload for me. Does anyone know of any smaller online meetings? Side note: what are everyone's opinions on getting an online sponsor if it's the only option for now? I can't drive for another 4 months so just trying to do whatever I can. I have 68 days sober but flying solo isn't sustainable in the long run. Thanks for any help.",alcoholicsanonymous

"i started drinking heavily when i turned 21 and could get it easily here in the us.

ive always had a vary addictive personality so ive known to stay away from hard drugs like coke and shit but now i really want to not be dependent on alcohol and im finding it really hard to do because i dont want to never drink again.

I am 2 years and 9 months sober and 11 weeks pregnant.  So far in this first trimester I am feeling like I don‚Äôt want to be around a lot of people and I‚Äôm just exhausted at the end of the day.  I don‚Äôt want to spend any extra energy talking than i have to.  I went from 6 meetings a week down to four.  I am not feeling like I get an AA gold star right now.  Also the hormones and nausea make me feel so off the beam.  I don‚Äôt want to drink and I‚Äôm not miserable yet but I think I could be doing better.

"I‚Äôll try and keep it short.. my fianc√© can‚Äôt hang when we go out. Back when we met in high-school we were both huge party animals and that also carried out into college.

Since then I have outgrown the party life (mostly) and I‚Äôm a very active triathlete who loves working out. My girlfriend on the other hand is not so active. I‚Äôm constantly trying to help her with her health goals and trying to help her be more active but she goes in and out of the gym. Which is fine that‚Äôs not the issue. Tbh when she doesn‚Äôt drink she‚Äôs still a pretty clean eater and takes care of her health (when she isn‚Äôt vaping but that comes with the drinking).

The issue is every time we go out with friends or to an event probably 8/10 times she will drink too much to the point where she gets this look on her face that looks like she isn‚Äôt mentally there. Her eyes get droopy and from there on the night always goes to shit. I have gotten to the point where I always ask her to please not drink too much anytime we decide we‚Äôre going out (Because, not drinking in a social environment isn‚Äôt really a thing for us). 

The thing is she doesn‚Äôt know her limit. She always tries to drink as much as everyone else but once she gets to that point where she‚Äôs drunk it‚Äôs like her brain completely shuts off.

This has been an issue for years and I‚Äôve tried many things like 75 hard which includes 75 days of being sober and doing other productive things to build metal toughness. 
We got to day 52 and lost and decided to try again in the future. 
That little break didn‚Äôt work. She went maybe two weeks being able to control her drinking when we go out because she knew how big of a deal it was for me to see her control herself but after she passed the limit one time she completely fell back into that same person who doesn‚Äôt stop drinking until she‚Äôs back at home in her bed. 

This has gotten so bad that every time we go on trips I can‚Äôt have a good time because she gets that drunk and I have to make sure she‚Äôs not falling over and to be honest it‚Äôs embarrassing that my fianc√© acts like that. We fight about this all the time but she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal. 

(Also just btw I literally have ptsd when I dream because of the embarrassment she causes me when we go out.)

Looking back I know realize how much pain and suffering that has caused me and recently it happened again where she gets too drunk and it ruined a night out with my coworker and his wife. My fianc√© got too drunk and embarrassed herself again. Right before she got too fucked up I told to please not drink anymore or order anymore drinks because she‚Äôs getting to THAT point and I told her I would be done with the relationship if she didn‚Äôt stop. 
she grabbed the pitcher that was at the table when I was playing pool with my coworker and had another beer and got even more fucked up. Till now she doesn‚Äôt think she did anything wrong. She has told me that she hates when she gets like that but she isn‚Äôt doing anything to stop it. I honestly feel like she might still be in denial about how she really gets but just tells me what I want to hear.

I‚Äôve come to realize she isn‚Äôt taking into consideration how it makes me feel when she gets like that. All she thinks about is her next drink. She also makes me look like the bad guy for trying to get her to stop drinking before she gets too messed up. Idk sorry if this was too long but I really love her and would love some advice on how to help. Thanks in advance üôèüèΩ

Oh also one more thing.. ‚ÄºÔ∏è her dad is a huge alcoholic and her older sister is also a very bad drunk. She HATES when they drink, probably for the same exact reason I hate when she drinks..

Any advice?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Been sober for 1.5yrs. I never considered myself an alcoholic and I'm not sure whether I do now. I know I have a bad relationship with alcohol.

I'm 31 and felt like I've struggled with alcohol for almost 10 years. I've been able to function for the most part. Successful job, relationship, good friends. But often have drunk alone, felt like I wanted to drink more or quicker than the people around me and always would sneak drinks or deliberatelyom pour myself stronger ones. I've not had any serious repercussions other than some severe hangovers and embarrassment.

Over the last 5years I've quit 3 times and before that I couldn't remember a time I'd gone longer than 1 week without drinking since I was 18. The last time I quit was because I drank like I had a death wish or something. Its hard to explain but although it was a weeknight and I knew I would feel horrible the next day I just kept drinking. Low and behold I woke up at 3am with terrible anxiety and after a hellish day or so recovering I stopped.

I didn't stop thinking 'I'm an alcoholic' and I didnt attend AA or anything.

Long story short, my partner went on a business trip this week and I found myself thinking I could go and buy some alcohol and get drunk while he's away and I've been thinking recently, maybe now I've gone so long without alcohol I could try it again. The problem is the last couple of times I've done that I just slip back into the bad habits and eventually my body and mind can't handle it anymore.

I don't want to label myself an alcoholic because I don't know if I really am. If I can go so long without drinking and could do it without AA or rehab, maybe I'm just over exaggerating. 

I suppose I find myself here because I don't have anyone to talk to about this and could use someone's perspective outside my head.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Finally bit the bullet and went to my first meeting. The meeting was all men, and I am not, so after the meeting I got like three numbers of women they knew in the program.

What do I do with these numbers? I‚Äôm not used to asking for help so I don‚Äôt even know what I would reach out to these people for. I haven‚Äôt made it back to another meeting just yet, I‚Äôm still sort of confused about how I want to engage in the program, though I plan on going back.",alcoholicsanonymous

I‚Äôve never really admitted I was an alcoholic so I never thought I would ever need AA but I‚Äôve finally decided to stop drinking and have been doing it on my own but I still slip up .

"I‚Äôm barely sober, a couple weeks with one slip up in that time.

My current sponsor is great he‚Äôs just very busy and has his own stuff he‚Äôs dealing with right now. He‚Äôs also been sober for 12 years and isn‚Äôt quite as active in AA anymore, attending a meeting about once per month. He‚Äôs kind of a tough love dude, which definitely has its place, but I don‚Äôt always get the most out of it.

"I am a drunk and a liar and a cheat.   
I've become totally and completely unrecognisable. People were kind to me and I used them, either for company or for alcohol. I was so scared of being alone that it cost me my relationship. The irony being that I never really was alone.   


The things I've done and how I have behaved to people in the last 5 years disgusts me. I know who I am at my core and that isn't it, I can't figure out why I would do so many terrible things to those around me who cared. It crept up on me and now it's like the world is a blur and I'm being passed by without really getting to live a life.   


I lost the love of my life because I simply could not stop, the compulsion was overpowering. I struggle with depression and I honestly never thought I could feel this low. I guess I am at the hopeless feeling that spurs on so many to finally quit, I really hope it works for me too.   
I just needed to get this out, I needed to be real and true for myself and so I can finally work the program.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I had way too much to drink last night. I pissed my chair threw up on the floor. I don't remember getting into bed and I threw up all over the bed too. I'm writing this as I sit on the toilet with throwup in my hair (I already took out the big pieces of throwup) 

I feel so ashamed and I feel so disgusting especially since I reek of vomit. I used to drink for a short time in highschool due to severe depression. And well here I am again. I drink hard liquor it's the only liquor I'll drink along with a melatonin at night. Last night however I went overboard. I don't know what to do. School and work is taking a backseat for my drinking and I'm ruining my own life by being so sad all the time.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Does anyone have experience with energy vampires in the fellowship? I ask because I notice when I'm a newcomer and especially if I pick up a white chip I'll have multiple people like surround me and almost vying to talk to me. After I go to the meeting for a few weeks these same people that were so kind and welcoming barely even look in my direction..I got to thinking 'ok now I'm not technically a newcomer so they need fresh blood'.or almost like now I'm in direct competiton with them for any other newcomers that happen to me wander in, desperate and looking for help. I'm always told 'youre helping me more than I'm helping you' 'you just energized me' I noticed they like to talk at you look me almost dump on you..So..

 Are recovered alcoholics like depending on a neverending supply of 'newcomers'? I know the higher power is supposed to provide the 'power'..butbwhat about people that don't believe in an almighty power and instead use the 'group' as their power.. literally. Like the program, I've heard has a dismal success rate, so most of the these newcomers won't get long term sobriety. This would mean they actually don't want everyone to recover almost like a pyramid scheme? Explains why they seem so cliquey and insular sometimes (or could be the high turnover rate guards are up)Does this like core group of sometimes cliquey recoverd alcoholics need these newcomers to like feed off their energy to maintain sobriety? Kind of like the new season of AHS? Except it's sobriety to maintain and not talent..
I haven't experienced this give at all meetings just some like insular clubhouses mainly..As a newcomer I sometimes left feeling a.overwhelmed from getting bombarded and b.sort of emotionally drained instead of feeling uplifted like I do at meetings not like what I describe..

I dunno if this sounds crazy but it makes some sense to me.

Tldr: some aa groups use newcomers as prey for energy or sobriety vampires to maintain recoverd alcoholics sobriety.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Backstory: I‚Äôm a 23 yo female, was drinking mornings/afternoons/nights roughly 4 days per week for a couple of months (late December 2020- early February 2021). Alcohol snuck up on me. My father was a severe alcoholic my entire childhood until he quit when I was 18. I started drinking ‚Äúsocially‚Äù when I was 14 and always struggled with knowing when to stop, but only drank a couple of times per month (if that) when I went out to parties with friends. 

Alcohol had never been an issue for me, other than a few blackout nights here and there during my high school years. Skip forward a few years. I didn‚Äôt begin drinking frequently (2-4 times weekly) until October of 2019. I was just getting over a severe injury and was unable to walk for 4 months. Around this time is when I also got into a relationship with my first serious boyfriend. He previously struggled with benzo addiction and had been clean for a few months before we began dating. He remained clean our entire relationship and it was never an issue, but drinking was. He drank 4-5 nights per week and after a rough night would wake up and start drinking straight away. 

Already having some struggles with knowing when to stop, I slowly but surely picked up on these bad habits and before I knew it was drinking significantly more than him. I was ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù, never lost my job, didn‚Äôt get in any trouble with the law, etc. From the outside you would have never known, but close friends and family knew there was something going on. 

Eventually our relationship came to and end and I knew my drinking had to as well. After a couple of relapses I successfully quit drinking in late February. I didn‚Äôt drink for five months. During this time I grew and changed a LOT as a person. My entire perspective on alcohol (and life tbh) changed. This entire time I‚Äôve been working with a therapist and she‚Äôs been great. For a while I thought I would never drink again, but my feelings slowly changed on that. I hated having this thing in my life that I wasn‚Äôt in control of, and having this strict rules on myself. I felt like my entire life revolved around not drinking, and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt enjoy my 20s having such a strict mentality. I wished so badly that I could join my friends going to wineries, going out on the weekends, etc. I tried hard to find other sober friends in my area in their early 20s but was unsuccessful. 

I decided I wanted to try drinking again, this time with balance. I started drinking again in august with intentions to just drink when I‚Äôm going out with friends. I don‚Äôt have any desire to get home from work and drink, drink alone, etc. I just simply want to be able to live my life, let loose here and there, and enjoy weekend drinks with friends. My therapist is on board with this. So far I‚Äôve been successful, however the past couple of weekends I‚Äôve consecutively gone out and I‚Äôve had a hard time knowing when to stop. Nothing bad happened, but it really scared me. It makes me think that this is something I might not be able to have in my life and control. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, do I chalk it up to being a hiccup and continue on with my life? Or is alcohol something I can‚Äôt have? I‚Äôm sorry this is so long. If anyone ends up reading this whole thing, thank you so so so much. I just need some advice. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself and I feel insanely guilty.",alcoholicsanonymous

"H.P. AS GUIDE

See to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great events will come to pass for you and countless others.  This is the Great Fact for us.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 164

Having a right relationship with God seemed to be an impossible order.  My chaotic past had left me filled with guilt and remorse and I wondered how this 'God business' could work.  A.A. told me that I must turn my will and my life over to the care of God, as I understand Him.  With nowhere else to turn, I went down on my knees and cried, 'God, I can't do this. Please help me!'  It was when I admitted my powerlessness that a glimmer of light began to touch my soul, and then a willingness emerged to let God control my life.  With Him as my guide, great events began to happen, and I found the beginning of sobriety.

I get that everyone has the right to share their story when invited to and thats fine. But there was no warning it was just right in my face and now i want to drink bad. I was having a good sober day until then. 

What am i supposed to do in this situation? I hated to be rude but didnt know wht else to do.

"My parents have an involved relationship with alcohol. Every day from work as soon as they get back, they'll each have 3-4 drinks a night; oftentimes, they fall asleep at 7:30-8pm while we are together as a family (ie. watching TV as a family). My mom works in healthcare and my dad works a cushy desk job that is low stress, but they'll do this even on their days off (I also work in healthcare and get up just as early, if not earlier than my parents, but I often can stay awake later). 

My brother has alcoholism and I remember during one episode during an extended family vacation he had too much to drink (which happens at least once a vacation), and my dad's mom had asked our family not to drink anymore alcohol anymore, so not to enable him. I said I would and didn't for the rest of the vacation, but my dad fought me and got belligerent when he'd secretly drink behind his mother's back after telling her he would respect that wish - ""I can drink whenever I want to"" was what he said, and although he said he can ""live without alcohol"", he wouldn't give it up. Even at home, he promised he'd drink less, but he cracks open a beer as soon as he gets home.

Is this normal? I just graduated from college (a party-heavy college, mind you) and I remember drinking only on the weekends and for special occasions. Someone I know in my life had a family member die from cancer, and the doctor apparently had attributed it to drinking moderately every single day. 

I just don't recall the last time either of my parents did not drink alcohol in a day.",alcoholicsanonymous
" Hi, I'm just gonna get straight to the point. I'm 30 years old and drinking became a major part of my life since I was 19. My mother was an alcoholic and her entire family suffered from the same disease (minus 2 aunts). I became aware of my problem when I was Mayne around the age of 25 but I just shrugged it off as ""hell I'm just having a good time"" but deep down I knew something was wrong. Fast forward too now I have a son who is 2 I now know for a fact I have a problem. I am what you call a functioning alcoholic (99% of the time). I am aware that my drinking has had effects to friends and and my immediate family. I have toned down alot but I just can't seem to drop it. With everything I went threw as a child with an alcoholic mother I don't ever wanna be that for my son. It's really hard for me to just stop drinking because I feel like I haven't done anything crazy yet ( no d.u.i, haven't lost my job, still have my family and people I care about) but ik if I keep down this path it's soon to hit the fan. For people that have been in my shoes any advice would be appreciated. I would rather get help now then before I hit rock bottom. Thanks",alcoholicsanonymous

"I recently came to conclusion that I‚Äôm an alcoholic.
I come from a family where heavy drinking is prevalent. My grandfather uncle and father have all struggled with alcoholism. None of them were able to ‚Äúovercome‚Äù it. 
I want to find a way to not rely on drinking as a coping mechanism but have no idea where to start. 
I‚Äôve tried therapy on and off for 5 years for different issues but I‚Äôm not the ‚Äútherapy type of person‚Äù. Therapy truly works for some people but I‚Äôve found no progress in it.
I‚Äôm currently looking up AA meetings in my area, but there‚Äôs so many to choose from. I suppose that‚Äôs a good problem to have. 
Is finding aa meetings a good place to start? How do I find the right place with so many options? How do I get a sponsor? Are there red flags I should look out for pertaining to staying sober? What helped you maintain an alcohol free lifestyle? What do you wish someone had told you when you first realized you were an alcoholic?
Any and all advice/ help is welcome",alcoholicsanonymous
"I'm not sure if I belong here, so I thought you'd he able to help me to define my drinking orientation? 
Don't want to offend anyone. I'm just not sure where or from who I should ask these questions -so here I am. 

My situation is that I don't really -need- to drink at all. Usually I'm not experiencing any kind of an urge when it comes to consuming alcohol.
I could spend months without even thinking about a beer, but the problematic part of the story is that when I nevertheless open that one bottle of wine (oftentimes I do that because I'm bored and someone proposes to do so and I go like &gt;why not) I just CAN'T stop drinking. 

The one fine glass of wine is never enough for me.
I always want to grab an another one, and another, and another etc. 
Sometimes I can get hooked in getting drunk, and in that case the drinking can last for several weeks. 
After all, I always find something 'more fun to do' after the experienced intensive boozing period and somehow just -forget- that I've ever even liked alcohol. 


So what do you think? Should I try to reach help, or am I even experiencing a -drinking- problem at all? Something in my behaviour is a little bit fucked up for sure (also my friends &amp;family have expressed their concern about my consumption)
but in the end I'm not convinced of that the root of my issue is alcohol at all.",alcoholicsanonymous
"My name is D and I'm alcoholic. I posted on here a week ago and I'm still going to keep posting and commenting with my no bullshit advice because that's the advice my sponsor gives me. If my presence offends you that seems more like a personal problem. I struggled a week ago, and it was refreshing to see people rooting for my relapse and having them say ""I'm glad you relapsed.""

Well, guess what? I'm still in program. I am rooting for all of you. I don't want any single one of you to have to drink again. I believe there is A solution: the steps and the Grace of God.
Good luck to all of you. Thanks for letting me share",alcoholicsanonymous

"My roommate is a severe alcoholic and is a manager at a bar. He drinks from the moment he clocks in until they close. He drinks for free and even hangs out there on his days off. Not to mention he drives home drunk after each shift. 

I understand he needs to make money but this job is killing him. He won‚Äôt listen or admit it‚Äôs a problem. At times I wish he would get fired just so he‚Äôs forced into a new career. What can I do to get him out of this industry? Or at the very least stop him from driving drunk?

"So guys i wouldn't consider myself an alcoholic in the sense that i drink everyday so i hope that my post is warranted.

however i do have 2 issues with alcohol

 1) I drink far too much when i do drink and about 7 out of 10 i end up black out drunk fortunately i have never had any legal or social consequences from my blackouts even so its bad that i binge to that extent.

2) almost always when i drink i will end up using cocaine and despise myself for doing so i only ever use cocaine when i drink, when sober i have no issue with it to the point i can be offered it and i won't take it.

Cocaine is something i very much hate myself for using but the drink makes me say fuck it.

I do intend to drink again once i learn to have those 2 issues under control.",alcoholicsanonymous
"23(F) 
I started drinking a little over 6 months ago. It started as an occasional drink here and there to destress after work. Usually never drinking more than 2-3 days out of a month and most often not even half a wine cooler. 

I'm on sertraline (generic Zoloft; depression/anxiety) and haven't been taking it for the past month or so and it feels like I'm going downhill here. I'm to the point where I'm drinking everyday (damn near all day) just to keep myself from lashing out or breaking down. 

The thing I'm most worried about is the fact that this is putting my job at risk. I work fast food.. you know - always working with either meat slicers, knives, fryers, or cleaning supplies. All of which you probably shouldn't do unless you're sober. I recently got my job back with the company after a month away (ended up quitting; unrelated situation but tldr our new store manager was a big jerk). I really want to stop before I make some terrible, life altering mistake, but I feel like I can't. 
I have tried to stop on my own before by just pouring it all out, but ended up crying and buying more 2 days later. I'm scared I won't be able to stop. I hate that I started knowing that alcoholism has run very strong in my family and I feel like I'm breaking my boyfriend's heart. (He lost both parents + a step parent to alcohol.)

I guess I'm just here looking for advice, help, resources ...just anything that's helped you. Thank you in advance for anything. ‚ù§Ô∏è",alcoholicsanonymous

I don‚Äôt have anything against religion but it‚Äôs just not for me and I don‚Äôt think just because I‚Äôm an alcoholic that religion is the only answer. I‚Äôm just at a loss. I thought I was better than this and I thought I was strong enough to do it on my own but I think I‚Äôm just lying to myself. I‚Äôm worried about my health and I‚Äôm scared of what I‚Äôve become.

"ACCEPTANCE

We admitted we couldn't lick alcohol with our own remaining resources, and so we accepted the further fact that dependence upon a Higher Power (if only our A.A. group) could do this hitherto impossible job.  The moment we were able to accept these facts fully, our release from the alcohol compulsion had begun.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 109

Freedom came to me only with my acceptance that I could turn my will and my life over to the care of my Higher Power, whom I call God.  Serenity seeped into the chaos of my life when I accepted that what I was going through was life, and that God would help me through my difficulties - and much more, as well.  Since then He has helped me through all of my difficulties!  When I accept situations as they are, not as I wish them to be, then I can begin to grow and have serenity and peace of mind.

"Started out as drinking in the kitchen because I thought it was cool when I was 17, never drank prior. Drank every now and then, then every couple days a week, then it became a daily thing, then it was whenever I went out (including work). I drink from my parents bar (it‚Äôs an at home diy bar, still quite the bit of drinks), I used to have a hook up but they crashed their car, used to get it out in Mexico. I drank it all, after I ran out I tried lemon extract before I went to work a couple days ago (absolutely terrible but I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to do it again). I remembered my parents have wine in the kitchen. I came to work after a bottle of wine and a small glass of tequila yesterday and I don‚Äôt think anyone knew, my brother and his girlfriend was there so I think they would‚Äôve said something. Nobody knows, my younger brother used to see me drink then I became embarrassed of what it turned into so I make sure nobody sees but he‚Äôs ran into me a couple times so I know they know (not the extent though). My father found liquor bottles in my closet and would‚Äôve found more if he did a thurow/thurrow (I cannot spell this word) job, I lied to him so he doesn‚Äôt know it was me alone. People who say they drank usually say they fucked up their body after years of drinking so I figure ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve only been drinking two years so once I turn blank and blank I‚Äôll stop drinking so much.‚Äù (And the two years were on and off) But I like drinking, it gives me a little happy boost, makes almost everything better, and I‚Äôve had just about no problems drinking. It makes me more outgoing and have a tad bit better personality. I want to continue but I ran out, I think this is a start of a problem that I don‚Äôt know if I want to quit just yet (but I do wish I didn‚Äôt need alcohol). I do have concerns about my body though, I would say I look healthy and I feel fine. I don‚Äôt get headaches either my morning afters are slightly shitty for a little while and tend to wake up earlier depending how much I drank.

"Hey all! I am almost a month sober (woohoo!) and physically I feel amazing. I know I need to work through the steps before making amends but the situation that got me into AA  still haunts me, even to the point where I dream about it. Long story short my partner went on vacation with two of his best friends right after we had made the scary and exciting decision to move in together. I suppose I was feeling abandoned one particular night and I got rip roaring black out wasted. I called him up and started screaming at him, telling him he should feel bad for leaving me to go on the trip. It‚Äôs worth noting that sober I told all 3 of them they deserved this trip and should have fun. Well, his friends heard me yelling, and I actually caused them to miss a dinner reservation to a restaurant they were really excited to try. After not remembering any of this I decided to finally reckon with my binge drinking problem and get some help. Me and my partner were not fine at first. He damn near left me. But we are okay now. My shame and guilt are not. I have since apologized to both of his friends (since he wanted to bring them around the apartment and I felt I needed to say something) one of them has responded to my apology, but the other has completely ignored me. She is inviting my partner to hang out without me when normally I would be invited along and hasn‚Äôt said a word to him about me apologizing either. I know amends is the fourth step and I‚Äôm still working on step one, but I feel so guilty and as though his friend has now completely written me off because of this (she is the one that planned the trip.) these are my partners two best friends and I‚Äôm finding it extremely hard to forgive myself.

"Hi everyone, I am 24 years old and I have been suffering from serious alcohol abuse for about two years now. I worked at a liquor store from the time that I was 20-22 which allowed me to get started on this type of abuse; and my parents also have struggled with alcohol and other types of substance abuse.

Since I have started drinking alcohol heavily I have noticed the sharp decline in my health, happiness,  motivation and relationship. I am slowly deteriorating and seek help. I realize I have a problem but don't know how and where to start. I am about to graduate college with a BS in finance; however I recently have lacked the motivation to finish my degree even though I am a mere 12 units from graduating and I fear this is due to my alcoholism.

I am seeking any help from those who have overcome alcoholism. I have tried to quit and ditch the habit, but have been unsuccessful. In my mind I always find a scapegoat or reasons not to ""retire"" my drinking habit. I know it is limiting my potential, interfering with my social interactions, and relationship which is why I'm searching for ways to veer from my current path.

Sometimes I'm able to go a full week without drinking but only under certain circumstances. The rest of the time I end up waking up hungover and unable to fulfil my responsibilities which I have many. I also suffer from social anxiety which doesn't help. If anyone who is a recovered or in the process of recovering alcoholic would like to share any tips of what I should do please dm me or leave a comment. I would very much appreciate it.

"Hello,

I have a really strong will, meaning that if I want to do something I do it. I think that‚Äôs been the only thing saving me somewhat all this time, but am seriously worried I might have an addiction gene and alcohol will catch up with me.

Im seriously starting to think I might have an alcohol problem. If I am not actively not drinking, I can have times when I‚Äôm drinking half a bottle of vodka a day. This week I went through two bottles of vodka and if I didn‚Äôt make the conscious effort to stop going to the store it would be three bottles.

I noticed I drink to much 5 years ago and completely stopped. I didn‚Äôt have any alcohol for 5 years until June this year. Now I‚Äôm excessively drinking again, and it will take a massive effort to decide to completely stop again. I basically started because of the Covid mandates and all that‚Äôs happening right now.

"I barely got started with a sponsee before she entered rehab (we got to steps 1-3) but she drank again as soon as she got out.

I never qualified to be a member of Al-Anon before but now I think I may need to join that fellowship because I‚Äôm so messed up over this. I‚Äôm new to the fellowship of AA myself. 8.5 months.

"Sorry if this question is stupid or has an obvious answer, I'm new to the whole addiction recovery process. I actually started attending CoDa meetings and visit the Codependency subreddit frequently, but wanted to know if sex addiction can be treated the same as alcoholism?

I've just come out of a very codependent relationship with an addict who I met on Grindr, a platform I've been using since 2014 to hook up with people. I've always been horny, and there's no problem with that. The problem arose when I started to use sex as a proxy for emotional intimacy and connection when the pandemic started (or even before that), and my relationship has traumatized me to the point that I now have to treat Grindr as if it were a drink. It's not good for me because it may give me the illusion of intimacy and connection but will only harm me more when I'm done and the other person walks away; it's literally destroying my life but I do not know how to stop it.

I'm having horrible withdrawal symptoms and am struggling so hard right now not to download the damn thing and sleep with another man for tonight, I cannot handle sleeping by myself on weekends after my last relationship tbh. Imagining my addict ex enjoying orgies while high and drinking while I'm here literally shaking just makes me want to do the same for fuck's sake.

It has brought me to the point of exposing myself to STIs, exposing myself to probably dangerous people, separating myself from my family, losing myself in the long run because I do not know how to keep healthy relationships, giving me obsessive episodes and making me violent and irascible.

I do not know what to do. Should I use Grindr and slowly seek help without cutting off 100% of my addiction? Should I keep going cutting it off completely?  Thank you if you read the whole post.",alcoholicsanonymous

  I've been an AA fly on the wall at various points in my life, but have never engaged with the program. I am a through and through athiest. I can no more convince myself that god exists than I can santaclause. Not to be condescending, but I cant think of a more apt parallel. I hold no judgement or resentment towards those that believe in god. This is not going to change. Like, its REALLY not going to change.

Everyone is incredibly welcoming, I just have such a hard time to relate to a lot of the people I met there and vice versa it seems. I tried different neighbourhoods, didn't make much of a difference. 

Any tips of how to find groups with other ""business professionals"" would be highly appreciated.

"Hello, 

I love playing video games and drinking. The only thing is my drinking feels like it's spiraling out of control. Everytime I drink, I drink to stupidity. If I'm with friend I turn into someone im not so I mostly stay home and drink. When I feel video games it doesn't feel as good like when I'm drunk. So I get drunk and then play them. The only thing is I can't stop drinking and have started drinking every other day. Everyone I go out I drink and being at home I drink too. Im currently trapped on a military base. This isolation is bullshit. I mostly just want to die. I really want to quit but I don't know how to. Does anyone have any advice? How do I quit; how do I keep myself occupied.

"LOVED BACK TO RECOVERY

Our whole treasured philosophy of self-sufficiency had to be cast aside.  This had not been done with old-fashioned willpower; it was instead a matter of developing the willingness to accept these new facts of living.  We neither ran nor fought.  But accept we did.  And then we were free.

- BEST OF THE GRAPEVINE, Vol. I, p. 198

I can be free of my old enslaving self.  After a while I recognize, and believe in, the good within myself.  I see that I have been loved back to recovery by my Higher Power, who envelops me.  My Higher Power becomes that source of love and strength that is performing a continuing miracle in me.  I am sober... and I am grateful.

"Hello,

My sponsor called me today and said someone was asking if I could be the speaker at the weekly speaker meeting of her home group. I thought you could only do this after a year, but apparently it‚Äôs any milestone, and I just passed my ninety days. 

I was terrified. I told her I could maybe talk for 5-10 minutes, but not a whole hour. She asked if I thought I could do half an hour. I asked what I would even talk about, and she said just my story. I told her that shit is none of that room‚Äôs business. 

I recently turned down chairing a meeting at that group as well, since it was a Tuesday and I go to a once weekly group that only meets on Tuesdays. I‚Äôve been told I should be saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù more when I‚Äôm asked to be of service. I said I‚Äôd be willing to chair meetings, but I‚Äôm not ready to talk about myself like that. I‚Äôm told that it shouldn‚Äôt be that big a deal because I‚Äôve been talking in the room for months now, but not like people do at speaker meetings! I‚Äôm not about to tell that whole room of over fifty people about my childhood and why I drank the way I drank, and all the shit that happened with that.

"**First off, I‚Äôd like to be honest with you all,**

I didn‚Äôt work the program. I have nothing against it, I was just scared I guess. I went to a few meetings, I got a sponsor, but I wasn‚Äôt ready and I wasn‚Äôt going to waste anyone‚Äôs time. Next thing you know, one week turned into one month and then a year and now two. It just kind of happened like that. I like to think we all end up in the same place, no matter the path taken. This my journey. 

Now that that‚Äôs out of the way. 

**My names Eric and I‚Äôm an alcoholic.** 

I was a social drinker, then an every weekend drinker, then an every night drinker and then just a flat out drunk. Wake up, grab a pull of whatever I had to take the edge off, and start my day. Drink before work. Drink at work. At some point or another it became routine maintenance. I had become an alcoholic and my life was anything but manageable. It all seemed to happen so fast. When did this happen? 

I knew at a younger age I was going to have to stop drinking. I just knew it. I‚Äôm a very obsessive person. I don‚Äôt really do many things half ass, drinking included. ‚ÄúOh, a shot? Give me the bottle. I‚Äôm 100% all in and 100 mph in which never direction chooses me. 

In my twenties I did the thing. You know, single, hung out with my friends and avoided anything that could be permanent or make me change (a relationship). I finished college and started doing what I wanted to do, I went to acting classes. I wanted to be Marlon Brando. I still do. Acting was my obsession at the time and alcohol was something I had a decent control over. 

But at some point, the alcohol took over. 

When I first moved to L.A. a co-worker of mine mentioned a story about a guy. This guy was so talented but he drank a thirty pack a day. So, he never got to be an actor. It wasn‚Äôt until I had a handle of whisky in my bedroom, I started to think ‚Äúwait, am I becoming that guy? No way. You‚Äôre a struggling actor. You‚Äôre an artist. Be tortured, throw your inhibitions away and write like Hemingway, Miller or Williams. There‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll die like them.‚Äù 

I was malicious. I was angry. I was misunderstood. I had a chip on my shoulder the size of a fifth of vodka.

I moved back to St. Louis. At the time people thought it was because I was homesick, nah, I went where the party was. I felt like I was missing out. John Goodman has this great interview where he talks about how alcohol was one of the main deciding factors on him moving to New Orleans. He wanted to be where the alcohol was. Alcoholic's have one thing in common, they all think alike. 

After a year or so of spoiling my liver and falling deeper and deeper into my alcoholism, the party suddenly ended. I met a girl. Now, the secrets out. There‚Äôs another person who knows how much I drink. She gets a front row seat to my one man show. I am now slowly becoming more and more aware of this lifestyle, that is slowly swallowing me whole and becoming my number one priority.  Everything else that I loved or had a passion for took the back seat to my daily habit. 

She was a drinker as well. Her and I used to drink every night. So in love, talking in circles, only to end up right back where we started. I wouldn‚Äôt trade those times for the world, but sometimes it feels like those were two completely different people back then.  Her family was more open about the program and being an alcoholic. I thought it was weird. I knew everything. Don‚Äôt over communicate it, don‚Äôt dissect it, just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a man. Yeah. 

A little over a year in, she decided to get sober. She went to 7 meetings a week, worked the steps, got a new job, did her passion stuff on the side, started getting more fit, laughing more, she was flat out flourishing. Then there‚Äôs me, angry as hell in the passenger seat whining about how my mom doesn‚Äôt love me. Then there‚Äôs me, complaining about how I look physically. Then there‚Äôs me, ranting for three minutes straight, blacking out in between, only to come to when everyone is looking at me like I have five fu\*kin‚Äô heads. 

She never pressured me or gave me any ultimatums.  She knew this was hard, but being in a relationship with two people is hard as well. Dialogue was had frequently and I, like most alcoholics, get angry when the dialogue is centered around my drinking.  So I do what most alcoholics do in this situation, I took offense. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I can do it? Okay."" So I‚Äôd quit. I‚Äôd go three weeks here. A month there. Then I‚Äôd take one drink and say ‚Äúsee ya later‚Äù to anything and everything. 

The last straw happened before we were supposed to take a trip to Chicago for a concert. I had not had a drink for 28 days. We were doing great. She was proud and happy and I was proud of myself as well. I had one drink while working a wedding... a fuc\*ing Moscow Mule.  Those Russians, they'll get ya.  I was off. Drunk three days before the trip, the whole trip and the way home. She didn‚Äôt accompany on my week long bender, she stayed home. 

It was the first time in my life I realized I chose drinking over someone who truly loves me for me.  

I gutted through the trip. I faked it. I was sad and on the verge of breaking down. Checking my phone every five minutes. Nothing. She was done. I could feel it. So, to cope, I drank enough to kill a small horse that weekend. All kinds of crap. Stupid stuff that I never drink. Italian cordial shots and weird stuff like that. I was with a traveling salesman, you get the picture. Now, I‚Äôve never really had panic attacks. Anxiety, yeah. But a full blown ‚Äúthis is it, this is where I die, right here on this couch in someone‚Äôs living room‚Äù type of mental breakdown, never really happened to me.  I was close a few weeks prior, but I just chalked that up to being tired. It's always something other than alcohol. The last day I woke up and knew a panic attack was coming. I could feel something that I had never really felt before. Most likely the same feeling you feel right before you die. So I did what I normally did when I felt like I was losing my mind, I ran from it. I grabbed the first bottle I could find, Gin. ‚ÄúYeah gin should do the trick‚Äù and I mixed it with some Tang, at 7 am. Tang! Like it‚Äôs ‚Äò98. I gutted it down. Only two hours until I get on the train, four more after that and I‚Äôm home. I just have to get home. 

I get a cab, barely. The gin and tang buzz has me making best friends with the cabby. So funny how drunks always think people are their best friends, when in reality, they‚Äôre just drunk at 9 am. Anyway, the impending doom had subsided for the time being.  I get to the station and have to sprint to my train. I'm rarely ever running behind, like I said, unmanageable. I get on the train ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fall asleep, wake up and be home‚Äù. Nope. Closed my eyes for about twenty minutes and the panic starts to come back. I‚Äôm starting to sweat. I‚Äôm tired. Little dots and stains cross my vision, my head is fogged and bogged down. ""I'm dying for sure on this train, this is it"". ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it‚Äù I make my way to the bar car. I manage to tame the shakes as I swipe my card. It‚Äôs just me, a very slow and stoic bartender and my medicine. I felt about two feet tall as I sit alone in a booth, staring out the window, trying to find something interesting or hopeful in the never ending fields of Kansas. I begin to cry. And cry. And cry.  The bartender's just looking at me the way anyone would look at a grown man who is drunk at 10am and crying. For 4 straight hours I had tears running down my face and a cold plastic cup in my hand to help get me through it. 

I listened to 2 songs on repeat ‚ÄúLast Time‚Äù and ‚ÄúChange 4 Love‚Äù over and over again.  All I kept thinking about was how I let my person down, I continue to let myself down, I am not a good brother, I am not a good son, I am not a good role model, I am slowly becoming a statistic and there is zero chance I will ever become anything close to significant if I keep this up. Then it hit me ‚Äúholy shit, I have to stop drinking‚Äù. 

I lived in Vegas for a few years. What a great place for a drunk, right? One of my best friends had a grandfather who quit drinking ‚Äúcold turkey‚Äù. When you‚Äôre in your mid twenties, that seems insane and unimaginable. I didn‚Äôt believe it. Then they pointed to a bar stool and said ‚Äúhe drank his beer, said I‚Äôm done and never went back to it‚Äù. I thought that was incredible. That story always stuck with me. Every once in a while someone will say something significant to you. Something about it will resonate and you realize they weren't saying it to you, they were saying it for you.  That story made so much more sense to me on the train, it clicked. I believe I felt, for the first time, what my friends grandfather may have felt that day. The parties over, man. You‚Äôre done. You did your dance with the thing and you‚Äôve been off beat for too long. Your life and family are more important than this pint. You're done. 

So, I get home. I call my girlfriend and tell her ""I think I'm ready.  What do I need to do? I will do anything you ask of me.  I need help"".  We talked and I cried and she cried and then I get off the phone, I grab two airplane shots of whisky and four beers.  I wasn't going to get drunk, I was weening myself off. I know, I did it the way you‚Äôre not supposed to.  I should‚Äôve checked into a clinic or hospital but I didn‚Äôt. Something seriously bad could‚Äôve happened to me and I do not recommend anyone else doing the same. I know myself. I had to go through it alone and face myself. Just me, my mirror and my thoughts. That‚Äôs all I wanted. That and the occasional sip of a beer or whisky to keep the edge off. 

What I went through that night and the following day, I wouldn‚Äôt wish on my worst enemy. I‚Äôve had hangovers. This was my body saying ‚Äúyeah, do it again. Come on. Drink again and we will shut your sh\*t down for good‚Äù. There‚Äôs a scene from the movie ‚ÄúBasketball Diaries‚Äù where Jim is coming off of heroin, that‚Äôs how I felt. Not as dramatic, because it‚Äôs Leo, but that‚Äôs how I imagined I looked. 

I made it through it. And I‚Äôm happy to say I haven‚Äôt had a drink since. Today marks my two years and I am very proud of myself. My girlfriend and I are better than ever. Both sober. After I was sober for six months, I was finally ready to move back to L.A. where I can pursue my thing and she can get her masters. All was good. Then, about three weeks after we settled in, the whole world shut down. Yeah, perfect. Two recovering alcoholics leaning on one another in a new city. If I was still drinking, there‚Äôs no doubt I would‚Äôve drown in my apartment complexes swimming pool. I mean, this lockdown was a drunks wet dream. Free money, no meetings or work. I am so grateful I chose to get sober when I did. 

Since being sober, I‚Äôve made two short films, got into some festivals, made a web series, writing a feature now, made some music that I‚Äôve wanted to make since I was 17, gained some weight, lost some weight, got a therapist and plan to ask the girl I used to drink with every night to be the person I share a home with for the rest of our lives. 

I don‚Äôt have a problem being around alcohol. Do the thoughts creep in? Of course. Hell, the last two weeks have been extremely tough. This subreddit helps a lot. I don‚Äôt judge, envy or resent anyone who‚Äôs able to drink.. I couldn‚Äôt do it and that‚Äôs the simple truth.  It's not their fault I can't do it, it's mine.  There are plenty of things I can‚Äôt do, so I don‚Äôt do them. I wrecked every motorcycle I got on when I was a kid, so I stay away from them as an adult. I. Can‚Äôt. Drink. You think a person who can‚Äôt swim, dives off a boat in the middle of the ocean?  No, they know They. Can‚Äôt. Swim. Because they tried it and they almost died. It‚Äôs not that simple but it kind of is. I had to admit I was powerless over alcohol, admit defeat, swallow my pride and give 100% of myself to my sobriety. 

To all my guys out there, it‚Äôs okay to lose. It‚Äôs okay to cry. It‚Äôs okay to be in pain. It‚Äôs okay to admit defeat. No matter how big or strong you you think are, this thing is just as big and strong, but not undefeated. 

For everyone who thinks it‚Äôs hopeless or you‚Äôll never stop, it isn‚Äôt hopeless and you will stop, if and when you decide to. Listen when people tell you they love you, because you are loved. If you‚Äôve got a couple hours, days, weeks, months or years sober, be proud of yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be patient with yourself. Sobriety is hardly ever a linear path. Keep going! I promise you there is nothing in life that alcohol has made better. Being present with your emotions and planted in the moment are the greatest joys life can give you. I could slip up tomorrow, I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is, I‚Äôm two years sober today and my fingers hurt. 

Sincerely,

\-EC

"Hi all,

Per the subject line, I'm a small time filmmaker creating short documentaries about individual addicts/alcoholics and their stories. The aim is to humanize addiction and remove some of the taboo.

I'm trying to turn it into a feature that'll explore both the science of the chemical/genetic causes of addiction as well as the mental health factors in addition to a plethora of interesting and inspiring stories.

The link is below. I hate asking this, but if you could give it a view/like/comment it would really boost my chances of getting funding.

"Hi, I've commented on a few peoples posts and tried to help but haven't actually posted until now because everyone else's achievements have all seemed so much greater than mine but anyway I thought I'd post a small achievement I feel proud of!

So this is day 50 for me completely sober, with the help of The Big Book, support of my parents and also this group. (thank you!) Before this I had tried (and failed) on more occasions than I care to admit! But this time feels different. I'm 34 years old and drank a bottle of vodka every single morning at 6am as soon as the shop opened, I then functioned as usual until going back to the shop, rinsed and repeated this for about 3 years every single day only stopping when I was passed out. I then tried to stop which ended in a hospital stay and the most severe withdrawals and dt's, actually assaulting a nurse and throwing a fire extinguisher at another because of how bad the dt's were. (I have never hit anyone in my entire life!)

Anyway, I feel after admitting I was powerless to alcohol and conceding that I could never be 'normal' and 'control' the alcohol, the weight lifted off my shoulders, I focused on myself and took Antabuse every day which I'm still on. I am due my license back for driving next month (last year I was due it back but due to a previous ban and blood test result I was told I was too high risk) and know that any blood test now will show 0% alcohol. During this time I have also managed to start 2 successful businesses which I also owe thanks to everyone who have helped me, I'm thinking clearly for the first time in about 7 years now.

I by no means feel like I'm 'over' this or 'cured' because this is a life long fight but I do know that if you have the belief and strength, most importantly the will power you can change your life around, alcohol is a drug and this is a disease for us all, day 50 is a check point as this is a marathon and not a sprint. I hope to be where a lot of you guys are and writing on here in 10 years time celebrating that milestone, but for now, it's 1 day at a timeüòä

"(Years ago) I get nervous with flying and so the night before I flew, I drank about it. A friend gave me a pill to help, not knowing how much I drank. I came to, on a flight not knowing where I was or where I was going because of how far out my blackout reached. The flight attendant was standing over me as people exited the plane. I stood up and ran off, scurrying underneath her armpit. I left my carry-on, on the plane and made my way outside bumming cigarettes until I was fully aware. Finally made my way to ‚Äòlost luggage‚Äô and watched the flight attendant drag my bag in angrily, saying nothing. My family was waiting for me in that city and I couldn‚Äôt explain why I was stuck at the airport. Flash forward 2 months and the person who was sitting next to me on the flight saw me at a bar (I bartend). He asked if I remembered anything and no, of course not. He told me that everyone had asked to move away from me on the flight. He told me exactly my behavior and had his beer and left. I could see the sheer disgust in his face. And rightfully so. If you think about drinking today, this is one of my many spiral stories where I‚Äôve learned. I can‚Äôt handle the casual drink. I feel better with water and I don‚Äôt wake up anymore not knowing. Will we always be our past? Meh, I don‚Äôt think so. But we do make lasting impressions. I can do better with making life better for the people around me. I WAS making it worse.",alcoholicsanonymous
"After 10+ years struggling with booze, I've finally said enough. I spent last summer drowning in self-pitty, destruction and desperation. Not that it changed much. Until recently. The past year (dealing with the loss of my job, reputation, family and friends) I returned back to the trusty bottle.

In the midst of the chaos, I realized that something HAD to change. During my own recovery, I felt an urgent need to share mine and others' stories, tools and findings with other people going through the same.

Here's where you come in.

I'm building an online program for people questioning, struggling and/or wanting to make a change with respect to their relationship with alcohol. I've created a survey to help decipher this deeply complex, and personal struggle to shed light on more ways to help others.

"I‚Äôve been getting drunk at least 3 times a week for 6-ish months and I kept trying to stop bur was only able to if I physically couldn‚Äôt drink for some reason. My longest streak was 21 days because I went on vacation with my parents and I couldn‚Äôt sneak alcohol, plus I got incredibly sick so getting drunk wasn‚Äôt really on my mind at the time. 

I recently adopted a 4 month old kitten and had to take another round of antibiotics so I took it as an opportunity to stay sober and I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôve made it 10 days with only a few mild urges to drink here and there. However today one of my college classes was canceled after I made sure to wake up early enough to make it on time and even went to get coffee before and that just sent me over the edge. I‚Äôm still on campus so I couldn‚Äôt get any alcohol but I was so close to saying fuck it and buying a bottle of vodka and now I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to cave soon since my mom is having a birthday party today and there will obviously be alcohol and so many opportunities to sneak drinks. 

Not only that but I‚Äôm 21 so I can just buy alcohol myself but the temptation of having it the house is so much and I‚Äôve been able to resist it because my parents know I have a ‚Äúdrinking problem‚Äù but I can‚Äôt talk about it with them because they‚Äôre not supportive whatsoever and will just guilt me and ask if I need to go to rehab which makes me feel worse.

Any tips for staying sober?",alcoholicsanonymous

"I stumbled upon this and thought I'd share:

""In Alcoholics Anonymous we learn that resentment is¬†a¬†condition or state of mind whereby one relives some past event, and feels the¬†emotion from that event as if it were happening right now. Resentment is literally¬†to¬†feel (sentire) again (re), and it is the fuel that feeds the fires of our addictions.""

Re-feeling.

That really makes sense to me. Its hard to live a happy life when I'm re-feeling the emotions of past events constantly.  Its even harder to stay sober re-feeling all that stuff so I drank more. The more I drank, the more there was to be resentful for. It was a never ending cycle for me.

The steps helped shed those resentment and today I no longer re-feel the emotions of those past events.

Im grateful for AA.",alcoholicsanonymous
"My sober husband, 10 years, is online AA group. He has daily calls and texts with female member. Says only friends but I'm worried it's turned into emotional affair.

"I have been drinking pretty heavy since Covid and working from home. Usually a pint of gin a day sometimes a whole pint

So this is been going on for a year and a half. I am starting out patient rehab. 

Need to know if detox is necessary for my situation. I can go 24 hours without alcohol and feel fine. How much do you have to drink daily to get withdrawals serious enough for a hospital detox?

"So I have been struggling to quit drinking for the last 3 years. I managed to make it till 2 months on several occassions and obviously it felt amazing to be sober for that long. Lately I noticed that I have mild physical withdrawal symptoms after a hard night and I've been drinking to avoid that, especially when I wake up at the middle of the night. I want to stop, in July I had another 3 weeks sober but then relapsed. What I feel now and always before an abstinence attempt is this general fear for my wellbeing and health but what's crazy for me is that I fear that not drinking will kill me. I never have really bad withdrawals, usually they go away in a few hours after my last drink. Any advice?",alcoholicsanonymous
"I hear, and have been told a lot, about a sponsor. I know how to find one, but how do I do it when I don't trust anyone due to ptsd, and I have severe social anxiety. Not just bad anxiety, but SEVERE.

I know it sounds cheesy but for me it was something I could say and mean, focus on it, there are only more better days ahead and suffering is a condition of life, not a quality of spirit.

"I don't know why I'm posting here, honestly.  I don't want to spin up some sob story or go on a rant about how AA ""doesn't work"" or is ""god-overloaded and unscientific"".  I may have done that years ago but I had a psychic change, truly - that was the result of throwing myself into the middle of AA for years and putting it first above everything.

The result is my life unfolded into something better than I could have ever imagined and my horizons continue to expand.  I'm no longer plagued with the inescapable urge to drink or do drugs, and have long since learned that wasn't the issue to begin with and have grown and changed though writing, meditation, working with others, service, etc.

I don't want to do any of it anymore.  I'm fully immersed in an isolation lifestyle and really don't want to see anyone or do much of anything.  I still attend a few meeting a week and an H&amp;I, but have fallen out of touch with my sponsor, stopped daily practices, never open the book or do writing or work with new people anymore.

I've sponsored a small nation of newly sober alcoholics (I live in an area with a high prevalence of recovery homes and facilities, so there is a never-ending stream of people raising their hand looking for a sponsor) and done service at many levels (from the individual to the intergroup and more) and have learned a lot about myself, etc.

But I'm not immune to the slow, latent degradation in perspective and outlook that plagues an alcoholic like me.  Time alone and distance from the center means a slow moving lens starts to color my vision again, and I'm the last one to realize it as I become convinced that they, the job, the money, the girl, the property, the prestige - is the problem, and not me.

I know all this because I've been here before - there is more than one surrender in long-term sobriety (especially for an emotional-child neurotic alcoholic like me) and letting go / growing up is hard to do.

But I've had some falling outs with people I was once very close to, and friendships and relationships that ended so callously it's hard to show my face at my homegroup of almost 6 years anymore because they are always there and they won't speak to me.  I just want closure on some of these things, I want resolution, and thought it was in the nature of an alcoholic that is practicing the principles to be kind and loving and tolerant.

But I am so hurt by how I've been treated by some ex-friends in the program and these people won't answer a call, text or say a word to me yet sit across from me at a table in a group of men on a weekday evening that I love, and I am so uncomfortable and frustrated by that.

These are friends I've spent holidays with, I know their families, spent long hours on calls discussing sensitive topics as we do and they've been rocks in my life, people I can depend on.  And I, within 6 months, was essentially ghosted by them.  No calls, texts, etc - after relatively small disagreements.  I've never experienced this type of thing in my life, even when I was drinking/using I've been able to mend relationships and am regularly in touch with at least 5 close friends of roughly 15 years or more.

And my head tells me ""this is what AA is composed of.  People that justify and rationalize behavior like that behind the guise of spirituality and through some warped lens have found it okay for some reason to be incredibly cold to a good friend (I am, I know that) and still get up at the podium and preach love and tolerance"".

I can't get that record to stop, and its driving me out the door.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Just curious as I have started saying the Serenity Prayer the way it is written on page 125 of the ‚ÄòTwelve Steps and Twelve Traditions‚Äô.

God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, 
Courage to change the things we can,
And wisdom to know the difference.

I love this one as in my recovery I have found that this is a program and fellowship of we, not me.

I have been in one group where they tried to change it in the Group Conscience, however, I do not believe this is the correct way about it as it is just forcing people to say something they may not be ready to accept.

Which version do you use? Do you see a difference between the version on pg. 41 in the 12&amp;12/the original prayer? Why do you think Bill Wilson has two versions within the same book?",alcoholicsanonymous
"I'm thinking about attending a meeting next week, but I'm kind of anxious about navigating it. Been almost fifteen months since I've picked up a drink (1 year, 2 months, and 27 days/453 days total). I don't know if y'all call that sober, dry, or whatever else, but I've let it hold me back from trying meetings for a while now. First, I didn't attend because of the pandemic. I wanted to try in person. Now that those meetings are back, I'd like to attend. Probably regularly--I think it could really benefit me. 

What would the program look like for me, though? I don't want any special permissions or exemptions, but I also don't want to take valuable time, resources, and attention from those in earlier, more urgent stages of sobriety. Would I be able to get a sponsor and run the steps still?",alcoholicsanonymous
"Last night was my boyfriends birthday. I threw a party for him and his friends and ultimately I got too drunk. It‚Äôs nothing new and I drink almost daily.

"Hello, so since last years of high school i ve been drinking pretty frequently, more than twice a month. Sometimes, during summer i drink for more than 2 days in a row. I dont have urge to drink or that i need tk drink, but most of my friends are drinking on the weekend or spending time with theyr special one. I dont want to spend time alone on friday evening so i usually go to party and drink, alot. I cant drink a little, i always drink till there is no more drinks left and from that i get sickening bad hangover. I want to find hobbies that i could do on my own so i would not need to go looking for party to spend my time on the weekend.

Could you guys help me find idea, how to spend time on the weekends if all i know is drinking? How to find other ways to feel happy? What coping mechanisms have you guys used when cutting alcohol out of your life?

"WE STAND - OR FALL - TOGETHER

... no society of men and women ever had a more urgent need for continuous effectiveness and permanent unity.  We alcoholics see that we must work together and hang together, else most of us will finally die alone.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 561

Just as the Twelve Steps of A.A. are written in a specific sequence for a reason, so it is with the Twelve Traditions.  The First Step and the First Tradition attempt to instill in me enough humility to allow me a chance at survival.  Together they are the basic foundation upon which the Steps and Traditions that follow are built.  It is a process of ego deflation which allows me to grow as an individual through the Steps, and as a contributing member of a group through the Traditions.  Full acceptance of the First Tradition allows me to set aside personal ambitions, fears and anger when they are in conflict with the common good, thus permitting me to work with others for our mutual survival.  Without Tradition One I stand little chance of maintaining the unity required to work with others effectively, and I also stand to lose the remaining Traditions, the Fellowship, and my life.

"When I met my first sponsor, we talked about what my program with her might look like and what she expected of me. At some point in the conversation we started talking about the 4th step and I was adamant that I wouldn‚Äôt forgive the man who r*ped. She stopped me there and told me that an amends does not equal forgiving the person who harmed me. It‚Äôs about finding peace with what happened and ether I chose to forgive the person or not was entirely separate. 

What she said really changed my perspective and I‚Äôve since chosen to make amends with my past (whether that be forgiving some people or just making amends with it).

"I'm a 26 y/o female, have been an alcoholic most of my life. I have been ready for help for a long time, but I am always weak as soon as my Friday at work comes, and end up buying bottles of wine to drink on my days off. I have been only buying wine for the last, maybe 2 years because I used to drink hard liquor and it always turned up a mess. Waking up in the ER, jail, etc..  so in my mind, since wine didn't put me in those positions, I thought drinking only wine was fine. It's turned out where I drink multiple bottles a day, my mental health is suffering, and so much of my life is being wasted. I want to be sober so bad, but I feel so weak. I have agoraphobia and severe anxiety on top of other illnesses, but those 2 keep me from attending meetings like I'd like to. I want a regular support fellowship but the last meeting I went to, I had a bunch of older men try to hit on me and it made me feel alone because I just want help like everyone else there.

"I just want somewhere kind of private to mark this because I want to be one of those people that can recall the last time they were sober.

I showed up to my fianc√©‚Äôs OB appointment (viability scan) after drinking 4 cans of beer - because you can only get the tasty ones that way - and I wasn‚Äôt really sure where to hide the evidence (yes, stupid logic). It was in the early afternoon and I got mad when she called me out for drinking before such an important day and for being late.. so I stormed off and drank some more.

So, our baby has a healthy heartbeat at ~7 weeks‚Ä¶ we had a devastating miscarriage this year and we are fortunate to have another chance at our age. I need to do better for a potential baby and for my fianc√©.  I feel like someone is crying out.. do it for yourself‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not quite there.

"My bf has gone off the deepened since his fathers Death four months ago. He was holding strong for a couple weeks but then bombed when it came time to actually go to his dads funeral in another state. He got so drunk he missed the flight and funeral completely. Since then he has lost his job, not cared one bit and has been drinking like 20 90% proof shots along with alcohol a day for over two months now. He had a seizure trying to detox because his stomach hurt so bad he physically couldn‚Äôt drink. Spent 5 days in the hospital and he‚Äôs back to drinking worse off than he was before. He has had a problem with alcohol in the past before I know him. We met in rehab 3 years ago. I have been sober ever since and my drinking before rehab was a clear joke to what the heck he is doing now. Like buying 35 shooters at once is fucking crazy. He says no to seeing a therapist, psychiatrist, going to live in a sober home, going back to rehab, Even going back to the hospital. He is drunk 80% of the time I talk to him now. I go over to his house to clean up and make sure he showers and stuff hits it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it‚Äôs exhausting! And coincidently his mom is having to deal with this DOUBLE because his older sister is doing the exact same shit. His sister has actually gone to rehab and stuff but she called me the other day and either she‚Äôs just a plain lunatic or she‚Äôs back to drinking, her thoughts were all over the place. It was sad how intoxicated she sounded because I know how exhausted their mom must be. He tells me he loves me but whenever I bring up stopping drinking or anything of the sort he gets super mad and tells me when I talk about that stuff it only wants him to drink more. I‚Äôve tried EVERYTHING to stop his drinking. His dumb ass mom thought he needed a new debit card like a month ago to help with an old joint bank account they had that was affecting her credit because he had a $900 past due amount so I helped him get one and turns out it was resolved months ago so he never needed that new stream of income, which was 100,000 dollars he got from his dad. So now not only does he think he doesn‚Äôt need to work but he‚Äôs gonna die people! And he doesn‚Äôt feel bad at all that I had to watch him have  seizures and have to call the police. I want to know if I can like hire 2-3 very big strong men to hold him at gunpoint for like ‚Ä¶2-3 weeks?? üòÇ just so his mind is back to normal.

I‚Äôm actually concerned he would do that so I‚Äôm really curious lol I need help and I don‚Äôt know what else to do besides force him into some moments of clarity so he can make a good decision, because right  oh get now he is so drunk all the time he can‚Äôt even remember conversations we‚Äôve had or the day it is, let alone make a choice to be sober üò¢",alcoholicsanonymous

I‚Äôm so tired of being tired. I‚Äôm sad, I‚Äôm in pain and like I said just really tired. I‚Äôm not sure why alcohol is so accepted in our society when it truly is a killer.

I can be awake for days and I don‚Äôt feel safe driving when I‚Äôm half asleep. I hate insomnia.

"First things first.

I'm resentful at treatment center and addicts showing up to my meetings and asking what my drug of choice was.

""Alcohol believe it or not, that's why I go to AA meetings.""

I'm so sick of the hypocrisy in the AA fellowship, I may be a lot of things, but when I go to AA I'm not trying to unite through recovery from other things.

The solution is what I do, the sickness is what I did.

Addiction may be the opposite of connection, but absolution is the opposite of alcoholism, not abolition.

I drink coffee, energy drinks, smoke cigarettes and herb, love strippers and fuck models, that's what freedom from alcohol gave me. I just had to heal the issues surrounding those things instead of avoid them, and that progress is growth.

Encouragement doesn't mean condemnation, I try to turn my judgement inward but that still doesn't help me connect with addicts who aren't also Alcoholics.",alcoholicsanonymous

Life is better without alcohol.  A.A. and the presence of a Higher Power keeps me sober, but the grace of God does even better; it brings service into my life.  Contact with the A.A. program teaches me a new and greater understanding of what Alcoholics Anonymous is and what it does, but most importantly, it helps to show me who I am: an alcoholic who needs the constant experience of the Alcoholics Anonymous program so that I may live a life given to me by my Higher Power.

"1 week no alcohol, no weed

I‚Äôm a 24 year old male who has been drinking and smoking weed daily since sophomore year of college. My girlfriend lives with me and also enjoys dancing with the devil. 

I admitted to myself several months ago that I‚Äôm an alcoholic, plain and simple. Ever since then I‚Äôve been trying to navigate the challenging journey of sobriety with several failed attempts. 

I would stop for a few days and then think I had everything under control. How wrong I was. The day after having a drink I‚Äôd find myself waiting at the liquor store at 11am waiting for it to open so I could have my six pack and then smoke half a gram of distillate (85% thc). 

My first failed attempts were a result of me only putting one foot forward and not both. I thought to mysef ‚ÄúI‚Äôll smoke weed to help take my mind off the alcohol,‚Äù but as i‚Äôm sure others can relate to, that only made my cravings worse. Not just that, but it made my thinking and decision making skills go out the window. Of course I ended right back at square one.. But not this time. 

I‚Äôm 7.5 days totally sober and am feeling much more optimistic in life. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the first 4 days were brutal. I had night sweats, hands shaking, incredibly irratible mood, but I knew that this was just my brain chemistry changing and the process of toxin removal had begun. I found what helps me most is reading what others have gone through and what works for them. Knowing i‚Äôm not alone in this journey has brought some peace of mind and given me confidence. 

That being said, I know my journey has just begun and I have an enormous amount of work to do. Here are some tips that have been helpful to me thus far in the early stages:

1) Exercise daily and go for walks. This helps take my mind off the cravings in a healthy way.

2) Tell your loved ones and close friends about your intentions to stay sober. Nothing is worse than having a family member or girlfriend asking if you want a beer (atleast for me during the early stages, hopefully this will pass).

3) Listen to podcasts. This is a great way to combat bordom and there are so many different topics to listen to.

4) Netflix/Video games/music/hobbies/sports all help immerse yoursef in something other than drinking. 

Stay strong. Peace and good vibes to all‚ú®",alcoholicsanonymous
"It really doesn't seem like much but funny enough a month ago I could not imagine going one single day with out at least 2 or 3 tall boys- it hardly ever stopped there. What inspires me to make this post is I have fallen back on a past job. My drinking has left me with no lover, no friends, no family, all alone and so broke I can't pay attention. Today I got off work and some of my old people I would drink with after work offered me a beer. I politely declined and stated that I was trying to stop drinking all together. But as the night progressed I got myself upset over my situation and found myself hanging around with the people drinking having thoughts of drinking. Even now find myself reasoning on why it wouldn't be super terrible if I still drank. (It would be) This job is pretty good paying and I find it fairly easily. 

Was curious what you guys do when you are met with temptation in the face like that? I didn't fold so I suppose I did something right but I very well could have.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Year after year I knew in the back of my mind that my drinking was a problem. After drinking my first year of college, none of my roommates wanted to live with me anymore and they felt strong enough about it to warn all our other friends not to move in with me. I moved in with my girlfriend and we drank our nights away. I never graduated.

Ten years later, my drinking never quite seemed to get any better. People were moving on with careers and families, I had a sense I was being left behind.  I knew it as a fact, there was no way to quit and that no one on earth could help me. I thought if only I could take 5 months off from work to hike the Appalachian Trail (AT) I would be isolated enough from my drinking buddies and my drinking lifestyle, that would have to do the trick.  I‚Äôd had no choice but to be sober out there on the trail, it would be hard to find anything to drink with just the contents of my backpack.

That false mindset, a fake belief that I could only get sober by being on what amounted to a deserted island, was exactly what my disease told me to keep me drinking. I was never able to quit work and hike the AT.  I kept working and drinking another ten years. The truth is AA WOULD have worked and it doesn't require me to quit my job to do it!

I was hiking today, as this all came back to me. I realized that whenever I start romanticizing having a drink, it‚Äôs always tied to some past feeling. An experience that is long since gone, and simply does not exist anymore. Drinking is never going to bring back this old sensation that only lives in my memories. The AT isn‚Äôt going to get me sober. But when I start working the AA program with honest intentions, I can get sober. One day at a time.",alcoholicsanonymous
"What does it accomplish? Most things I'm willing to share with my sponsor, I can see how telling someone who isn't as sick as me could be beneficial. Like a lot of my resentments I thought were pretty justified until my sponsor pointed out how absolutely insane and sick they were. 

But what about the things I KNOW are wrong? Like there's absolutely no justification for that you'd never wanna share with someone. I feel some things are between me and god. I don't need another human being to know about what I already know is wrong.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I was sober for a month and going to meetings. Missed last week, but here tonight. Had a good talk with my therapist today, and he realizes now how I think and perceive the world. 

Cars, crowds, people, lights, people touching me overwhelm me. Sounds to him that I feel like I don't belong in this world. It is true. I hate people. I hate noise. 

Started off saying I sounded like I was codependent on other people for my happiness and I should go to AA more and ended with him thinking I have severe social anxiety and maybe big group meetings aren't for me and if I go someone should go with me. 

How do normal people cope?",alcoholicsanonymous
"This is a clubhouse, with 45 meetings/week

At the last business meeting, I picked up a commitment‚Ä¶ chairing Tuesday, Came To Believe @ 8PM. Someone else wanted it too, so we split it. He‚Äôs doing weeks 1&amp;3, I‚Äôm doing weeks 2&amp;4‚Ä¶ 

So immediately after I get the commitment, I asked my sponsor to speak for me. He said yes, and made arrangements. Him, his brother, &amp; their friend all planned on coming tonight @ 8. 

One of the group reps hits me up last night &amp; is like, ‚ÄúI thought Xxxxx had the commitment but I been telling this guy he can share for his 90 days, sorry.‚Äù

I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúwell I already got someone speaking for me.‚Äù 

&amp; then he goes on about how I should let the dude w 90 days speak. It‚Äôs how the program works, etc. 

But my thing is‚Ä¶ my sponsor already committed to it &amp; made arrangements‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs my meeting/commitment. You ask / tell me not even 24 hours prior. &amp; there‚Äôs 45 fucking meetings a week at this joint. While most of the commitments rotate, there‚Äôs some guys who have like ‚Äúflagship‚Äù meetings, &amp; are really good at it, and have been doing that day &amp; time slot for years. For instance, I‚Äôm sure he wouldn‚Äôt tell the guy who does Thursday @ 8, ‚ÄúSorry bud you can‚Äôt do your big book breakdown tonight, I told someone they could speak for their 90‚Äù

It‚Äôs my commitment. There‚Äôs 44 other meetings this week he can share at.

"Can we talk about people‚Äôs experiences because I‚Äôm so calm and at peace right now.

I‚Äôve started my step five today with my sponsor. Finishing the rest tomorrow. Had to dig really deep and talk about a lot of trauma and I came to realise that I was holding people to a higher account than I had myself and harbouring resentment over things they did to the best of their abilities at the time. I also felt owed something when someone did something that hurt me yet when I did something I should get a free pass apparently because I‚Äôm owed it due to my past. The beginning of this step I was bricking it. I‚Äôm only half way through and somehow I‚Äôm not worried about the second half tomorrow. My thoughts aren‚Äôt full of anger and resentment. If anything I just feel that I can pray for them now from a place of knowing they did their best , even though it was wrong. üôè
Is this the start of spiritual awakening ? Feeling genuinely sorry for predators and people that caused me wrong doing as they are only human too and I think my character defects have clouded that so much. 

My higher power has definitely helped me see the bigger picture today a lot and be able to connect the dots and not have a big black cloud over it all. Tonight I will pray with more sincerity over some people that I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever be able to. With no resentment towards them and maybe empathy‚Ä¶ not sure if this is the meaning of empathy too. Thought I didn‚Äôt have emotions until today and I feel truly set free by some baggage

"Hello friends,  

I am an adult daughter of an alcoholic. Without going into too many details, she needs help. She has crossed a line where she is negatively impacting the mental health of my younger siblings.

I love her very much, and I want to see her happy and doing well again. This has gone on for far too long, and she's going to lose her family if nothing changes. 

I would appreciate any tips you might be able to give me on how best to broach the topic with her.

"4 months this time. Don‚Äôt know why I even bothered trying again. What‚Äôs the point of staying sober? It‚Äôs changes nothing. Even going sober for a year didn‚Äôt help. Should‚Äôve learned my lesson after that. Hell, it‚Äôs actually worse in a lot of ways. And if it doesn‚Äôt make me feel any better, what‚Äôs the goddamn point? Then again there‚Äôs not really a point to anything‚Ä¶

At least being drunk is filling in time. Serves as a distraction from the constant loop of suicidal thoughts always playing in my goddamn head. Nothing else distracts me from it. It‚Äôs like my personal Final Destination film up there. Hell, it‚Äôs more like 5 Final Destination films. Guess I‚Äôve always been creative, just wish I could use it for coming up with something other than new and exciting ways to kill myself. 

Medication doesn‚Äôt work. Therapy doesn‚Äôt work. Hell, I ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù with my latest therapist earlier today. Sat on the phone with him and endured him telling me about how great it‚Äôs gonna be when we‚Äôre outta lockdown in a couple weeks. Told him before, makes no difference to me. I don‚Äôt go anywhere anyway. Nothing to do, no one to see. Lockdown is just business as goddamn usual. I don‚Äôt give a shit about the virus or the situation or any of this. 

Only thing that bothers me about COVID is that apparently if you‚Äôve got mental issues nowadays, everyone assumes it‚Äôs cause of that. It‚Äôs like therapists and shit refuse to believe it‚Äôs possible for someone to not give two shits about any of it because life sucked long before the fucking pandemic showed up on the scene and it‚Äôll suck long after it‚Äôs gone. I don‚Äôt leave the house and death sounds like a dream to me, so what the hell would I be distressed about?

Anyway, 15 minutes of explaining all this once again and the dude just goes silent, like he doesn‚Äôt know how to handle someone as far in the pit as I am. Not sure what clients he expects in that field, but maybe I really am an overachiever when it comes to being suicidally depressed. Either way, I just told him this shit isn‚Äôt helping and told him I don‚Äôt need his services anymore. He thanked me for my ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù. Hah. Closest thing to funny I‚Äôve heard in a while. ‚ÄòCept for the sick joke I call my life, think that one will always be on top.

"So I just booked flights to the UK/Ireland for the holidays (Dec/Jan) to see family and to visit my partner‚Äôs family. Woohoo! Except, now my mind goes to drinking. I‚Äôm feeling very conflicted. The last time I was abroad, I was 17, didn‚Äôt drink at all (except maybe a glass of wine or two). I feel like I‚Äôll be missing out if I don‚Äôt have at least one ‚Äúnight out‚Äù. I also wonder, haven‚Äôt I earned at least one night? Just one night to ‚Äúlive a little‚Äù, especially while I‚Äôm on vacation? But then, I also know exactly how that could turn out. And history shows it won‚Äôt turn out well. 

I should also add that I had a slip recently after 1.25 years of sobriety. I‚Äôm now 2+ weeks back, but  continue to have strong cravings. My depression and anxiety have been bad, but booking this trip, which has given me something to look forward to, has quelled that a bit. It‚Äôs also made me realize that had I not gotten sober for that period of time, I wouldn‚Äôt have had the money for this trip, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to repair the relationships with the family I‚Äôll be visiting, and I wouldn‚Äôt be in what is overall a pretty healthy relationship like the one I have with my partner. 

I have a fantastic sponsor who I plan to talk to about all this. I also go to meetings regularly, and I‚Äôve started to attend church regularly as a way to further explore my relationship with God. I just wish the cravings would go away, or the depression/anxiety that seems to be contributing to those cravings would ease up a bit. I‚Äôm on step four and have been for a little while now. I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I just need to rip the bandaid off and get through with it.

"This time last year, my life changed. In 2019, I quit taking my meds properly (I have Bipolar 2) and went on a year long drinking and drug binge. Fucking whoever. Camming for attention. I had my first arrest Memorial Day weekend for DV and drugs and it made me drink and use even more. Anything to not feel. September 13th I got my second arrest.I had been arrested for a DUI, I had gotten a beating from the cops, and was sitting in a hospital.  My best friend and family found out how much I was drinking and using and were beyond pissed and scared for me. As I was sitting in the hospital, handcuffed and monitored by a cop, I began to think about how bad I was. I was on my way to do something immoral while drinking and using. I thought about all the lies and stealing I had done. I thought of what damaged I was causing to everyone. I was on the verge of losing my daughter and I was probably going to lose my life if I kept going as hard as I was. I decided that day, I was done with it all. No more drinking, no more drugs, no more weed. I started detoxing and went to treatment 3 days later. I started taking my meds regularly. Weekly therapy sessions and IOP. I changed my people, places and things. I joined AA and NA and work the programs to the best of my ability. I've never been this stable in my life. I still have swings but not like I use to. I have my family, I have a solid network of people in recovery, I have my best friend, I have my daughter and I have a great job. Tomorrow, I celebrate a year of sobriety.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Please forgive if this post isn't at the right place here, but everything that happened took place in AA. I am absolutely not trying to criticize AA or anything. I just wanted your take on it, or some advice. 

I'm a 28F, 20 months sober. Since January, I've been had a sponsor who is very nice but doesn't ever seem to reprimand me. She also seems very busy and she often doesn't answer the phone and our stepwork sessions often get cancelled. Sometimes because of her work, sometimes because it's her wedding anniversary etc. To be honest, I don't feel as if I've made that  much progress this year. For the record, I do at least 3 meetings per week and I have 3 service positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then a little while ago, a female fellow/'fella'  called M,  reached out to me. She's 46 years old and nearly 2 years sober. She was primarily in NA but wanted to transfer to AA.  She apparently had the same sponsor, although I didn't know. She too felt very neglected by our sponsor. From what M was telling me, I could make up that she had a problem with pretty much everyone in NA. She was also telling me a heck of a lot of gossip about people from the program. I didn't tell her to stop that, which I know is wrong. But it gets worse. At some point, after nearly 2 days of listening to her gossip, I reached to one of the people she'd been gossiping about and told her. I told person X that M had been gossiping about her. X was obviously furious and called M up. M then apparently turned the tables and now X has blocked me and from what I've heard, never wants anything to do with me again. M then retaliated and badmouthed me a guy from the program I had been seeing, and about whom I had complained to her. Technically, I gossiped about him too, which wasn't very nice of me. So now that guy has blocked me too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's my fault that I told person X that M had been gossiping about her. No clue why I did it. Certainly not spiritual of me to do. If I hadn't done that, M wouldn't have retaliated.  Now my sponsor basically lost it too. Not sure what to do here. Yeah, I guess the standard AA answer would be to look at my own part and make amends. But at this point, I just wanna leave.

"Good Afternoon- 

I have 10 months sober after a relapse of six years sober and am on step 9, but my resentments regarding my sexual relationship with my wife of 25 years resurfaced so I reworked it and saw where I was wrong and being selfish. I was able to put this resentment behind me again. It burns me open when it‚Äôs present.  I See things through her eyes and that she has struggles being she was molested as a child.  (Dead bedroom  is past 5 years as she has realized her sexual abuse has effected her more then she has thought).    Not dead but one sided towards my pleasure and I long to give her pleasure).  I am past the resentment again and we do have sex but it‚Äôs rushed and it‚Äôs one sided towards my pleasure.  I haven‚Äôt been able to give her an orgasm in 2 years plus, but she sees a counselor weekly and is working on it.  I can‚Äôt touch her in certain areas and it‚Äôs always the same hurry up and get it over and about my pleasure.  Bet that sounds like nothing but resentment :) 

Now I don‚Äôt force her and really try not to pressure her but I am sure some or my advances are pressure like although they are playful and gentle. 


So she is the one to always initiate and I think it‚Äôs because she feels like she has to and at times it‚Äôs because she wants to make me happy.   But isn‚Äôt that having sex for my own selfish sexual needs? If the other person has no interest in Sex isn‚Äôt that me having sex for my own selfish needs?   

It says in the big book to work toward your ideal sexual partner through prayer for the right ideal, to question each situation and pray for strength to do the right thing.   If that doesn‚Äôt work we help others to over come the urge.  

Well my ideal sexual partner is someone that is just as interested in receiving sexual pleasure as giving it and can be open to the spirituality and curiosity of sex.   Not sure if this will ever happen again. We are in marriage counseling 3 years and little change on the intimacy front.   

So I struggle with my own selfish needs even when she initiated and my ideal sexual partner.  Big book seams to be real vague in this regard.   

So if I am suppose to strive towards my  ideal sexual partner but how is that possible when the other person isn‚Äôt interested.   I really struggle with own selfish needs and being able to express myself sexually with a open and willing partner.

I maybe drink once a year now so our habits are very different and I sometimes feel like I'm overreacting. He has always gone to excess when drinking since I've known him although it's not everyday. On his birthday he got wasted and ended up sleeping under a bridge while the people he was with went home. He drinks and drives frequently. He says he's great because he handles alcohol so well compared to others. Lately he has tried drinking before I got in the car and I said I didn't agree with that so I wouldn't go with him if he did. He got annoyed and justified his freedom. Now he's been hiding it and I got in the car unknowingly when he had been drinking in the morning. Are these valid concerns for addiction?

Sobriety is hard. But it's a lot easier than being a drunk. My favourite slogan as I said it before I knew it was an AA slogan is, ""Even my worst day sober is better than my best day drunk.""

Now, if you have done the steps all the way to step 12 than I can see doing the 90 meetings because you'll actually be sharing and giving and that's what this program is about. 

But this idea that 90 meetings is going to do anything for a new person is baffling to me. They are sick, and are probably going to be burned out after week 1. All of this is just my take on it, I'd like to hear what others takes on it are. Especially from people who are sponsoring.

"REPAIRING THE DAMAGE

Good judgment, a careful sense of timing, courage and prudence - these are the qualities we shall need when we take Step Nine.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 83

To make amends can be viewed two ways: first, that of repairing damage, for if I have damaged my neighbor's fence, I 'make a mend', and that is a direct amend; the second way is by modifying my behavior, for if my actions have harmed someone, I make a daily effort to cause no further harm.  I 'mend my ways', and that is an indirect amend.  Which is the best approach?  The only right approach, provided that I am causing no further harm in so doing, is to do both.  If harm is done, then I simply 'mend my ways.'  To take action in this manner assures me of making honest amends.

(basically getting cussed out and forced to do another persons work for a whole week). they skim 25% off of your paycheck each week. they claim that outside AA meetings are bullshit and only go to outside AA meetings to recruit and ‚Äúgather information.‚Äù then they go back to their home group and literally have meetings that make fun of the outside meeting. they say that if you leave you will drink and die; and that‚Äôs how they get you to stay, out of fear (like all cults). they make you cut ties with family and friends. they told one guy i know to quit his job and get rid of his dog if he actually wanted to stay sober. they don‚Äôt approve of any medications either. i know people that have told me people have died in their care because they were overseeing ‚Äúdetoxes‚Äù which is so dangerous. people have killed themselves because complete abandon forced them to get off of their psychiatric medication, claiming that ‚Äúthe group will cure you, not meds‚Äù. it‚Äôs so wrong. this crazy stuff all happens gradually over time, initially they are very convincing and kind, but really it‚Äôs just to recruit more members.

"Hi--gonna just put this all out and would love some feedback.

I partied hard in college, but no harder than anyone else.

After a few years out I realized I was still drinking socially and ocassionally after a workday eventhough it just numbed my emotions and made things worse.

I mean like I would drink 1-2 drinks a week, and possibly 5-6 on a night out. In college those numbers were 3-4 week and 7-8 on an ocasional night out.

Never blacked out, never been in trouble, never hid my drinking, though I have made some dumb choices when drunk.

After a while alcohol stopped agreeing with me. So I decided to stop. I notice that it's challenging, that my friends pressure me, and that alcohol is actually a very common thing around my life. I associate it with fun and it's hard to have fun without it.

I realized it was challenging to stop, so I decided to go to 2 AA meetings this weekend.

The stories I heard were so terrible, the amount of alcohol so drastic, that I really felt like I didn't belong.

Is AA for alcoholics or for anyone who simply wants to stop drinking? I really feel I don't belong. I'm confused about what support system I can have. Any advice? Anyone here a moderate drinker who found success with AA?",alcoholicsanonymous

It's the long term that gets me I can stop for a couple of weeks no problem it's then when it starts calling me and I start thinking about it all the time. I know I need to replace my drinking with something productive I'm just not sure what. I guess I'm just posting this to get it out see it hoping that this time I can kick it for good. Thanks for listening,alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi All, 
I am really struggling to accept the fact that my ex won't even acknowledge my amends request- he is completely avoiding and blocking me since breaking up in active addiction. I am over a year sober now. He has withdrawn from most people and his parents still contact me every now and again. I just don't understand why he'd block me and refuse to talk to me for so long. I know I'm probably in the wrong, but I just can't understand why he continues to prolong the pain for both of us(we never had the chance to discuss our break up, it just all ended over the phone one night, obviously largely due to my drinking- the way we broke up and why we broke up +the endless fighting around it). It's just incredibly painful for me because he's leaving me hanging and the few times we have spoke, he has sent me mixed messages saying we will talk again etc etc, but then he blocks me out of the blue for months on end again. I don't know it's just all very emotionally confusing to me. I don't understand why he can't just acknowledge the amends I sent him or just rather lay it on me RE why he is angry at me instead of giving me the silent treatment and no closure.

Any tips on how to handle and accept this? Acceptance RE a bad reaction or no reaction to an amends or extreme unforgiveness when you've worked your ass off on repairing your life and relationships and being better. It just gets really really discouraging. 

PS I know amends is about owning responsibility for your actions etc but I'm sure everyone has felt that hurt deep down of someone not accepting it- even if it is not about you and a selfless act. 

Thanks!",alcoholicsanonymous

"This is my first time posting. Earlier this year I saw a PCP for the first time in a couple years and a few months ago I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease due to slightly high liver numbers. The doctor told me to stop drinking, but I haven't. I'm 30 years old and never really considered myself an alcoholic, but I do have a really bad history of binge drinking on weekends. Definitely less since this news. I would say the last few years I averaged a couple beers here and there a few week nights and then like 4-8 one day of the weekend. Covid definitely slowed my drinking down because I have a hard time not drinking in social settings.

I had a follow up a few weeks ago and they had a student doctor come in and she started asking me questions about my drinking. I was very honest. She asked me how many times I've blacked out in the last few years and I started crying because I couldn't answer since it's more than I can remember. She then encouraged I look into alcoholics anonymous, which caught me off guard. I thought this was just a follow up appointment to pat me on the back for losing 15 lbs since my last appointment. The doctor eventually came in and had a real tough love conversation with me, telling me I need to stop for my health and because I'm going to become a dad in about a month. She said my fatty liver was likely the type caused by alcohol.

I left wondering if doctors recommend AA for anyone who admits to drinking regularly or if it was because I'm going to be a dad. My liver numbers have gone down, so I also have been wondering if the fatty liver was the doctor being dramatic. She did say it was not severe. My partner was shocked when I told her what the doctor said about AA. (Obviously being pregnant she doesn't drink but she's never been a big drinker either.) My best friend also told me I'm not an alcoholic, but I would say she's part of the problem, because I can't remember the last time I've hung out with friends and not drank.

I haven't told friends and I've had a few social outings where I was drinking since that appointment. Labor weekend I tried to replace the beers with an edible, but I still ended up drinking. When I drank I asked friends that were leaving to take all my beer and they said ""we'll just come drink and watch football soon"". I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should stop all together. Should I attend a meeting? I feel like I want to make a change before becoming a dad.

Sorry for rambling. My mind was racing and I'm shaking while writing this. I don't know what I'm looking for.",alcoholicsanonymous
"My name is D and I'm an alcoholic. Today is Day 40. I have a sponsor and I'm on step 5. I was at a meeting this morning doing my commitment work, and at some point the thought started to race in my head: a pint would be nice, and I have a few hours to pass out before I have to be anywhere. It was 830 and I don't need to be anywhere until 3. So its almost 12 now, and I'm still here turning this stupid thought... maybe not today, maybe tomorrow... 


ANYWAYS, I already called my sponsor but she didn't answer so I sent her a text. I already said the 3rd step prayer and the serenity prayer a dozen times. I haven't texted anyone else from the program, but I just wanted to put it out there because if I keep it in then I'll definitely drink. 

I'm going to another meeting in a couple hours. Thanks for letting me share üòäüíõ‚úå",alcoholicsanonymous
"I suppose admitting it is the first step. I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve been drinking off and on since about middle school. I‚Äôve had my fair share of issues in what brought me to where I am today within the consistency of my current daily binge drinking but it started out as my pallet for beer grew, I‚Äôm not one for hard liquor but I‚Äôd drink that too if I really feel like I need to get my head change going. It‚Äôs not been consistent in which I drink up to a 6-10 pack a day for about a couple months now, there used to be days I wouldn‚Äôt drink at all but now my thoughts are wondering when I‚Äôm going to grab a beer when I‚Äôve yet to have one, that‚Äôs where things became kind of alarming to me. I feel like there‚Äôs no where I can talk about this without making my girlfriend nervous or even my family which I don‚Äôt speak to so often and are chaotic drinkers themselves, therefore, they cannot practice what they preach. It‚Äôs come to a point where I have to say this somewhere to someone in order for me to get over my struggle of wanting to drink out of stress, pleasure, and the pallet cleanse of 10% triple IPA‚Äôs.

"So my parents are visiting me, and yesterday we had some fun by the pool at their hotel. I ended up drinking a couple beers, and then my family ended up going to the casino. I had some more beers there. My wife called me to say hello and I was pretty lit when she called. I told her I‚Äôd only had 2 beers. Idk why I lied. Then my friends came out to get me. We drank so much. I fell asleep in my hotel room late last night. Around 4am. When I woke up to my wife calling me, I had to be honest and tell her I drank a lot last night, and I was sorry I missed her calls this morning. 

I don‚Äôt want to lie to my wife like that again. And now it‚Äôs my parents last day here, and I‚Äôm hungover and wasted half the day. I mean wtf is that? What am I doing? I have no control over myself when one beer touches my lips. 

I feel so bad. So much guilt. Why do I do this? Why do I lie when I drink? It always feels like when I‚Äôm drunk all my cares and responsibility go out the window. I get this ‚Äúyou only live once‚Äù mentality. And the next day I just feel so guilty! Why do I do this?",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi guys My name is Doug I'm an alcoholic. I'm 33 and drank daily for probly 10 years. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety even before alcohol as a kid. I am 4 months sober but am still on a fairly low dose of valium. In the past 7 years My mother Died at 52 of colon cancer, I lost my eye in a work accident and couldn't work for 5 years and my father is in the late stages of alzheimers at 63. For these reasons I went down the rabbit hole of alcohol, antidepressants that never seemed to work untill finally my psychiatrist said just to make it through I should consider daily valium instead of as needed. I take 7.5 mg a day 2.5mg morning and 5mg at night. I recently had to stop welbutrin due to allergic reaction and stopped mirtazipine due to tiredness after 4 years on it. My problem is my brain. Is complete mush. I can't concentrate, my memory seems shot and I am depressed. My psychiatrist has knows me since 14 and said that this could be that my brain is still recovering from the drinking and may take longer than 4 months. We are going to taper valium slowly as I've been on it around 2 years daily. My question is has anyone been here? I'm worried my brain won't heal if I'm taking the valium but psychiatrist said it very low dose and safer than alcohol as far as brain damage. I exercises daily and eat well. But my brain feels like absolute shit. I'm working as a civil engineer and by lunch I can't focus anymore. Any hope or advice would be great.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hello, friends. My name is David and I'm a grateful alcoholic. I just wanted to put a quick post on this sub to celebrate the programme of AA, my home group, and my AA family and express my incredible gratitude to AA for my sobriety and my new way of life. I came to AA a broken and bankrupt (financially, morally, emotionally) person. Seven years on, I'm growing into the person I feel I was meant to be, living honestly and with integrity. 

If you're struggling with alcoholism or drug addiction, please don't lose hope! There is a way up and a way out of the cesspool of addiction; happiness is available! It works. It really does. 

""To watch people recover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness vanish, to see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host of friends - this is an experience you must not miss. We know you will not want to miss it. Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.""

"I AM RESPONSIBLE

For the readiness to take the full consequences of our past acts, and to take responsibility for the well-being of others at the same time, is the very spirit of Step Nine.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 87

In recovery, and through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, I learn that the very thing I fear is my freedom.  It comes from my tendency to recoil from taking responsibility for anything: I deny, I ignore, I blame, I avoid.  Then one day, I look, I admit, I accept.  The freedom, the healing and the recovery I experience is in the looking, admitting and accepting.  I learn to say, 'Yes, I am responsible.'  When I can speak those words with honesty and sincerity, then I am free.

"I‚Äôve been reading some of the threads and it seems like there is a lot of discussion about CBD for anxiety and some about pain, but not a lot on sleep. So I thought I would post.

I have narcolepsy and I‚Äôve been waking a lot during the night recently (plus, I‚Äôm getting older, which doesn‚Äôt help). This is typical of narcolepsy and just adds to the problem of not getting any slow wave sleep. (Quick lesson on narcolepsy - narcoleptics spend little to no time in slow wave, which is the restorative sleep you need. That‚Äôs why most of us are tired - literally- all the time.)

I‚Äôm thinking about trying CBD at bedtime because I have read that it is beneficial for narcoleptics. But, well, it‚Äôs CBD and I know it‚Äôs controversial. I will talk to my sponsor and close friends in the program, as well as my psychiatrist. In my mind, it is probably a better choice than ambien and other sleep aids.

"I want to keep this short and sweet but appreciate any advice there is. 

Backstory: I‚Äôm 30 years old and have effectively drank since college when I was 19. Not casually, but most days of my 20‚Äôs were spent drunk. Did I have hobbies? Hell yeah I did. Did I try to figure out how to have hobbies that allowed me to drink (golf, woodworking, rock climbing, etc)? Hell yeah I did and do. I have drank (roughly) a 15 pack a day. I have always been able to maintain my life (bachelors degree, emt school, paramedic school, and working full time jobs as a medic and wildland firefighter). I don‚Äôt have the shakes or anything like that. But on my days off I would drink that 15 pack or drive buzzed to get more. Now that I started my own business and have free time up the ass, I am drinking far more than that. The shitty part is I feel normal. Obviously I know I have a problem, but the whole ‚Äúthe first step is admitting it‚Äù has never been an issue for me. I have said it for years, like I‚Äôm almost waiting for someone to coach me lol (which I know is me diverting blame). I honestly just don‚Äôt know how to get past this first step that I‚Äôve been cool with for over a decade. I‚Äôm still functional but I want my 1 year old son (I don‚Äôt drive intoxicated with him ever, that‚Äôs my one rule) to know his dad as not a piece of shit. I just don‚Äôt know how to kick this fucking habit. Any advice or judgment is welcome.",alcoholicsanonymous
"So as part of my job I am required to move around project sites. I spent 5 long years on one particular job site and it became a very toxic environment for me. My health deteriorated and my spiral into alcoholism was deep and painful. Coupled with a new baby in the house I finally lost my way just over 3 years ago, and my mental health and extensive drinking made me reach my bottom. I reached out to a fellow member and he took me into AA and 3 years later (7th Sept was my 3 years) I am still clean and sober and my mental health is vastly improved. 

Then recently I was asked to head back to that project site to help dig the Company out of a hole. I‚Äôve fast tracked in my career in the last 3 years being away from the booze and now head up our Companies sector that this project falls under. So when I was asked it wasn‚Äôt much of a choice, I have the most experience and I know the project. But I made it clear I couldn‚Äôt do full time, knowing that it had the potential to not be a good place for me mentally. A couple days a week max as I have other things running alongside which I want to concentrate on. However to start with they needed me full time. As a colleague is away for 3 weeks. 

I am now a week in and I cannot tell you how much of a trigger this place has been for me. It‚Äôs like stepping back in time. Like I never left and my mental health has begun to already feel the anguish this place has associated to it for me. The memories of the things I did and the countless lunchtimes and nights spent drinking my pain away in the local hotel bars, being days away from losing my family. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I want to drink, I know where that leads. But the triggers feel so real and powerful that it does scare me what could unfold. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for a way to compartmentalise the past period spent here vs now. How do I make it a different beast so that it doesn‚Äôt lead me into a similar path. Getting off the project now isn‚Äôt an option, I‚Äôm months away from getting my shot at Director so this is partially political so I have to suck it up. Just worried it has the potential to damage everything I‚Äôve worked for these last 3 years. 

Albeit I know it‚Äôs just another test sent my way, of which I must overcome.   Just wondered if anyone had experienced similar and any methods they used to separate the history from the reality. 

Thanks all.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hello everybody,

I was somewhat wondering if this was the right place to post. I would never call myself an alcoholic but I did have a period in my life 4-5 years ago where I was self-medicating at work. Basically when going out for lunch with co-workers I would have a sip of whisky or vodka to be relaxed. Basically social situations made me really anxious. Had about 2 shots. So I was never really hung over and I could easily keep working. Didn't harm anybody and nothing. Didn't really impair my ability to function at work. (slithgly maybe)

I'm currently in therapy and try to adress the root causes of my problems which ... seem to have to do with shame, social anxiety as I mentioned and a strong inferiority complex and I guess a lack of validation from my father when I was a child &amp; teenager... parents fighting a lot. I was bullied, etc.

Now I know drinking at work is not strictly forbidden in some countries like the US but in my country it is forbidden and there is a chance I would have lost my job if somebody found out.

Now I have all this old shame and incredible guilt coming up as well as this strong feeling in my body that I have to hide something ... from my co-workers ... from my parents. They don't know and they never will because it would only drive my shame / inferiority feelings even higher. I thought I forgave myself but it seems my nervous system thinks otherwise. I have just had a lot of dreams from back then come up ... where I was trying to keep my secret ... trying to hide ... trying to keep people from seeing what I did there.

# My question:

Do you have any recommendations how to deal with this very strong feelings of shame and guilt about what I did? It feels like I did something really bad. It feels like this feeling of having to hide something is still locked in my body. I feel like I have to wear a mask whenever I see co-workers.

Ofc it doesn't help that it's shame which started all this. ... It feels like a vicious cycle.

Any ideas?

Thx a lot!",alcoholicsanonymous

"Over the last 2 years after a serious breakup, I have drank almost every single day just to be able to go to bed, because the stress has kept me awake at night and I honestly have not found anything better that helps me sleep.  Tonight was really the kicker, my girlfriend asked me why I was buying another bottle when I had just bought one earlier this week.  Then she commented I had already killed had of it, and I replied, oh it‚Äôs prolly only a third, this was 2 hours ago, and I‚Äôm definitely over half the bottle now and still can‚Äôt sleep.  I think it honestly stems from when my ex made the comment I didn‚Äôt last very long in bed, and honestly without drinking I most likely do have pre mature ejaculation, but it seriously fucked my head up so much I started drinking so often that it really soured the relationship that I honestly thought was gonna last for a long time.  Coming to terms with all that I realize it was honestly toxic, but I‚Äôve kept up the drinking and I honestly feel like it‚Äôs at a point where it may affect my current relationship and I have no idea how to stop it.  I can buy a bottle every other day and put it down like it‚Äôs water, and I just wrote it off like, hey it‚Äôs gonna help me sleep tonight, but it‚Äôs so ingrained in my head because me entire family is full of alcoholics, it just feels like a natural response, like taking a breath.  I know it‚Äôs not a normal behavior, but my brain also tells me it‚Äôs not a serious thing, even though I know it‚Äôs not.  Do you guys have any advice on how to get out of this vicious cycle?  I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind every day, I go to work for 6 days a week, and if I realize I can‚Äôt drink when I get home I go and get a bottle, and the.

"I do care for her deeply but I am insecure in my shares, shss unbiased and invested. She doesn't allow her emotions to run her guidance and she allows me to create an entire program of my own and encourages my thoughts and ideas. She is an incredible blessing to my life. That being said, I feel like she's become very busy with school, work and dating. I am really needing support right now and she just seems to busy to be bothered. I did call her out on this, a week ago but I feel my reaching out still isn't quite being met. I do not want to be selfish of emotional. I am aware that my program is my responsibility but I would really like to voice my accountability right now on my 9th step and I feel really unmotivated moving forward, without feedback. Her opinion is important to me, and I love that our relationship is NOT codependent, as most of the relationships in my waking life are and I see my moral defects much more spritly in those bonds. My worry is if I express this again, it will seem codependent, annoying, or defensive. I have been eyeing the idea of piecing some program and step related things together with other women from different groups. I am worried though that my tendency to seek codependency; is just me looking for an excuse to also loosen my effort, and find someone I can manipulate into telling me how to work my program rather than encouraging me to do the steps, as she does. I do feel very valid that my struggle is not being met and that I am frustrated. I am really trying to measure a healthy answer here. I know firing her probably is not the correct answer but the idea of creating a commotion because I am not getting the attentiveness I'd like, seems so very much like making an ass of my skills and tool that I'm supposed to have learned to navigate independently by now.  I am insecure in our relationship right now. I feel like if I express it a second time it might push her away farther because I'm being self important? Am I acting of self importance? I really really don't know what to do guys.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hello,

I am looking for advice regarding persistent symptoms as a result of a single binge drinking session I had, alone, the other night. **I want to know whether it is likely or unlikely (in your estimate) that I received neurological damage due to an alcohol overdose from an event of which I will outline for you.**

**Facts about me:** 19 years old, skinny, fast metabolism, **non-drinker** (very rarely! I have binge-drunk before - maybe a couple of years ago -  and have not received any persistent impairment before excluding a temporary hangover)

**Incident:** This took place on **Monday 6th September (The persistent nature of the symptoms has urged me to consult Reddit). It has been nearly a whole week since the drinking binge.**

I drunk around five coffee mugs *only 2/5ths full* of vodka over a **3-4 hour period**. Then I fell asleep (I am pretty sure I did not pass out) and slept for around 12-15 hours (I usually sleep only 6-7 hours per night).

**NOTE: I had eaten earlier but sparsely. Also, I did not hydrate with water during drinking the vodka / (obviously) whilst sleeping.** 

**Results:** So, it must be noted that I have had pretty severe and persistent mental illnesses for many years. Of late, I have been particularly dissociative / potentially delusional - so, please factor this into your advice / decision whether or not I could have received more than temporary neurological damage from the single binge-drinking night. Consequently, the potentiality exists that, as my mental illness has been more extreme of late, I am psychosomatically imposing the symptoms which I will outline for you. That is, they may be psychological rather than neurological. Or, they may be a bit of both. So what are the symptoms? Well - and this is where the potential for self-delusion comes in as I am pretty sure one cannot feel the exact region of neurological damage as the brain has no nerve receptors - I am experiencing a strange tingling / emptiness in the left side of my brain. Only the left side, however. I  noticed the feeling only after I got through the hangover (which last but a day). Then, upon self-analysis, I realised that my inner dialogue / personality feels much more muted / dull. 

So, here ultimately are my symptoms:

(1) Strange, tingly, empty sensation persistent in the left-side of my brain (Only the left-side. It feels as if I can feel the damage, the now vacuous place where once were healthy brain cells)

(2) Muted,  dulled personality / inner mental activity

**!!! HOWEVER, I COMPLETELY ACCEPT THIS WHOLE ORDEAL MAY BE SELF-WILLED. I DID NOT EVEN DRINK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF VODKA. ONLY 5 MUGS WHICH WERE ONLY 2/5THS FULL. YET, THIS IS STILL WAY OVER THE INTERNATIONALLY-ADVISED LIMIT FOR ALL PEOPLE, ALL AGES. ALSO, THIS WAS ONE OCCASION. I HAVE NOT DONE THIS LONG TERM. I DRINK VERY RARELY. THIS WAS ONE BIG MISTAKE.** 

So, is it likely / unlikely that I damaged my brain?

If the symptoms persist, I will be consulting a doctor.

However, I am also afraid that it may be 60% self-willed. As I said, I have been suffering with more mental health (psychological) recently. So, I don't trust myself to accurately assay the symptoms I am feeling and whether/whether not they are a result of my single 4-hour alcohol binge.",alcoholicsanonymous

" I'll admit a few times in the past when I was trying to quit, I drank again just because I was attached to my wine glasses. I know that sounds absolutely nuts but it's the truth. I have two sets of expensive wine glasses and for awhile I was known for carrying a glass of red wine to social events with me as an accessory.

I have 3 60oz growlers too. What are some things you did with your alcohol-specific glassware? Been trying to think of ways to repurpose them in some way but I feel tense every time I think about it

"I just sat on a 12 step call. I have just over one year sober, and I went with a gentleman that has 20 years. I barely know the gentleman except seeing him at a few meetings. I was suggested to assist by a mutual acquaintance. 

&amp;#x200B;

We met with a gentleman that was not so much intoxicated but rather was drinking to prevent DT‚Äôs. He appeared of the hopeless variety as described in the book ‚ÄúAlcoholics Anonymous‚Äù. This gentleman said he has short bouts of ‚Äúsobriety‚Äù followed by longer bouts of daily drinking, non-stop drinking. He said God isn‚Äôt real. That no God would save him. That he was happy it worked for us but that it would never work for him.

My thought, as a man with 1 year clean, was that ‚Äúif he doesn‚Äôt want it, we can‚Äôt force it.‚Äù My partner (the gentleman with 20 years) didn‚Äôt flinch. As our drunk friend wallowed, Mr. 20 years all of a sudden just said he‚Äôs ‚Äùdone with the bullshit. Let me ask you some questions‚Äù. What I experienced next is I can only describe as an intense spiritual experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. 20 years asks: ‚ÄúWhen you drink, do you have the inability to stop when you plan on stopping?‚Äù

The man replies: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Mr. 20 years: ‚Äúok so that by definition means your an alcoholic. Do you accept that?‚Äù

The man replies: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù (He‚Äôs crying by now)

Mr. 20 years: ‚ÄúDo you believe, that if a power that was greater than you existed, that it could restore you?‚Äù

The man replies: ‚ÄùI don‚Äôt believe in God.‚Äù

Mr. 20 years: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask if you believe in God. I asked if there was a God, do you believe that it, whatever the fuck you want it to be, that it could restore you to sanity as it has myself and this man (Me)?‚Äù

The man replies: ‚ÄúYea, I guess.‚Äù

Mr. 20 years: ‚ÄúOk that‚Äôs good enough. Now get on your knees. You‚Äôre going to pray with me. I want you to say these EXACT words as I say them.‚Äú (He then recites the 3rd step prayer, 1 sentence at a time so that the man can reply).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\* At this point, is where it happened. I don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks. The mans face went from white to color, like the blood came back. I felt willingness in him, from him. I was out of my body as I sat observing all of this.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Mr. 20 years pulls out a notebook: ‚Äú Ok, here‚Äôs a notebook and a pen. I want you to make 3 lines going up and down. Now we work up to down, not across ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶(obviously he‚Äôs beginning to do the 4th step).‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Now after this point details don‚Äôt matter, Mr. 20 years showed him the basics of a 4th step, he told this helpless man that he was coming over in 24 hours to check on him blah blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT THIS IS THE POINT OF THE POST:

I have never experienced someone just trudge through the first 4 steps (I guess just 3 steps because the man didn‚Äôt actually write an inventory)  in 10-15 minutes, let alone with someone still smelling of alcohol.

After, I asked Mr. 20 years: ‚ÄúDo you do this with everyone?‚Äù 

Mr. 20 years replied: ‚ÄúNo, only to people that are about to drink when I leave. And it‚Äôs never not worked.‚Äù

We had some discussions, and Mr. 20 years shared what he believed was the truth.

1. AA is currently a mockery of what Bill and Bob created. Anyone that doesn‚Äôt do the 12 steps as suggested in the Big Book is not doing AA. They are doing something, but not AA. The 12 steps are the only program of recovery according to the Big Book, and a spiritual awakening is the only result of working the 12 steps.
2. Bill W. And Dr. Bob S. Would roll in their graves if they saw what AA has become. In the chapter ‚ÄúBills Story‚Äù, Bill goes through the steps (not yet steps)  with Ebby by meeting with Ebby 3 times (@ Bills house; @ bills house; @ hospital). Bill instantly then carries his message. In the story ‚ÄúHe Sold Himself Short‚Äù (page 263 of the 4th edition of Alcoholics Anonymous) the narrator (Earl T.) describes meeting Dr. Bob in Akron where Dr. Bob takes him through the Six-Step program (still not the 12 steps that we know) in ‚Äúthree or four hours‚Äú.

My revelation, which might not be a revelation, is that AA as we know it has diverged from what it was. I believe that success in AA has dwindled from 93% at the Akron Group to approximately 3%-7% in general because there is an emphasis on slogans (easy does it; one day at a time) and meetings, which was never the intention. The original intention was to find a ‚Äùdrunk‚Äù, push him through the 12 steps as quick as possible, and send him out to save others. We don‚Äôt see this. I hear ‚Äúold timers‚Äù that if I didn‚Äôt know better were newcomers from the content of their shares. I hear someone with 16 years say ‚Äúmeetings meetings meetings‚Äù and then goes on for 5 minutes taking other peoples inventory. I don‚Äôt hear ‚ÄúExperience Strength and Hope.‚Äù  I hear ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sober 18 months and am still working on my 4th step‚Äù which to me sounds like an easier softer way. And it‚Äôs no body‚Äôs fault. They were taught this by their sponsor, who learned it from their sponsor. But its killing people. Seriously. I was 7 years sober, taking my time as my sponsor suggeested, cut back to 1 meeting a week where I aired my grievances: AND ALL I WANTED WAS TO PUT A GUN IN MY MOUTH. I now realize Why. I wasn‚Äôt practicing the principles in all my affairs and I was taught not to! What we take as AA is really just group therapy. People talking about their day. No hope. No commitment to share the gift with the newcomer. Just a friendly ‚ÄúKeep Coming Back‚Äù Or ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt drink‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry. I suffer form a disease that is trying to kill me. It either wants me to die by the bottle or by the gun. Am I crazy? Am I the only one that sees this (well and apparently Mr. 20 years)",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi, i'm Alexandre, 23yo in less than a month and I have a problem with alcohol.

I began to drink a beer everyday maybe 1y ago just because i like beer. But now it's worse, I just want to get drunk so I can ""be happy"". Alcohol is something that let me enjoy the moment, I suffer from depression for around 5y now and I feel that it's the only way I can just not think about it. I don't know, my emotions just ""explode"" when i'm drunk, I have incredible feelings listening to music while drunk and i can just let my emotion out for a moment and it makes me ""happy"".

I have few close friends, i'll graduate in a few weeks and I think my parents love me ? Not sure because i can't really feel this because of my past.

I didn't wanted to tell my friends that I got drunk every night for maybe 3-4 months because i don't want them to judge me or anything (I have trust issues) so why not just writing this on reddit, nobody know me here.

I need help to stop drinking alone I know that, but i don't have enough courage to talk about it face to face.

So yeah, it's hard for me to talk about it and thanks ? I don't really know what to say sorry

"I‚Äôm an alcoholic and I have a desire to stop drinking. I‚Äôm 23 years old and a male. I am alive today because people in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous took me in and showed me a new way of living, and helped me find a Power that is greater than myself.

I think all newcomers should identify as alcoholics regardless of ‚Äúdrug of choice,‚Äù and I think freedom from alcohol and helping others to achieve this is the primary purpose of the entire thing. I also think that many of us are mentally disordered, addicted to other drugs, traumatized, beaten down, and battered. If I was ever told that I needed to go do some more ‚Äúresearch,‚Äù that I was ‚Äútoo young,‚Äù that I could smoke pot or do LSD because it‚Äôs an ‚Äúoutside issue,‚Äù well I probably would‚Äôve done just that as an impressionable newcomer. I owe my life to the old timers who were real with me and accepted me the moment I walked in the door.

"Sometimes I forget what a miracle my sobriety is. To anyone struggling, remember. You can do it. 

And if you slip up or relapse, that's ok. You can quit as many times as you need to. No judgements. It's in our nature to be alcoholics, so naturally there may be relapses.

I have suffered from server anxiety since I can remember and my coping mechanisms have always been destructive. I developed an eating disorder and now, I am doing the same things and following the same destructive patterns as I did a few years ago but this time, with alcohol. I know it is making me sicker and my anxiety worse but I still think I will be okay to have a few swigs of eye watering poison because, no one will know right?

"Archaic shame-based model serves only to make sick people sicker. No qualified staff, with the only requirement to work here being have graduated yourself. Constant victim-shaming, mistreatment and mishandling of residents due to lack of trained specialists (no doctors or psychologists anywhere near here). Ran like an interagation camp that intends to break you in order to retrieve information by overworking you and not allowing for adequate amounts of sleep. Self-fulfilling, if you forget something you get titled a liar, quick to pigeonhole all addicts as terrible people despite their background and real character traits. Stay far away from here. No evidence to support the structure other than the few who stick around after the staff here manages to isolate you from your loved ones. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy, pure trauma bonding. How to develop OCD in 12 months.

I am a college graduate with a bachlors degree in psychology. While this is not much, it is much more than anyone managing this program has to offer.
I fully believe that a program like this should not be used under ANY circumstances. The few times that it does succeed does not justify the hundreds of other times that lead to extensive trauma and/or death of the addict upon leaving this program. Failure to thrive in this setting for a highly impressionable young adult and addict leads to unbearable feelings of failure and guilt, which in most cases results in certain death. The program wants to believe that this is due to the nature of the addict but realistically relapse related death occurs at a higher frequency when compared to other rehab facilities. Below, I will illustrate the core mechanics of the program to the best of my ability.
The core of the program relies on doing daily chores. This involves a revolving weekly chore list. Typically you receive two or three chores. Failure to ""master"" a chore based on the mercy of the house manager leads to repeating the chore or having to do more of the chore. All mistakes lead to extensive repetition in hopes that doing more of the thing you hate will make you better at it. Each chore takes 2 to 3 hours to complete. The chores are exensive to the point of being gratuitous. Upon the completion of a chore, you call for the house leader, who then checks off the chore systematically. Did someone walk through and cause a peice of dust to fly into the floor where you just mopped? Missed a spot drying dishes? Did the house leader find a spot that a speck of dust was not removed? Leave a smudge of windex? That's a ""ding"" If you get three dings on a chore, that's a strike. This is the next core mechanic, that is the strike system. Anything the manager deems to be incorrect can result in a strike. Not following through, defending yourself during dinner, talking at what the manager deems to be the wrong time, people pleasing, are all examples of what can lead to a strike. You are expected to get a fair amount of these. Strikes gain interest depending on how many times the ""offense"" or mistake is made. The next mechanic and core component of this program are words. Strikes result in words that increase depending on frequency of occurrence. These words are a numerical amount that you must write on a subject that the essay monitor (a separate chore) decides. Still, the topics are random and come from the group itself or Google searches. The next core mechanic is ""solutions"". Accruing 1000 words or more on any one strike leads to being put on ""solutions"" here you cannot speak to anyone else but the house leader about program related topics, fidget or bop your head, or stare at the TV for too long. If you perceive that you have been accidently touched by someone on solutions you must say solutions, or be on it. ""Cover pulls"" are another core mechanic in where you must, once daily, correct someone's behavior. This happens in the moment and then must be written down in the form of a ""reality check"" which is a positive and negative about people in the house. This almost always leads to additional strikes.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I am an alcoholic, I do not deny this and I accept this. While in a drunken state I am emotionally open and wish to seek discourse and commune with others, but an unable to due to circumstance. But while sober I am reclusive and shut in, not wanting to speak with anyone about anything.

"I generally go through periods of sobriety followed by drunken debauchery. I'll be sober for a week and then drink, feel horrible, disconnected, sick etc. Leave booze alone for a  bit only to repeat the process over and over and over again. The mental gymnastics my mind will play is staggering after 5 or 6 days without drinking. Last weekend I was snorting lines of coke drinking tequila, up for 2 days straight. The mental anguish drove me to put the drink down once more. I've been sober for 5 days now and this is usually when my endorphins have rehabilitate enough to start with their antics for drink. On my way home I told myself that I was gonna drink, but before I did I called someone from AA and talked on the phone. This is the first time I've reached out in the moment of desire rather than the aftermath of shame. My friend from AA basically told me what I needed to hear. I'm home now drinking sparkling water enjoying the fact that what ever craving I might have had will be gone in the morning. And the shame that I would have had won't be there. It's when nightfall arrives is when the demons come out. During the day I'm fine, it's something I'm starting to figure out. I've  read something about the correlation between during the time of day and the desire to use. I'm just happy to be here one more day sober. It may not be shit in the long run but it means a lot knowing I took a different approach this time. And that I'm starting to get a handle on how my brain tries to control, manipulate and trick me into using. I've begun to say to myself. If you wanna be unhappy, drink. If you wanna be happy don't.

" 

Alcohol has caused my kin and I an immeasurable amount of pain and suffering, even now I am haunted by the transforming shadows of forgotten deeds that I will never truly know. I will forever be the villain in the stories of so many, and from what I hear, for good cause. I've spent a great deal of time attempting to lay these demons to rest so that I may live a happy and fulfilling life. Even now, a voice freshly buried attempts to crawl to the surface as it screams and beckons to me. It wants nothing more then for me to give in to its acrimony of compunction that has long lost any sense of purpose. Evasive, it is, that to simply name it invokes a primoradial sense of discomfort. Say hello to the monster in your closet, shame! I never realized until much later just how much time and energy I'd spent avoiding this simple yet caustic emotion. I think about how much shame and embarrassment contributed to me returning to the behavior that masqueraded so cleverly as the answer. Now I come to find that this perceived solution was the convoluted function of a variable in a very long equation.

Now, using the lens of newly acquired knowledge, and through the power of hindsight, I am able to finally locate the nexus of my addiction. At some point, I felt such an overwhelming amount of shame that I deemed myself a complete failure. I'd simply used too much white-out and it was no longer hiding my mistakes. At least not in a way I found satisfactory; I wanted to hide the mistakes, but it wasn't for anyone else. I wanted to forget, what I really wanted was to throw the whole paper away. The white-out via black-out method I had employed only worked so long as I overwrote my saved data with even worse data. What was more was that it only allowed me to feel okay while engaging in the behavior. I simply couldn't cope with the silliest mistakes, due to my now well understood, insecure attachment style and anxiety.

Later in life I would find myself very lonely, just fired out of a dream job, I really believed I had no future prospects. I was desperate for company, and knew that knowing what I knew about myself, there was no way that was going to happen sober. I was getting trashed daily in an attempt to form a meaningful relationship with a woman, typical behavior for me. I had no standards, and asked a random girl online if she wanted to hang out. We met, she was physically deeply flawed, particularly in the dental category. Still, what she lacked in teeth she made up for with other features and personality, I'd tell myself. She had a big house, a ton of money, a big tv, she was a chef, had a dog, this was perfect. ""I will never need a job, I probably couldn't get and keep one anyway"", I'd tell myself. I'll just pretend to like her for a while, get free shit, then I figured it would die down. Still, despite every red flag I threw at her, every misdeed, she kept moving full-steam ahead. I kept the lie going, I never could be the one to end things.

I'd have to be pretty drunk to trick myself into believing that I was actually enjoying her presence... On the matter of sex however, I had to be practically blacked-out. Even now, I can only actually recall having sex with her a handful of times. During all of this, I had the craziest thought, ""why don't I just marry her and keep the lie going forever, maybe it will stop being a lie"". I went against my moral compass, I even told my parents that were intensely confused but still supportive as always. Anytime they would question the relationship I'd simply tell them that I was happy and that I had finally learned to actually love her. I never course-corrected, I only picked up speed as I looked back at the now completely unrecognizable path I had taken, yup, I was lost alright. I was driven purely by ego and pleasure, only caring about myself.

At some point, I took on a new identity. I embraced all things evil. That is who and what I was, ""I am a bad person"", I said. Once I accepted this now, fact about myself, I was in a freefall. I continued to do increasingly worse things as I used my last terrible thing to justify my next. No one said anything... no one tried to stop me. I still had everything, and due to not having to see my parents, I thought they believed my illusory happy life. My health saw steady decline, I gained 150 lbs, my liver was starting to fail, my skin was destroyed by guttate psoriasis, I fell into an unspeakable depression...this went on for almost 2 years.

She began to take interest in someone at work, I saw it coming from a mile away, she'd finally had enough. I asked my parents to find me a place to live. My parents already had a plan, I'd go to a rehab in California. Like a deeply-embedded parasite being baited by a raw piece of meat, I was afraid, I was angry at the world, but the thought of smoking weed by the ocean had me on a plane the next day. I lost everything in my vicinity, even the dog that I had called mine for 2 years. I didn't actually have ownership of anything. I settled for nothing and in return chose to live a lie so long as the alcohol and drugs kept flowing. I was sent to Awakening Recovery in Beverly Hill's, California. Who knew such a place could exist? All of these rules were thrown at me, I was already dealing with PAW's and this was my first time trying to ""get sober"". Reality hit hard, and this brand was particularly cruel. I spent 26 days at this facility, most of my days were spent in a state of pure horror as I learned about the rules of the house. If you even take a step outside of a room without turning a light on, that's a strike. Strikes mean you have to write words, everything had a rule. Each time from 5:30AM-12AM you were doing choirs or writing words for missing a spot on the dishes. This was in an effort to teach accountability. I was stranded in California, you were not allowed to talk to your parents. I couldn't speak to them unless supervised and would not be given a cell phone or allowed a job for 6 months. I could not speak my native tongue with my parents, I tried to call my dad in the middle of the night in a panic and was punished for it. What was more is, I was being told that I was crazy, my addiction was talking, and my parents said I would not be allowed to return home. I'd have to become homeless in LA. I can still hear the pain in my dads voice as he told me this on the phone. I'd come to find out they had sent him a packet saying that I would try to go home and that I was being manipulative like I always have been. Once my stimulus check hit, it was over, like a computer being powered on. As soon as the decision had been made, I was unshackled, I took the power back and took the biggest leap of faith in my life. I was fairly certain my parents would catch me, but I really didn't know this time. If you decide to leave this facility they simply make you walk out the door and do not help you find arrangements, it's part of the program, its why people stay. People not only have no where to go but they fear their parents may really abandon them in LA out of all places. Knowing I had that stimulus money was enough for me to make the jump, even though it wouldn't realistically have covered the cost of making it back. I left, they do everything they can to start a fight with you before you go, insane. I saw someone get kicked out by the seniors there, every Wednesday, the graduates would come and ""group"" you. Pick out any mistakes you made and tear you apart. I kept trying to call my parents, they refused to speak to me. I found a hostel and really didn't know how much longer I had, I just knew for a fact I was never going back to the Awakening sober living, I would die before being subjugated to some new forms of punishment that they felt like making up.

All of this to say, my whole time in rehab has all served to teach me how absolutely batshit insane the addiction treatment industry is. Eventually, I went to another rehab that had its own set of problems, experienced a HIPAA violation and abuse of all sorts. Still, I did have one good counselor that specialized in trauma. I am a psychology major, so just learning about the therapy was really cool. In all I had over six months completely alcohol free. That is, until I made the conscious decision to drink again. I do not want to count time, this sounds like the perfect excuse to kill yourself on a relapse plus I still believe that I can drink safely and responsibly AFTER having learned everything that I have, mostly on my own. My extensive research on addiction all suggests that treatment centers are doing more harm than good, along with AA's addiction model as being the most harmful development when it comes to addiction. The way that we think about addiction is the problem, and it is all painted by an arbitrary singular brush that is the AA hive-mind. Subsequently, treatment centers think this same way. The fact of the matter is, I made a choice to give up and give in, to take advantage of people, to hurt and kill even, I did this. I have a bottle Bacardi sitting in my freezer right now, I don't want to drink it. I have had it since last Friday, I had exactly 3 shots yesterday night. Nothing less, nothing more. That is what separates those of us who can actually beat this thing and those of us that stay sick or unhappy, doubting themselves forever with the ""disease of alcoholism"". The fact that we can not only talk about ""Accountability"" but actually engage in the act. We do not accept feelings of shame anymore. We accept that we are humans, and that we make the wrong choices, that we are selfish, that we seek pleasure at the cost of others and that humans can be exceptionally cruel but that they can also be amazing, resilient, compassionate, kind, caring, intelligent, and every other good adjective you can think of! We don't need sobriety hierarchy or other ridiculous, quite frankly intellectually insulting methods of group-thinking that takes away the power and the ability to critically think for yourself! If sobriety is different for everyone, act like it!",alcoholicsanonymous
"for context, i also have EDNOS (anorexia with purging).

"I practiced sobriety for 14 months. It‚Äôs been a month and I drink a couple of times a week only having 2-3 drinks out socially, but it‚Äôs enough to feel cus i guess no tolerance. I wake up in the mornings slow and foggy minded. I was listening to something today and she mentioned how our purpose to the world and to god is to be of service to others. And I don‚Äôt know how I can do that when I feel groggy the next morning and not level-headed. 
I feel something in me, whether it‚Äôs god (which I believe is a power within all of us), calling me to stop. But idk if I‚Äôm just making a big deal out of nothing. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm an alcoholic or someone who just doesn‚Äôt connect with drinking anymore spiritually. And step 1 is all about admitting you are an alcoholic. 

I know i want to be sober today, but if I tell myself I‚Äôm going to abstain completely, it feels too limiting. But if I dont, then it feels like I have no accountability around it. So im open to going back to aa but i also don‚Äôt want to waste anyones time if I‚Äôm not planning to do this long term? Lol I cant. why do I make things so complicated?

Someone please be brutally honest with me.

TLDR: I feel called by god to stop. But abstinence feels too limiting, but no abstinence feels like there‚Äôs no accountability around it. Not sure I‚Äôm an alcoholic. Can I go to AA and try this? Or am I wasting time?",alcoholicsanonymous
"This week I reached my one year mark - Alcohol can do some crazy stuff to your mind and it can cause some really deep scars - not only to you - but to the people who love you. 

I have struggled with staying sober for the 13 years. I've made it to the year mark before, twice actually, but each time, it's followed by a horrible relapse that lasts - well as long as I let it. Because of my extended periods of sobriety, I've had family members tell me that I don't actually have a problem. Some even go as far to say that alcoholism isn't a real disease - 

Yesterday my older brother wanted me to join him for lunch to have some margaritas. I told him no thank you, I was working, but he still told me that he doesn't believe that it's a real thing. Oddly enough, he visited me in a rehab facility when I was first getting sober almost 3 years ago. It's hard to fight the urge, especially when drinking is socially acceptable and ""normal"" 

I think the hardest thing is that I feel so alone while getting sober. I have to change a lot about myself and the people I invite in my life. I have trust issues, I don't open up to anyone because I've been burned before. I don't show how much I am actually hurting inside... I don't know how to! Well, I think i'm learning too... slow and steady... progress not perfection... 

Thanks for letting me rant here... Have a good 24 hours",alcoholicsanonymous
"*I like this exert from this story in the Big Book of AA, on page 245.*

&gt;Ninety days sober cleared my thinking enough to make me realize I‚Äôd hit bottom. If I were to go back to drinking, it would be just a matter of time before one of two things happened: I‚Äôd succeed at suicide, or I‚Äôd start the life of the living dead. I‚Äôd seen what the latter looked like, and real death was preferable.   
&gt;  
&gt;At this point I surrendered. I admitted I was an alcoholic without a clue what to do about it. Many of the people around me wanted me to go to treatment, but I resisted. I didn‚Äôt want the kids at school to know what was going on. If I went to treatment, they‚Äôd all know within a week. More importantly, I was afraid. I was afraid the treatment center would test me and say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not an alcoholic. You‚Äôre just crazy.‚Äù My heart knew this wasn‚Äôt true. My head took a bit more convincing. The thought of having A.A. taken away from me was terrifying. A.A. was my anchor in a sea of confusion. Anything that might pose a threat to my sense of security was quickly thrust away. I didn‚Äôt have anything against treatment centers then, nor do I now. I simply didn‚Äôt want to go, and I didn‚Äôt.   
&gt;  
&gt;I did stay sober. One summer with people who enjoyed life sober was all it took for me to want sobriety more than I wanted a drink. I will not tell you I did everything I was told, when I was told, how I was told, because I didn‚Äôt. Like most people new to the program I set out to find an easier, softer way. As the Big Book suggests, I could not....  
&gt;  
&gt;...No one who drank as I did wakes up on the edge of the abyss one morning and says: Things look pretty scary; I think I‚Äôd better stop drinking before I fall in. I was convinced I could go as far as I wanted, and then climb back out when it wasn‚Äôt fun anymore. What happened was, I found myself at the bottom of the canyon thinking I‚Äôd never see the sun again. A.A. didn‚Äôt pull me out of that hole. It did give me the tools to construct a ladder, with Twelve Steps.

How many of you guys got sober in the rooms alone? Or did you do rehab and then go straight to the rooms after?,alcoholicsanonymous
"I got sober in July (ended up in inpatient after a good four/five years of hardcore drug and alcohol abuse) and currently have 49 days clean &amp; sober. My life has improved *so much* since quitting drinking and joining AA. My mood is better, my relationships with others have become more fulfilling, I'm in touch with my spirituality and Higher Power, I go to the gym and have been eating much healthier, I'm motivated to take care of myself and others...for the first time in years, I'm excited to wake up in the morning. I've experienced a lot of trauma in my life and was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and depression, and I've noticed that my anxiety and depression symptoms have been pretty minimal since getting sober. I still get mood swings and anxiety sometimes, but I'm not constantly on-edge. Instead of reaching for the bottle, I use other coping skills to deal with those feelings. I've really embraced the idea that my Higher Power has a plan for me and it's helped a lot with not anxiety-spiraling over things I can't control. 

Here's the catch, I guess: so many people have warned me that I'm just 'in the pink cloud' and that when that dissipates, reality will hit me hard and I'll be at risk of relapsing. Some of these people are sober/in recovery and some aren't. I just feel like I spent almost half a decade numbing myself out and destroying my life/health/relationships with booze and drugs and being sober feels really good.

I‚Äôve just passed three months of sobriety and taken my first step. 
Tomorrow is the two year anniversary of my mother‚Äôs death. We had a complicated relationship, and I still have a lot of feelings about it.

In the past, my brother and I would make plans to get together on this date to drink. We drank so hard, once when my husband drank with us he got acute pancreatitis. The man still doesn‚Äôt drink! He‚Äôs been sober a year and nine months now after acquiring the pancreatitis at my brother‚Äôs birthday. And my mother was the one who introduced me to drinking and drugging. Before I was even interested in mind-altering substances, I watched her trading pills with her sister, my aunt. I‚Äôd later overdose on those pills two separate occasions, before I looked old enough to score booze. My mother gave me my first tastes of many things. Most notably, vodka. She set a partial bottle in front of me one day and said, ‚ÄúRiotreality, you have good, stoic, Ukrainian blood in you. You can finish this vodka.‚Äù I did. Another time I drank so much with my mother and aunt, I crashed my bicycle on my way home. There was always booze around. My mother died a drunk. I don‚Äôt want to, too.

"Hey all. I am a 26 year old male looking for some advice on my alcoholism. This addiction has started to affect my work life as well as my home life. I don‚Äôt usually drink at home, since my wife got pregnant in February. We used to drink like half a fifth everyday at least in college and into our adult lives. Ever since she got pregnant I have been struggling with trying to stop drinking. I appear as though I am not drinking at home, which I am not. Rather, I get a couple shots in before work, then maybe another small 200 ml during work and a couple shots on my way home. I just can‚Äôt handle it anymore. I‚Äôve been sick emotionally and physically with this habit. I have a great job and don‚Äôt want to lose it because of this. Alcoholism tends to run in my family (uncles, aunts, etc.) I just want to be able to quit and be the father I need to be for my son. We have about 7 weeks until he is here. While at home I have no issues not drinking, we can watch tv and do work and stuff and I am fine. But when I leave for work in the morning it‚Äôs almost like I have to have it before I start anything. This happens on the weekends too, I wake up and instantly want a shot or something. I‚Äôve been making up excuses to go buy alcohol in secret and just drink it before my wife knows. I‚Äôm pretty good at getting a buzz then riding it out for awhile. When it fades though I get digestive issues and severe anxiety. I just want to stop but I don‚Äôt know how. I know that I have a problem and I just want it to end. I don‚Äôt want to feel like shit for the rest of my life. I am fine in public, I can go to dinner and have a beer and be just fine without going overboard.

I want to be better for my family and my work. The feeling of a quick buzz can be so nice. ‚ÄúNot having to deal with the stress‚Äù I just need to cut it off.

The Promises talked about in this passage are slowly coming to life for me.  What has given me hope is putting Step Nine into action.  The Step has allowed me to see and set goals for myself in recovery.  Old habits and behaviors die hard.  Working Step Nine enables me to close the door on the drunk I was, and to open new avenues for myself as a sober alcoholic.  Making direct amends is crucial for me.  As I repair relationships and behavior of the past, I am better able to live a sober life!  Although I have some years of sobriety, there are times when the 'old stuff' from the past needs to be taken care of, and Step Nine always works, when I work it.

"Yesterday I celebrated 100 consecutive days of sobriety.

I created a ""Sobriety VLOG"" and I've been posting a video a day to chronicle my journey through sobriety.

I started with day 93.

Day  100's Topics include:  The first time I got drunk and why my parents  allowed it, Lessons Learned and Lessons Lost, and of course My  Giant-Sized Man-Thing.

"So, when I first started a little over two months ago, I attended a local meeting. At the time, the time of this meeting and its location worked for me. The second or third time I went to this meeting, my now sponsor, approached me about working with me and being my sponsor. 

Fast forward to now, and I just can‚Äôt stand this group. The meetings are dank, dour, and depressing. I also got bad vibes from the way the meeting leader spoke to two newcomers in introductions. My Sponsor keeps telling me that I should make this group my home group. Quite frankly, I never want to go to another meeting there again. I meet with my sponsor before another meeting I attend regularly, and we go over the Big Book.

"'WE ASKED HIS PROTECTION'

We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 59

I could not manage my life alone.  I had tried that road and failed.  My 'ultimate sin' dragged me down to the lowest level I have ever reached and, unable even to function, I accepted the fact that I desperately needed help.  I stopped fighting and surrendered entirely to God.  Only then did I start growing!  God forgave me.  A Higher Power had to have saved me, because the doctors doubted that I would survive.  I have forgiven myself now and I enjoy a freedom I have never before experienced.  I've opened my heart and mind to Him.  The more I learn, the less I know - a humbling fact - but I sincerely want to keep growing.  I enjoy serenity, but only when I entrust my life totally to God.  As long as I am honest with myself and ask for His help, I can maintain this rewarding existence.  Just for today, I strive to live His will for me - soberly.  I thank God that today I can choose not to drink.  Today, life is beautiful!

Today is day 700 of me being sober so I'm obviously really close to hitting the 2 year mark which is great previously I'd only managed to string together 98 days. 

Last night my partner went out out, came home super late and was drinking alot which is fine he doesn't have a problem but I do and I felt conflicted. I didn't want him sleeping in the bed next to me smelling of booze so I asked him to sleep in the spare room. He's now freaking out thinking because I felt that way it must mean that I'm plotting my next relapse.

I found out that i am happier when drinking, I love listen to music and drive while drinking as well but once i am sober, music is not that good anymore, driving around seem boring, therefore i kept drinking just to feel something.

This was years ago, I was in my early 20s and could not for the life of me pin down an exact date. But I saw the restaurant and suddenly it all flashed back to me.  


So I called my sponsor for guidance and he suggested that because the details are so vague, sending an anonymous money order with a letter of explanation might be the way to go. Short and simple, direct payment for a debt owed. I drafted a little something but before I proceed I just kind of wanted to hear if anybody has further suggestions or experience with this sort of thing.

"I was recently told by someone from my past that I had hurt them. I did not have a memory of hurting this person, but of course said sorry to them for the harm caused. It was my fault. I have grown from being the person I was then, and wouldn't do what I did today.

The problem I now have is not knowing whether to try to find any other instances in which I hurt people from my past. Like I say, I didn't remember the time I had hurt this person who got in touch with me. It's made me slightly paranoid about other instances in which I may have hurt people and have forgotten about them.

Should I re-engage with people from my past who I no longer see and ask them if I hurt them so that I can apologise? Or should I wait for them to get in touch with me to say sorry? What should I do to move on from this situation?

"I spent much of my teens and 20s spiritually searching. At one point, I lived in a setting similar to a commune where my life was very controlled by fundamentalist religion. When I left, some of my worst drinking happened because I felt betrayed by the religious concept I had.

Today, I still go to (now very well vetted) gurus and similar figures because this is a central aspect of the dharmic religious systems I participate in. But I keep the experience at arm‚Äôs length in a way I didn‚Äôt before.

And yet this isn‚Äôt wholly defensive. I‚Äôve realized that real spirituality has to be a spiritually of one‚Äôs own understanding. And that means spiritual guides can only be that‚Ä¶ guides.

What if a guru was very bad to me? Before I‚Äôd assume God wanted to hurt me by giving me a bad guru or worse, be more zealous. Now? I would just go meditate and try to live spiritually without that person.

God of my own understanding means one no one can take away from me. It means spiritual practice no one can ‚Äúown‚Äù to ‚Äúown me.‚Äù For thousands of years, people have prayed, meditated, journaled and confided in one another. No one owns it ‚Ä¶ and anyone tries to, it doesn‚Äôt invalidate the whole thing.

On the opposite side, I‚Äôve often wondered if material success is all there is and in dark hours, if this makes me just a loser. But by comparing the fruits of materialist life and spiritual life, I have to (perhaps sometimes begrudgingly) nod to the power of spiritual life. I can barely get by but work with many millionaires because I went into financial services. They can be miserable and I can be miserable that I‚Äôm not miserable in their shoes. But at the same time, thousands of monks and nuns from all kinds of traditions around the world wake up in intentional poverty and live happily. As greed sinks this plan into dire crisis again and again, which way is the only way that consistently succeeds? And who is happier, the loner chasing material ends or the people who are serious in meetings, even if they have little to work with themselves? Though it‚Äôs hard to explain why, happy are those whose support does not come from their own effort and who help others along the way.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi all. 

I feel heartbroken and my partner and I haven't officially broke it off. I really don't know what's going to happen. 

He's been with me since I was still drinking and thinking I had it under control but I certainly did not. 

We were supposed to go camping together and spend 5 nights in the woods, no cell reception, just ourselves and the wilderness. 

The day we were supposed to go to his parents to pick up the canoe together he decided to go by himself while I was at work because he's ""not well"" and needed ""solitude"". He texted me this while I was working. I started uncontrollably crying. 

Went home after I finished my shift. Of course my first thought was ""I need a drink"" but as quickly as that thought came in I pushed it out. I talked to my friend who's also in AA and I just remained calm about the situation and started analyzing what he was going through. 

Next day went to visit my friend and we did some therapy shopping and ate some food and hung out. It was a nice distraction. Spent the night and went home the next day. 

He came home the same night as I did only I had already gone to bed before he got home. Figured the conversation could wait till the next day. 

We talked and it was everything I thought. He wants more space and a studio to work out of. Then he brought up how much stress I put him through while drinking. He'd come home and I'd be passed out. Sometimes on the couch in awkward positions. Or snoring loud in bed. He said he'd roll me over and what not. 

He also said he was happy I'm gunna live now. I cried and said I was sorry and that I will not go back. I can't. I won't. I hate alcohol so fucking much. It's taken away so much from me. 

Also he thinks that I forced my moving in with him. He was the one to bring it up and at the time I was struggling hard financially. He said I called him screaming and crying in desperation. 

I was wanting to buy a house with this man and even consider children. He said to me if I noticed that he isn't very nice to me. He never listens to me, we never talk, I feel like I do all the cleaning other than laundry and groceries. I recently started ordering groceries so he wouldn't have to be the one buying all the groceries all the time. Like I've been really trying. I've also lost about 55lbs during the past year and a half. About 25lbs since I stopped drinking. 

He also keeps saying he was ready for all those things before but that I wasn't. And he was scared we would have a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome if we did. But now that isn't even an excuse. 

He asked me if I felt a connection with him? I looked him in the eyes and thought about it and honestly said not always. 

We've had similar conversations in the past but this time I decided to give him space and I am spending a few days at my brothers. I feel like I'm going to insane with my thoughts. 

Before leaving I just asked him to think about whether he wants a future with me or not. 

I feel like I already know the answer. Which is what makes me feel heartbroken. And then the question is what do I do next? 

I feel like such a sad person who is destined to be alone. 

I was starting to think I was becoming a better person, a better girlfriend. 

Sorry for the rant.

The last thing I ever wanted was for my mother to be constantly worried sick about me.. but that comes with being an alcoholic.  You inflict damage on your loved ones.

For the record my sister isn't even doing all that bad.. she's just been sitting around not working living off unemployment and not showing much ambition trying to find a job.. money is getting tight and she's got a family depending on her.

"Hello everyone, I am a 22 year old hardcore alcoholic who has had enough. I‚Äôve done just about every drug in the book but alcohol was the only one that I kept coming back to and by far damaged my life the most (cocaine is a very distant second). I have dabbled in ketamine a bit and I find the after-effects to be nearly as enjoyable as the high itself. As some of you may know it is used medically as a very effective antidepressant, which is primarily why I take it recreationally. The positive effects last for weeks and I usually only do it once every few months.

It's affected my looks, health, social life, marriage and work, and I need help.  I know having something to do makes it effortless to not think about drinking and get to bed normally, but I struggle to not get bored with most things and typically fall asleep drunk 6 nights a week.

"Seperated since end of January. Two kids, one is my step daughter and one is our daughter we share together, she is two. My wife said back in April that she wanted a divorce because I was drinking and doing drugs. I got into AA in January and have been sober since. It has been an amazing journey this far.

 Her whole family has come back into my life and say how well I am doing. This is upsetting her because that's ""her family"". She just recently said she wanted the divorce again when I asked what we were doing. I finally asked if we can work on that process and she said yes. I told her I am sorry for everything that happened, I love her with all my heart, that I'd hate to see us get divorced but I want nothing more than for her to be happy. She read my message but did not respond. When I dropped our daughter off, she had her mom answer the door. 

Does she really want a divorce or is just saying it because she is still hurt? She plans on spending Thanksgiving with a friend out of state. We are both not seeing anyone and it appears that both of our commitments remain to our kids at the moment. As well as my continued commitment to staying sober and being of service.

"Hi all I'm a 19 year old male 6'4 90kg. I've had a problem with alcohol abuse since maybe 15 but didn't start drinking heavily until end of 2019 and 2020. So basically what's happened is last year I suffered with severe social anxiety for a long time and I had signed up for a business course at my local polytechnic but had severe social anxiety all the time in class which made it difficult to learn and get on with work because I'd be swearing, shaking and have to go to the toilet all the time. I also had extremely low self-esteem. But around March 2020 covid struck and lock down occurred so I hit the booze for a couple months I was drinking everyday for months, more traumatic events occurred throughout the year then around November 2020 I ended up loosing quite alot of weight but this wasn't enough to stop me from drinking and around this time I started feeling a bit funny and spaced out/weird but didn't see the connection. Then around December 15th I was involved in a car accident and lost my car. Then continued to drink dispite this, then around January 18th 2021 I woke up one morning 1AM after a binge on 2x bottles of bacardi the days prior and from an extremely frightening nightmare, I woke up drenched in sweat with derealization, memory issues, vertigo, dizzyness, vomiting etc. This to me was when my thiamine must have gotten low. I chalked it up to alcohol withdrawal. But the next day these symptoms were gone. I felt slightly ""off"" everyday and I kept off alcohol for the next 3 weeks until around February 4th - 5th. 

Then around February 4th 2021 I had 1 beer. Then on February 6-8th I had 2x bottles of wine and beer aswell. And I also caught a bad cold at this time. 

Then around February 12th 2021 I woke up one morning and all thr symptoms of the previous time were back and that's when I believe I developed wet brain I went to the ER but failed to tell them about my alcohol use in the past 4 weeks but did tell them about my past heavy drinking for some odd reason and they never thought of it being wernicke-korsakoff but since then things have gotten worse. So at first I had derealization, hypnogogic hallucinations, vivid nightmares everynight, hypnic jerk, diahorrea, abdominal pain in right side, and a couple other things, I also had constant paranoia and OCD tendencies, family seemed unfamiliar and faces seemd frightening I also got this extreme fear I was developing schizophrenia. These symptoms went on for months until around May-June the derealization went away and I started having issues with my memory instead. I also felt like I was having mini stroke episodes and went to the ER for them and got 2x CT scans w/o Contrast both were clear. I also got my thiamine checked on July 13th it was above normal. And I got a bunch of other tests done they were all clear too. 

But as of now today I still have strange symptoms that resemble that of Wernicke-Korsakoff like not being able to remember what I did yesterday this strange wobbly balance feeling when I walk. I feel extremely depressed often, apathy, anhedonia, anxiety, OCD, a bunch of other stuff. I have brainfog all the time my memory is all messed up and I have trouble remembering what happened yesterday and this whole year feels like it was yesterday even though its been 8 months pretty much and also I have trouble accessing my long term memorys so my mind just feels blank 24/7 and I feel spaced out. I will know for certain if it is wernicke-korsakoff as I have an MRI w/ contrast coming up later this month and an E.E.G. I have also been taking high dose oral thiamine 2x per day as well as a plethora of other vitamins daily since July 13th. 

Throught 2020 I also ate a balanced healthy diet too might I add and also took vitamin C daily and oral magnesium in a powder form mixed in with water before bed. And I have been clean from alcohol since February 12th pretty much when all this started I have only drunk on a couple social occasions this year but that's it. So how likely is it I have wernicke-korsakoff? I feel like it may have progressed to wernicke-korsakoff around May/June although I was taking a multi-vitamin since March.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right sub for this.

Which isn‚Äôt true at all! I love him deeply, he‚Äôs the love of my life and he treats me like a princess. He is such a good man, amazing partner. 

I‚Äôve apologized profusely and he says he forgives me, he knows I was just being a drunk idiot. He seems totally okay, thought I know hes good at keeping a poker face on. 

I feel so guilty. I‚Äôm so ashamed and disgusted with myself. This event has actually prompted my prior post regarding starting sobriety. How do I reconcile this with myself? What do I do?",alcoholicsanonymous

Last night I said some downright nasty, mean things to my husband. I front of guests. I am so embarrassed and ashamed and sickened by my behavior. It‚Äôs so easy for me to black out and forget everything and not even know what I‚Äôm doing. Luckily he has forgiven me.. I haven‚Äôt forgiven myself. I don‚Äôt deserve him.

"I thought if I tried counselling I'd get it under control.

I turned up to sessions drunk and eventually stopped going.

I thought if I for the right diagnosis and right meds I'd get it under control.

I drank on the meds anyway.

Lockdown took me to whole new levels where im drunk in work zoom calls, giving presentations to inspire people while being secretly drunk.

I've been¬† getting away with it for years and despite thinking ""oh she enjoys a drink"", no one knows how much I depend on it. Yesterday I haven't felt so depressed in a long time. Nothing in my head, can't move...and I realise I use alcohol for every single emotional (even the good ones) when it gets uncomfortable. It was okay till it wasn't. Now the hangovers leave me so anxious I cant leave the house, I cant even go to the shop because if someone talks to me ill take a panic attack...unless I drink.

I have 6 interviews this week...and in my younger days I'd drink though interviews to perform without fear of a panic attack. Yesterday I looked at 6 of these knowing my body is ill, I threw up on my sofa the night before, and wet myself a few weeks prior. Im not even angry at myself anymore but im so tired of trying to carry this on my back along with what everyone else expects of me.

I couldn't ever see a future without alcohol. Not really. Today is the first time I've seen its not coming from a place of bravery but from a place of sudden brutal honesty. Im an addict. Im an alcoholic. I surrender to it because if I don't ill die.

Really nervous about the meeting. One of the things I struggle with is crying in front of people and I just know its going to happen. Any tips would be great.

Normally I don't cry at all ...like even when I want to. Apparently I have adhd/ ptsd from a violent childhood and docs always put it down to that but every time I think of going to this meeting and accepting what I am its like I cant stop welling up and crying. I dont know what that feeling is. May e shame, maybe grief...I just feel so defeated.",alcoholicsanonymous

I‚Äôm not willing to give up AA or the God of my understanding.

Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation? What happened, and how did it affect you/your sobriety?",alcoholicsanonymous
I feel alone with this struggle. I do think there is a power greater than me ( beyond just the power of the program and our collective strength). But after years in the program I still don‚Äôt trust he/she/it enough to follow through on the third step. Life in sobriety has been hard and full of hard times that have no rhyme or reason.

Step Nine restores in me a feeling of belonging, not only to the human race but also to the everyday world.  First, the Step makes me leave the safety of A.A., so that I may deal with non-A.A. people 'out there', on their terms, not mine.  It is a frightening but necessary action if I am to get back into life.  Second, Step Nine allows me to remove threats to my sobriety by healing past relationships.  Step Nine points the way to a more serene sobriety by letting me clear away past wreckage, lest it bring me down.

"TW: I mention abuse.

Hi, Marilyn, 30, female, alcoholic. 
I just joined this group because I‚Äôm trying the program for a second time. 
I had over a year sober in 2019 but relapsed. I never got into step 4 with my sponsor and never really felt like she understood where I was coming from. I didn‚Äôt feel safe or comfortable getting into the real talk. She never really gave me the opportunity to and made me feel like a lot of people make me feel... Like I overthink and I just need to not do that. But I‚Äôm a deep thinker and passionate feeler. 
This second time around I had a call with her and we laid some good ground work. She asked me to write what I will do differently this time around and what I can do I when people bug me (a prevention plan). I expressed to her that what has kept me sober the last five days is the realization that I could lose my family and friends for good if I drink again. I had an ernest talk with my sister prior to my chat with my sponsor and this realization weighs heavy on me. 
Well my sponsor, in an attempt to be helpful, told me that she could give me one more reason not to drink. She said if I drank, she would ‚Äúfire me.‚Äù She said it and kind of laughed but I know she was serious. I felt like shit after that and I think she said it because of my long relapse period up until now. I feel like she doesn‚Äôt realize how isolated I feel and how nervous I am I am going to end up with no one to turn to.
The reason why I‚Äôm here is because now I feel like she‚Äôs holding my sobriety over me. The thought of finding another sponsor is hard for me because I‚Äôm in such a delicate place right now. I‚Äôm afraid that what she told me was a bit tone deaf. I‚Äôm very aware that I can relapse at any second. But I kind of resent her for putting that type of pressure on me. It feels a little manipulative. Even if it‚Äôs meant to be for my own good. 
I don‚Äôt want a sponsor that will just watch me relapse and relapse again. But I want one that takes me seriously enough that won‚Äôt threaten to stop sponsoring me if I were to relapse.
I‚Äôm terrified of relapsing. But I also want to be true to myself and what I think are good relationships. I feel like maybe I offended her because my lapse was so long and I didn‚Äôt do any step work with her throughout it. She‚Äôs older and sickly and doesn‚Äôt make meetings anymore, just one on one calls with other alcoholics. So I know she cares about relationships. She is also kind of blunt and a little rough around the edges when it comes to communication. 
I feel like I‚Äôm too sensitive of a person to do the steps with her. For example when we did step one she just had me read a prayer (which I meant) but I really wanted to talk about why I felt powerless and what my belief in my higher power could look like. We also did step two and three (read another sentence long prayer). She then assigned me step four. When I expressed how overwhelming it seemed she talked about it like it was much simpler than it I felt it was. But honestly I wasn‚Äôt ready to go there alone and even now I am afraid to. I‚Äôm also not sure if I feel safe going there with someone who just told me if I fail and I drink, she won‚Äôt do this anymore. I guess it‚Äôs partly that she doesn‚Äôt trust me and doesn‚Äôt want me wasting her time. But I do my best not to. I only ever met with her when I felt ready to do the work. But I only met with her twice the year or so I was sober. I wasn‚Äôt ready then. And honestly I don‚Äôt feel ready now. I have depression and anxiety symptoms and a history of being abused. I thought maybe because she had also been abused we would relate more but now I realize everyone heals differently. When I had that talk with my sister recently I realized that she and my brother both kind of blocked their traumas and moved on. I have another sister that experienced the same abuse and she processed her trauma a little more like I am. By thinking about it and talking about it and confronting our abuser. My sponsor never really talked to her abuser, she kind of just moved on. I have a tendency to overshare because of my deep need for resolution. I used to have a counselor through the county behavioral health services but I no longer qualify for a counselor because resources are limited. I don‚Äôt want to re traumatize my sponsor by getting everything out but I feel like I have to really get it out in order to do this right. I don‚Äôt even know what to do because I‚Äôm so broken I don‚Äôt want to subject any one person to my mess. 
I really am putting myself out there and I hope you all are kind of you bothered to read my whole post. I realize I may just have so many character flaws I should just sit down and shut up but if you feel that is that is the case I hope you all can at least say so kindly.
I hope you all can maybe offer some clarity. I dont want to talk to my sponsor yet because I want to be sure I‚Äôm coming from an honest place as free from my pride and drinking demons as I can. Maybe I just need to see things differently. And I hope that I can. My convictions can be so strong and I usually try to honor them. It‚Äôs been almost thirty years of people telling me to turn my brain off and stop overthinking.",alcoholicsanonymous

**Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism**

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, 

My name is Saul Celere, and I'm an alcoholic. I'm happy to say that I haven't had a drink since the 1st of January this year, and I'm optimistic about my sober future.

I am also a philosopher and a theoretical physicist. My education was heavily scientific, and like a lot of people in the modern world, I view existence and our Universe logically and scientifically.

Over the last few decades something of a scientific consensus has been reached concluding that God does not exist; not all scientists are atheists, but most of them are, and if you ask a lot of modern people why they don't believe in God, they‚Äôre likely to tell you that science proves such ideas untrue.

Until five or six years ago I was a member of this consensus. I thought of myself as a 99% atheist; I wasn't willing to say with 100% certainty there was no God, indeed, to make such a claim would require a God-like knowledge and understanding of existence and our Universe, otherwise, you might be wrong. But I was pretty much convinced.

This conviction of atheism prevented me from using the concept of a ‚ÄúHigher Power‚Äù whenever I would try to stop drinking; as soon as I heard any talk of a Higher Power, I would immediately, if privately, dismiss it as nonsense.

But Socrates has been my hero since I was a kid, and he said ‚ÄúWisest is he who knows he knows nothing‚Äù. Well, thank God for Socrates and my 1% of doubt, because five or six years ago I had some scientific insights into the nature of Consciousness that cleaved open this doubt to reveal a new, expanded and very optimistic conceptual picture of our Universe and our connection to It.

Both God and the Human Soul, if they exist, are conscious entities, therefore, any new understanding of Consciousness can, at any time, alter or expand our understanding of God and how we relate to ... + Him+Her + ... ( God is much more than just male )

The scientific insights I had quickly led me to developing a very new and revolutionary, but rigorously scientific, conceptual picture of the Universe in which we live, and move, and have our being.

This has entailed me writing The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness. These principles have general applicability to all conscious systems, just like Newton‚Äôs Principles of Motion can be generally applied to all macroscopic dynamical systems. 

These Principles finally allow us to construct theoretical models of conscious entities and systems, such as the human nervous system. And, maybe more importantly, they can also be used to construct the first scientific, theoretical models of both The Mind of The Universe ( read Higher Power, God ), as well as the physical Human Soul.

These models are the means by which a resolutely scientific mind, such as my own, can find the concept of a Higher Power a plausible scientific reality. And, for me, finding a Higher Power genuinely, and logically, and scientifically plausible was absolutely essential to getting sober.

For the first time in my life I felt like I might be able to trust my Universe, that maybe my coming into existence wasn't actually a terrible, terrifying mistake, maybe I hadn't been born into a cold, dead, unfeeling, uncaring Universe, that I was totally separate from. 

Until then, I had conceived of my existence as a brief anomaly of personal Consciousness that would be followed, inexorably, by an eternity of total non-existence, and in retrospect I see how this conception of my existence undermined me as an inescapably moral and spiritual being.

But now God had become possible, and not just possible, but plausible, and even more plausible than no God. After three decades of atheism, this was the hell of a shock!!!  An ‚ÄúI need to lie down and breathe into a brown paper bag‚Äù kind of shock! And awe, lots of awe. Awe is quite like fear except it's a good thing, thrilling.

I'd been very unhappy for a very long time and I knew that my drinking was making my life worse and damaging my most meaningful relationships. But life was meaningless, pointless; whether I stopped drinking or not, whether I wound up with a family and friends, or completely alone, my own Universe was still going to eternally annihilate me.

The possibility of a Higher Power suggested the possibility of meaning and hope, meaning and hope that wasn't limited to just this one life I was making a mess of. So, I decided to conduct an experiment, an existential experiment, an experiment with my own existence, in which I was both the scientist and the rat.

I asked myself, ‚ÄúIf a Higher Power does exist, what would ‚Ä¶ + He + She + ‚Ä¶ advise me to do, and, very importantly, what not to do?‚Äù 

Top of the list was to stop drinking, and to really stop. And if I managed to stop for a few weeks, to stay stopped once I inevitably started whispering sweet nothings to myself about ‚ÄúWell, we can have one or two, just on the weekend, with my girl, that's ok‚Ä¶‚Äù

I can't say the experiment was a success because it's still going on. I had thought if I were to ever find God it would mean automatic, perennial happiness. In reality it has required me to work harder than I've ever worked in my life. But as I keep up the experiment I can't deny that I am happier than I was. 

The happiness is like when we used to roll a small snowball into an enormous ‚Äúsnowwheel‚Äù when we were kids; it gets bigger slowly, imperceptibly, and I have to keep pushing, but it's much more pleasant to be a happy Sisyphus halfway up the mountain, than a sad Sisyphus motionless at the bottom, paralyzed by his own nihilism.

Faith in a Higher Power made me realise my happiness is intimately related to my morality; that I will never be happy as long as I'm not making a concerted effort at self improvement, an effort that I don't abandon every time I get too stressed or have an argument with my girlfriend.

The more seriously I take my moral health the better my life becomes. ( Slowly, and it's hard, and it still regularly shocks me how hard it is; if I were to ever meet God, and assuming I didn't immediately go for His throat, I'd say ‚ÄúAll this, the Universe, existence, the stars, Earth, the plants and animals, Humanity etc., it's all amazing, but you've put the emotional, psychological, difficulty level up way too high! ) 

Anyway, all of this began with me finding God a plausible scientific reality, so, I wanted to help anyone who is finding it difficult to reconcile a modern scientific understanding of our Universe with faith in a Higher Power.

Here is a lecture/podcast called ‚ÄúIntroduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction‚Äù in which I explain what Principia Theologica is:

[Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction](https://youtu.be/8NQJQN0D9A4)

In the description is a link to episode 1 of around 12 episodes of Principia Theologica, in which I outline a rigorously scientific approach to the Higher Power. If the picture of our existence painted by the modern interpretation of science depresses or scares you, there is great hope and relief to be found in these philosophical ideas and the truth about our physico-conscious being.

Best of luck on your journey!!!

Sincelerely,

Saul C√©lere.",alcoholicsanonymous
"There‚Äôs a lot of shit going on in many meetings in my area that are off-putting to me. Everyone has a ‚Äúeveryone for themselves‚Äù and ‚Äúmy problem is worse that yours‚Äù attitude. It also feels like a pissing contest of who shares the best. My sponsor is not answering my calls or replying to my texts while being passive aggressive on Facebook. My dad tried to kill himself and I don‚Äôt know how to respond to it and the meetings/my sponsor aren‚Äôt helping me. I feel really alone even in the rooms of AA, probably even more so in the rooms of AA. I‚Äôll get 4 years sober this year and I‚Äôve worked my steps. I don‚Äôt wanna relapse but I feel like I‚Äôve gotten as much as I can get out of the meetings.

"I have a problem

I can admit that now.

I quit drinking 7 years ago. Stone cold sober since, until 11 months ago. ‚ÄúI can have one‚Äù I told myself ‚Äújust a sip‚Äù

You know the rest of the story. I did well for months. A glass here or there. Then it got worse. It changed from ‚ÄúI drink and have fun‚Äù to ‚ÄúI need to drink to have fun ‚Äú. 

Finally, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I drink just to avoid the shakes. It‚Äôs not fun, I no longer delight in the taste, the effects. I just  want my hands to be steady for a while. To not sweat bullets in a 72 degree room. 

Im blessed. iv talked to my wife and shes an amazing source of support. But no one else knows. iv got a facade of normality I don't believe anyone sees through. I'm just looking to connect with other alcoholics.

I go to one meeting a week, my home group. My sponsor and I talk but I feel like our relationship has lost something. I feel like I give him guidance and much as he gives me guidance. 

I reverted back to being a short-tempered asshole at home. The thoughts of wanting to drink are back and I‚Äôve white-knuckled it more than a few times. My whole family drinks so alcohol is always at family gatherings (not at my house). I think people are beginning to see me crack and because they are asking when I‚Äôm going to start drinking again.

"Some of the main reserves of a newly sober person is to avoid AA at all costs because that don't want to become an overly religious nut. AA is not a Religious program. It's a spiritual one. The main problem we drinkers and druggies face is the overwhelming self absorption of our own problems and the need to control everything outside of ourselves in order to fix them. When all this fails, we begin to feel down on ourselves and turn to the bottle as an escape. What AA does is help you look inside yourself to fix the route of all these problems. You'll find that when you fix your inner world, your outer world will start to come together too. This is done in a 12 step map that is easy to follow and has confirmed results. What people don't realize is that normal, healthy, everyday people already unconsciously live by these steps. Think of it like wearing a pair of glasses. Let's say that everyone in the world has a pair that they see the world through. However, every time something tragic or traumatic happens to you, your glasses smudge. What the AA program does is clean your smudged glasses so you can began to see the world, others, and yourself clearly again. If you have any reservations about embarking on this journey because you fear religion and cults, then have no fear. If your into that then try looking somewhere else. Stick to the book, it's worked for many and will work for you too if you work it.",alcoholicsanonymous
"All my friends have left me, I'm virtually alone in this world except for my mother and my sponsor.  I'm ugly, and stupid.  I'm on disability for BPD and bipolar, so I don't work.  But I'm keenly aware that I'm only allowed to be around other human beings if I'm working for them.  Even my sponsor only comes around when she needs something usually.  

Anyway, I've been thinking this morning.  Why not just implode and start drinking again?  It's not like I have much to lose as it's clear my life isn't worth much to begin with, you know?  I was drunk for ten years straight at one point from my teens on, and I kind of feel like I want to go back to that.  At least then when I was blasted persistently I didn't care about how no one cared about me, I was too busy being drunk.

I dunno, my life is so pathetic it's almost like the options are get drunk or die.  And I don't even want to drink!  It's like I'm being forced to somehow!  It's fucked up.  Some people are just born losers, and it's not fair to be one of those people.",alcoholicsanonymous
Had been doing good up until June no alcohol at all.  when I went to visit with friends I agreed with partner that I would have one pub session. 2 months later and I've been struggling to stay sober. In fact all last week was a binge week. Feeling very sick and worried over the madness i could have gotten up to (I barely distinguish the days of last week in my mind). Partner is super pissed at me and it could be the last nail in the coffin. This is Day 1. It's time to stop forever.,alcoholicsanonymous

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 83

When I survey my drinking days, I recall many people whom my life touched casually, but whose days I troubled through my anger and sarcasm.  These people are untraceable, and direct amends to them are not possible.  The only amends I can make to those untraceable individuals, the only 'changes for the better' I can offer, are indirect amends made to other people, whose paths briefly cross mine.  Courtesy and kindness, regularly practiced, help me to live in emotional balance, at peace with myself.

Now I‚Äôm up to drinking half a bottle (750ml) of whiskey or more a day. When I try to stop, my anxiety goes through the roof. Absolutely unbearable until I start having panic attacks and run for the alcohol to make it stop.

"I made the decision to stop drinking in the middle of June and haven't looked back.  Despite struggling every day I have managed to quit for good this time.  For me, the toughest part has not been staying away from drinking but managing the symptoms that I have faced resulting from my drinking.  I suffered nearly 3-4 extremely difficult anxiety attacks for at least the first six weeks that I stopped drinking and still suffer from very difficult anxiety symptoms that are debilitating everyday.  What I believe to be the source of the anxiety is my stomach problems.  The brain and the gut are interconnected and anxiety and depression symptoms are associated with GI problems.  For the past nearly 90 days my abdomen is bloated, I have burning pain, I have difficulty swallowing, I belch every few minutes and my stools have been very small and inadequate.  I do not have gastritis or any structural problems so I do not know what the issue is.  My best guess is that my digestive system is all messed up and I am holding on to the small hope that it will hopefully go away in the next 1,2,3 months ahead or so.  My question for everyone is has anyone experienced abdominal issues and symptoms recovering from alcoholism that sound similar to mine?  Has anyone had those issues and/or anxiety symptoms?  If so what helped them go away for you?  And how long did it take for the symptoms to subside?  Thank you!  and everyone struggling know that it is STILL 100% worth the uphill battle!

At every meeting, they suggest if you don't have a sponsor, that you get one. How does one go about finding a permanent (or at least, more than temporary) sponsor? I could really do with someone to talk things through with, to help me work the program and stuff.

I feel I don‚Äôt know how to make a comeback from this one. 

I made awful, awful decisions, I burnt many, many bridges earlier this week on an alcoholic binge, openly exclaimed very private feelings to people I shouldn‚Äôt have (before blacking out). I made a complete fool of myself. This progression into a downward spiral, has disrupted everything.

Im retrospect, in the back of my head I knew I‚Äôd relapse weeks beforehand. I had a gut feeling to stay home that day instead of running errands, which I actively participated in ignoring. This disease, is progressive. I picked up exactly where I left off.

Even on attempted sober streaks, past memories resurface that I do the best to deal with. Now that I‚Äôve created a whole new host of social, and personal issues, it‚Äôs back to square one and it‚Äôs overwhelming to think of facing a new day.

Mind you, I have not done that same research and I‚Äôm not trying to create a thread debating the efficacy of AA - it has quite literally changed my life in 3 weeks.

"RECONSTRUCTION

Yes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead...

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 83

The reconstruction of my life is the prime goal in my recovery as I avoid taking that first drink, one day at a time.  The task is most successfully accomplished by working the Steps of our Fellowship.  The spiritual life is not a theory; it works, but I have to live it.  Step Two started me on my journey to develop a spiritual life; Step Nine allows me to move into the final phase of the initial Steps which taught me how to live a spiritual life.  Without the guidance and strength of a Higher Power, it would be impossible to proceed through the various stages of reconstruction.  I realize that God works for me and through me.  Proof comes to me when I realize that God did for me what I could not do for myself, by removing that gnawing compulsion to drink.  I must continue daily to seek God's guidance.  He grants me a daily reprieve and will provide the power I need for reconstruction.

"5 and a half months ago I went to a treatment center  and moved out of my parents home into a sober living home. The first 3 months were good, I found work doing hard labor, I got in shape and was sober and felt okay with things. Then I relapsed at a wedding a month and a half ago, have to redo my 4th step and I just CAN NOT motivate myself to do it more than 30 minutes or an hour at a time. I have so many resentments and its such a painstaking process to be thorough and honest as the book says. When I did my 1st 4th step in treatment (with a temporary sponsor) my motivation for my sobriety was much higher and that 4th step is probably the most thorough one I'll ever do.

 Now it just feels like Im jotting down a bunch of stuff down just to show my sober home that Im working the program and I dont have the mental and spiritual focus to get through it. Idk what to do. If I drink and fail a drug test, Im on the streets. Should I just say fuck it, and go drink some more til Im desperate again? Its just extremely difficult to white knuckle it through another 4th step.

"Unfortunately my last stupid decision probably cost my new job and my dream career. One decision to drink just a little more ended up getting me in some major trouble and traumatizing me. I now have to deal with court in about two months and although it's very minor misdemeanor that will hopefully be dismissed with my attorney, the collateral damage and the lasting impact is something I would not wish upon a single soul on this earth. 

I have to stop drinking. This is it. End of the Line. 

No more chances. It's too late to say 'I was so lucky wow I need to stop.' because this time I was not lucky. And the consequences are severe. And I am depressed. And I just wanted to reach out to this community and do the responsible correct thing for once and fix myself.",alcoholicsanonymous
"So I hate my sober self. Sober me is a socially awkward, unconfident excuse of a man who thinks way too much and complains about how his abusive mother and childhood trauma shaped his life for the worse. He is also irrational and I hate that guy. He is a guy who puts up a semi strong wall, and behind that hides a mountain of insecurities that ultimately Ruins his life.

Drunk me on the other hand turns into a social butterfly who becomes the life of the party. Someone who is not afraid to socialise or interact with people. Drunk/tipsy me also seems to know what to do and knows the right decision even if they don't act on it. Drunk me is happier and seems to have no worries or problems, where as Drunk me would over think.

Sober and drunk me can agree on that, Drunk me is the better and more confident version of me. I wish I had that drunk mentality while sober. 


Does anyone have any advice on how I can achieve this? As ""sober me"" really need to go away for good, but I am worried about becoming an alcohol.

"hi. i think i have a drinking problem.

it started  years ago. at thirteen, i had my first drink. it was at a bar in tenerife and it was a couple beers. i was petite and young so the alcohol kicked in fast. it fucked me up. i dont remember anything but the feeling of being messed up felt so good. after that, i stopped drinking for 2 years because i was scared of alcohol. i didnt want to get fucked up again. but at 15 i was at a party and i had a sip of vodka and...needless to say, i went overboard and blacked out. i needed it to have fun. 

thats when it began. it started with just drinking with friends, then with the family, then on my own in my room. actually, i'm drinking right now in my room while i write this. i drink about 3-5 shots of vodka 3-4 times a week. i even find myself thinking about drinking if i'm sad. i do it at night alone in my room...it helps me sleep. if i dont drink at night i have suicidal thoughts and cant sleep.

you might be wondering---how can you afford all that booze?

well, my dad owns a bar in our backyard. i sneak out to it when my parents are out or asleep and take a bottle of vodka. my dad bulk buys booze so he doesnt notice. i have a stash in my room. one bottle lasts me about a four days and when i run out i just...make a trip to the bar. 

its either big or go home when i drink. i dont have a limit. i'll drink until i am literally blacking out choking on my own sick. 

i have mental health issues that have been discussed in therapy (went a few years ago because of a family issue) but no diagnosis came out of that. but pretty sure i have depression and anxiety--i dont need a expensive hour for a dickhead to tell me what is obvious.

anyway, i wanna talk to someone about this. i dont see many teenager alcholics.

"BUILDING A NEW LIFE

We feel a man is unthinking when he says sobriety is enough

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 82

When I reflect on Step Nine, I see that physical sobriety must be enough for me.  I need to remember the hopelessness I felt before I found sobriety, and how I was willing to go to any lengths for it.  Physical sobriety is not enough for those around me, however, since I must see that God's gift is used to build a new life for my family and loved ones.  Just as importantly, I must be available to help others who want the A.A. way of life.  I ask God to help me share the gift of sobriety so that its benefits may be shown to those I know and love.

"Howdy.  

Gonna try to be brief.  I'm a dude in my late 20s.  I have been sober for a week and attended three meetings in total.  I have done a few AA/SMART meetings in the past, but was never really serious about it.  Have known I have a problem for several years but decided to kick the can down the road.  

Recently had a bad night and kinda said 'enough is enough' and realized I need to get this shit under control before I'm in my 50s wishing I had gotten it under control sooner.  

I am not looking to replace my alcoholism with AA.  I realize people gotta do what they gotta do to stay sober.   

--- 

**Day 1:** Go to a meeting.  Meet some people, chit-chat, yadda-yadda.  Dude 10 years my junior pulls me aside and starts preaching AA to me.  Okay, cool.  He's obviously stoked on the program, good for him.  I'm still feeling out the program and whether it fits.  We exchange numbers.  He tells me to come to a meeting tomorrow as well.  Really don't want to, but fuck it, stuff I've been doing hasn't been helping, so why not.  

**Day 2:**  Get a text at noon from this guy.  

&gt;""Call me when you get a chance.""  

I'm at work, and more importantly, **I do not know you.**  Get another call around 3.  Multiple text messages.  

&gt;""Where do you live? Do you need a ride?""

At the end the guy pulls me aside and starts preaching AA again and how important sponsorship is, etc.  I set some boundaries with ""I'm not looking for that, I appreciate the extended offer, not looking to attend meetings every day"" (why the fuck am I explaining myself to this guy)?  But he continues on.  

**Day 3:** More texts and phone calls.  Blocked.  End of story.  

**Day 7:** See him at the meeting, exchange pleasantries.  No big deal.  End up sitting next to *another* guy that's about the same age as guy 1 who immediately gives me his phone and tells me to put my number in it.  Like a fucking idiot I do it.  

Meeting is alright, but I notice everyone who shares harps on the importance of a sponsor and how necessary it is to have one. 

At the end of the meeting the new guy approaches me with the same talking points as the first guy.  

Curious to see what tomorrow holds.  

--- 

&gt;Remember when I said I'll try to be brief?  

First things first, I'm not judging the program off of one overzealous, well-intentioned person.  That would be asinine.  I do not intend to drop meetings because of these interactions.  I decided to go to meetings of my own volition and I'll stop going to them the same way.   

However... I am *not* looking for a fellowship.  I am *not* looking for friends.  Doesn't mean I'm going to be an antisocial asshole at meetings either.  We're all there for the same reason and there's value in sharing experiences.  

From these meetings though, I'm noticing a pattern in how ""into"" AA everyone is.  Like people are stoked to the nth degree on the program.  They say the name ""Bill"" with revere.  

Is my addict brain looking for reasons to say ""fuck AA you don't need that""?  Of course it is.  I am fully aware of that, which is why I'm putting forth an effort to attend in spite of those feelings.  But hot-damn, it feels like there must be a sponsorship punch-card program where you get a free hat or something after you get 10 sponsees or something with the way everyone talks about it.  

---  

**In closing**:  Is this *normal* behavior?  It's hella off-putting and I feel like I'm being sold something which immediately raises red-flags for me.  Could just be the group dynamic, I don't know.  I'm really looking to use AA as a tool to achieve sobriety, not make it part of my identity.  


Sorry for the wall, just felt like sharing, 

Cheers.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I‚Äôm in college and still live at home. My dad is an alcoholic, but it‚Äôs sort of varied. Like me, he goes through phases of heavily drinking and phases where he lets it go. During his heavy drinking, however, he will be absolutely blasted by 7 pm. Mostly off of a ton of beer, but sometimes shots when things are worse. 

I was sober for a few weeks and had been ignoring his whole coming home drunk issue. He told me he was either getting drunk at the bar or drinking in his car so he wouldn‚Äôt trigger me. I begged him to just drink at home, for obvious reasons, but eventually it got to me. He didn‚Äôt drink at home during that time, but just came home obviously drunk. It would trigger me because I started drinking to get that fucked up, I wanted to feel nothing. 

Is it too much to ask him to stop? Or drink after I go to bed? I truly do not think my father is capable of quitting. I have debated going to my room at a specific time each night (maybe 7ish) and asking him to drink once I‚Äôm in my room. 

I feel sensitive. I feel easily upset with alcohol. I can remove myself from most situations. I can‚Äôt remove myself from my home. I think I‚Äôm attending my first AA meeting tomorrow and just need help at home.  

I have begged my dad for years to stop. I understand that it has to be something he wants to do. I have begged him to not drink and drive, which never goes well. How do I stay strong with another addict around?",alcoholicsanonymous
"My dad's alcoholism is why his anger became abusive. My mom's addiction is what killed her at the age of 46. I'm 99% sure I could find some friends, go have a beer, and it'd be a good enough time. Being the adult child of an alcoholic, I learned to be cautious with drugs and drinking. I have been cautious. Adult children are talented.

I'm 0% that I'll be able to drink cautiously forever. Whatever was in my dad that made him abuse me... whatever was in my mom that made her run from her pain...

That's in me too. And it's completely out of my control. I'm not going to live my life only for that shit to pop out from around a corner and ruin everything. I'd rather keep taking it to therapy and AA. See what it actually is.

"I grew up around alcoholism and drug issues. My dad has a never-ending issue with alcohol, and I believe that is what triggered my relapse. I see him drinking, happy, and I want to also being drunk and happy. 

I was in therapy last week and we discussed that I am past the point of having a healthy relationship with any sort of alcohol or drug (mine is weed). I realized that my sober life... is my new life. I always assumed I could slowly re-introduce alcohol or weed to my life, which after this relapse, has become a joke. I am out of control with every substance. It makes me feel suicidal to go through life sober. It makes me anxious. I'd almost rather live on welfare and only consume weed and alcohol than do anything else. I almost feel this is how I will die. 

How do you handle sobriety? How do I cope with the fact that the only thing to bring me this much joy (being blasted out of this world) is not sustainable?

I ran out of weed yesterday, and I've been drinking today. I am supposed to start an antibiotic, but hav pushed it back couple days so I could drink (doctor told me I will get sick if I take it with medicine). Do I join an AA meeting? Do I just talk to my therapist? Am I overreacting (as my family has told me)? What do I do? I am freaking out, I thought I would avoid this. I feel I am young, but I feel terrified. My ""addictions"" make me want to end everything.",alcoholicsanonymous

"I'm finally at a breaking point with drinking. I've been drinking whiskey every day for 2ish years. I want to stop but the only thing I'm afraid of is how bad the withdrawal will be. I have terrible, terrible panic disorder and I'm trying to reach out anywhere that will build up some motivation to finally make the move. 

I have panic attacks and severe anxiety most of the time, and I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow to talk about that alongside my drinking problem. But my panic disorder is making it incredibly difficult to commit to the idea.

I'm horrified of severe symptoms. I hear about DTs, seizures, and hallucinations. I want to know how safe I am. I need some reassurance. I need something to cling to if I'm going to go through this. 

I don't expect withdrawal to be easy. That's why I'm reaching out to my doctor for librium or any other drug that will help the symptoms. I am genuinely terrified about dying because of the process.

I have a 3 year old daughter and the idea of me not being there for her scares the crap out of me.

Can anyone give me some positive insight? Will I make it? Is it worth it? Should I keep drinking for the sake of my safety?

"Hi my name is D and I'm an alcoholic, and it was only thanks to God and my home group that I today took a 30 day chip. Hopefully, with the help of God, this will be my last one.

"FINDING 'A REASON TO BELIEVE'

The willingness to grow is the essence of all spiritual development.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 171

A line from a song goes, '... and I look to find a reason to believe...' It reminds me that at one time I was not able to find a reason to believe that my life was all right.  Even though my life had been saved by my coming to A.A., three months later I went out and drank again.  Someone told me: 'You don't have to believe.  Aren't you willing to believe that there is a reason for your life, even though you may not know yourself what that reason is, or that you may not sometimes know the right way to behave?'  When I saw how willing I was to believe there was a reason for my life, then I could start to work on the Steps.  Now when I begin with, 'I am willing...', I am using the key that leads to action, honesty, and an openness to a Higher Power moving through my life.

"Ive found a sense of therapy in this subreddit, and it makes me worried that the high of that will fade. I‚Äôve overcome a couple of hurdles so far this week but I‚Äôm not completely elated about it. Part of me feels the way I felt when I lost my smell/taste when I first got Covid, like a ghost. Just hovering along. 

My college offers free counseling to students. I‚Äôve been meaning to reach out for over a year now but it‚Äôs so much easier penning a novel here than it is verbalize your feelings to a person in front of you. I‚Äôm worried about wasting my time with empty suggestions. I want that instant gratification, give me the answers, and fix me today counseling-which doesn‚Äôt exist. 

I have to say that when I woke up today, I had a clarity, energy level, and solid will to not drink today. The dealer I usually get c*ke from texts near daily messages to everyone he sells to say he‚Äôll only be available certain times of the day. I texted him back thanking him for everything but that I‚Äôm making the personal decision to not buy anymore. It was the right thing to do, but doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt procure it through someone else when the desire rears its ugly head again. 

I‚Äôm almost 31. When I turned 30 I told myself, ‚Äúokay, this is where you grow the fuck up‚Äù, yet I kept doing the same old things because they were cozy. The most recent cozy things being getting off of work, going to a bar and having a few, then going home and having more, and using some of the bag, if I had one, to keep a chilled elevation. I‚Äôd clean the house and dance around, slump on the couch and surf the internet on the phone while tv is running and repeat. How the hell was that in any way amusing, lol? Now, with new introspective eyes, I have two more months until my birthday to really impress myself. It‚Äôs really not about a deadline but it would mean something to me to do this. If I want to succeed and get into this program at school, be part of the medical field, and assist in saving lives I really need and be that person now. 

For most of the day I‚Äôve been daydreaming about that refreshing first sip of a beer and then the wave of relaxation from said beer. Monday, my friend (who I pretty much solely drink and do blow with) and I plan to go hiking. We are both dying for nature and fresh air and something that doesn‚Äôt require alcohol, but honestly (I know this is mean) it‚Äôs the only way I can tolerate her most times. We can have good conversation that way, otherwise she babbles and it makes me want to run into a wall. There‚Äôs a lodge restaurant up where we want to hike, and it‚Äôs got a bar. I‚Äôve relayed, in my mind, celebrating with a drink to commemorate going a week without drinking like 100 times now. It seems like the ultimate day-nature and hops. I hope I‚Äôm strong enough to not want to give in after the hike. Or at the very least maybe I have one and I‚Äôm done and I don‚Äôt repeat patterns of yesterday. 

Day 4 has pretty much been the longest stretch of time I‚Äôve gone without drinking and these noticeable changes will stick with me, even if I do decide to drink in the near future. I‚Äôve screwed my head on a bit tighter these last few days and I will tally that as a win.",alcoholicsanonymous

Disclaimer: I am in AlAnon and I have encouraged him to attend AA, but he‚Äôs really put off by the steps and the Higher Power part. It‚Äôs an ongoing conversation. 

That said, I‚Äôd like to get him a gift or treat to commemorate this milestone since he won‚Äôt be collecting chips or checking in with anyone. But I also worry that doing so would put unnecessary pressure on him. 

I thought I‚Äôd ask this group if you would appreciate little tokens to mark and reinforce your sobriety or if you feel like something like that coming from a close loved one would put too much pressure on you.

If more gifts are to be received, our awakening has to go on.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 8

Sobriety fills the painful 'hole in the soul' that my alcoholism created.  Often I feel so physically well that I believe my work is done.  However, joy is not just the absence of pain; it is the gift of continued spiritual awakening.  Joy comes from ongoing and active study, as well as application of the principles of recovery in my everyday life, and from sharing that experience with others.  My Higher Power presents many opportunities for deeper spiritual awakening.  I need only to bring into my recovery the willingness to grow.  Today I am ready to grow.

I generally take phenomenal care of myself as well, for the last 23 days my apartment has been xleaned with a ‚Äúill stop‚Äù mindset, yet to lose another battle and my place is covered in beer bottles and liquor bottles and whatever nasty food I put in my body.

I‚Äôm not a functional alcoholic, that was long ago, I work from home so was able to manage for some time.

My bills are paid through sept and the bigger ones through October, but now I will wrestle with the anxiety about what to do and deal with the internal ass whoopings of WTF DID YOU DO. For 14-21 days.

I‚Äôm just, so ashamed. I never want to drink again but I feel like I‚Äôm so lazy with doing what needs done I‚Äôll get good for a few years this time then make another dumb ass decision.

Thanks",alcoholicsanonymous
"ive (young adult F) been drinking daily all week but mostly in the afternoon or night. last night i was watching the big lebowski lol and apparently i fell asleep from one second to the next. i woke up feeling totally fine and nothing felt off but then i noticed i wasn‚Äôt wearing bottoms just a shirt and i couldn‚Äôt remember how i got to bed and then the worst part came. 

my sleep shorts were soaked on the ground and my desk chair had a puddle of urine in it. it must have happened in the middle of the night but gosh i‚Äôm embarrassed. it‚Äôs a white chair so maybe i thought it looked like a toilet omg. also i have no clue where my underwear lmao. this is a new low i can‚Äôt help but feel stupid.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hey all! I made it to 14 days again! Yay!! Anywho, I‚Äôm starting over on my steps and have been talking/thinking about the meaning of being an alcoholic: physical allergy, spiritual malady, and obsession of the mind.

"I took my last drink 4 years ago, August 2017. 

In 2016 I tried to control my drinking. In 2017 I tried to quit.  I realized I needed help. 

I started attending to meetings in August 2017. Eventually I found a sponsor who was willing to guide me through the book Alcoholics Anonymous. 

We followed the directions for the 12 steps from that book. 

By the time we got to step 12, i realized my obsession to drink was gone.

I haven‚Äôt had any temptation, urge or craving since I began practicing the 12 steps.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I must say.
I went through quite a few AA meetings. I got divorced, i quit, I relapsed, I quit. 

Now. This is the point the post changes. I quit because I wanted to. The power rests in you and only you. You are strong, the version of you that uses, is weak, but you. The real you is strong. You do not need anything or anyone to tell you the time to quit. You fuck up, you feel bad, you fuck up, you feel bad. Only you can change this. You are fucking up, you are making yourself feel bad. You are making your family upset because of your actions. You can either be a coward and shy away from this truth. Or you can decide to live life the way you want to. Without fear. You don‚Äôt have to rely on anything but yourself. You can take responsibility and fix this fuckin bullshit.

In the end. It does not matter what was done in the past. There is time. You cannot change the past, but you have a personal responsibility for the future. You don‚Äôt like how you are now? Change it. It won‚Äôt be soon, and it won‚Äôt be easy. But you are the only one who can change the future.
Not some greater power, not your wife/husband. Not some higher power. YOU! And only YOU!


Hopefully, this post will not be deleted. Because AA did not help me. I helped me. Indulgence not compulsion. If Indulgence is too much, then fuck it. Nothing for me/you.
You do not have to rely on anyone but yourself, to make you a better person. Unless that is what you want to do.",alcoholicsanonymous
"It feels good. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it. Was a very welcoming group of folks and it was nice to feel understood on some level before I even said a word. Was anxious as hell, had a hard time making eye contact and choked up a few times while sharing once my turn came 'round. 

One of the guys gave me a list of numbers after the meeting and told me to reach out whenever. Got my 24 hour token (six days sober) and several people encouraged me to come back to the next meeting on Thursday. Was a pretty wholesome and positive experience.

"I‚Äôm 19 a few months away from 20, went to rehab when I was 16 and got out right before my 18th birthday. Since last summer, so about 15 months ago alcohol became a pretty big part of my life. I don‚Äôt do other drugs a lot but I‚Äôve been drinking everyday for quite sometime, as in I think all of august and most days in the months prior. I‚Äôve blacked out more times than I can remember and done some really stupid shit. College just started and it‚Äôs my first year being on campus because of covid and me and my friend have been drinking heavy the whole time. We‚Äôve gotten drunk during the day, even when we have classes later, and every night has involved a lot of drinking and partying.  
  Yesterday we talked to each other about it and we‚Äôre stopping today. It‚Äôs harder than I thought and I keep find myself making excuses to drink but I haven‚Äôt at all today and I‚Äôm proud of that. I‚Äôve been to AA before back when I was in rehab and I‚Äôm just remembering all of that until I have time to go to AA later this week. I just wanted to say that because it‚Äôs a big thing. I‚Äôve wanted to stop for months but this is the first time I‚Äôve stopped intentionally and I‚Äôm glad to have my homie here with me for encouragement.",alcoholicsanonymous

"It‚Äôs been 23 days and it‚Äôs hard, but made harder because my Husband wants his drinking buddy back.  I was always a closet drinker and worked hard to hide the amount that I drank, whereas he drinks everyday but is totally upfront about it, and honestly it doesn‚Äôt change his personality or interfere with work and he doesn‚Äôt binge like I do‚Ä¶did. I got tired of waking up and not knowing if I was going to be fighting a hangover or not. It‚Äôs actually great waking up without one.

We spent last weekend camping with friends and I did fine around the drinking,  partially because Hubby had others to drink with so he wasn‚Äôt trying to get me to have a drink with him.  I haven‚Äôt told anyone except my Husband that I am an alcoholic (he doesn‚Äôt believe I am) and no one seemed to notice or care that I drank seltzer all weekend. Is it important to tell people?


So, more questions: Is it possible to quit before you hit rock bottom?  Maybe dodge the DWI ticket or irreparable family issues?  And is it possible for me to stay sober and stay married to my Husband who I love very much, but know that he probably won‚Äôt ever stop drinking?

Thanks, I‚Äôm trying to figure this out.",alcoholicsanonymous

Saying weed as a medicine is ""ok"" what is everyone's thoughts. Like I said I am not trying to say this is what I am trying to do or what I condone.

"I found the most anarchist place to hang as a punker, AA.  I was a rebel because I  did drugs but I was a follower because I did the steps.

20 years sober,  I don't have the answers for you.  My answers are helping you.  That's my magic ingredient.   I got into service early.

Hospitals and Institution Panels opened my eyes to the real work.  The dirty work before people even find themselves at a meeting.  Being sober was amazing at 60 days the Institution doors didn't lock me in.  They freed me.

Life happened.  My family is all passed away.  Sobriety doesn't stop time, sickness or grief.  I does richen my experience.  At least I can be there for the next person to lose a parent.

I have other addictions.  Alcoholism and mental illness and ptsd and grief.  Life can be like spinning plates.  But it's easier when sober HA.

Therapy helps, education helps, writing helps, helping others works.  The magic, the x factor,  the unobtanium is helping other alcoholics.

"Working on day 50 today. For the last 11 years I have suffered from depression. After all the pills and different shit I've done to get out of episodes, nothing works as well as going to a meeting. Total mood changer and it can turn the shittiest of days into the best day. I am enjoying connecting with people and being able to put my kids to bed, sober, every night is a blessing. Heres to another 24! üéâ",alcoholicsanonymous
"I can't believe I have made it four days! I started abusing alcohol when I was 24. I was depressed and struggling with my sister's untimely death due to suicide. It got to the point where my average was 6-7 drinks a day, but I would also constantly drink in excess to that if I wasn't working or felt like calling in for a few days. Days like that, I'd have 12-15 drinks. I weigh 130lb, so yeah. 

My eye opening moment was getting into another HUGE alcohol fueled fight with my fiance (who hardly drinks at all). I am surprised he stuck around through me getting drunk and arguing with him over stuff that never happened or that doesn't make sense. I got beligerantly drunk and argued with him for no reason, for five hours. He just sat there and let me yell at him because I was so drunk he was afraid for my safety... how embarrassing. 

I am a good person down to my core, but after a certain point of drinking it's like that part of me shuts off and I turn into an asshole. I've tried to limit my drinking so I don't turn into an angry drunk, but I can't just limit my drinks. I will keep on drinking until there is nothing left to drink. 

This is the only way for me. Cold turkey. I would say my withdrawals peaked yesterday and I'm finally on the mend. I still feel like total garbage and want to drink so I can end the four days of physical torment I've been dealing with, but I'm done for good this time.

"I farted around for 6 years, maybe that's what I needed. I know people who farted around for 20 years and went to 25 rehabs. Some people just went and absorbed it right away. I really didn't get a sponsor or follow through with my first sponsor because I wasn't ready, and that's OK, and I'm really glad I've been following through with a sponsor now. There's a guy at meetings, a few guys, talk about how important it is to get a sponsor. I've always found that kind of annoying, but I guess I see where they are coming from. It's as deep as the psychotherapy and the meditation I did before I became an alcoholic. I really hope I can give back at some point. There's a guy who needs a sponsor and I think I'm his sponsor, but maybe in the future, time will tell. The urge to carry it forward is important to recovery, meeting people where they are.",alcoholicsanonymous

"A UNIQUE PROGRAM

Alcoholics Anonymous will never have a professional class.  We have gained some understanding of the ancient words 'Freely ye have received, freely give.'  We have discovered that at the point of professionalism, money and spirituality do not mix.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 166

I believe that Alcoholics Anonymous stands alone in the treatment of alcoholism because it is based solely on the principle of one alcoholic sharing with another alcoholic.  This is what makes the program unique.  When I decided that I wanted to stay sober, I called a woman who I knew was a sober member of A.A., and she carried the message of Alcoholics Anonymous to me.  She received no monetary compensation, but rather was paid by staying sober another day herself.  Today I could ask for no payment other than another day free from alcohol, so in that respect, I am generously paid for my labor.

"So I was never much for drinking in high school or even college, just a little social drinks here and there. After I started making good money I got into wine and whiskey, started binging them hard every night,
blackouts, that sort of thing. After a few months I got ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù about my drinking, and my tolerance rose as I learned to keep my intoxication at a certain level. Rarely hungover, rarely had those ugly gaps of ‚Äúhow much did I drink last night‚Äù.

Of course after that it started to become the default state not just for evenings but weekends in general, then a drink in the morning to loosen up before work, then drinking through the work day, almost never getting drunk enough to have it pass an enjoyable ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù. 

A drink to unwind, to calm the nerves, to pass the time bored, to make a fun time more fun, till now four years in I realised I can‚Äôt function without it.

I don‚Äôt even think I want to be forever 100% alcohol free but I need to break alcohol being a part of my regular life and not just a treat at social encounters for at least a few months but it‚Äôs like this naked feeling without it already. 

My mind is already trying to make excuses, ‚Äújust one every other day‚Äù and shit like that like I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve been increasingly living in a haze for the past few years.

I kept joking with friends that I was a functioning alcoholic because by all accounts my life was well functioning; good job, relationships all well maintained, but I feel like I was just gradually losing the plot, feeling less motivated, more unhealthy, and that if I didn‚Äôt stop I would one day not wake up from this.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Today actually marks a week since I‚Äôve deactivated my instagram with intention to take a week break, without caving to  reactivate in between. IG has long been my social media vice, and I‚Äôve drawn a lot of inspiration and gratification from it but it has been toxic as well. It‚Äôs where I put my FBI creeper skills to ‚Äúuse‚Äù and endlessly scan things I know are detrimental to my mental health. I‚Äôm pleased with this development, and I don‚Äôt really have the desire to reactive just yet. This is the same mindset I want with drinking. If you read my other posts, you‚Äôll see that I plan on at least week break from the bev. 
It‚Äôs day 2 and I‚Äôm struggling. 

The last time I took a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from drinking was when I was quarantined from my boyfriend in the same house due to Covid in early May. I was diluting my body with water rather than beer and after 3/4 days of painful boredom, I said screw it-I‚Äôm drinking. Not because I felt the urge but because I wanted to feel something and occupy time.
Fast forward to present day and I have chest tightness just from trying to not think about drinking. It doesn‚Äôt seem fair to actively try to do better but still be possessed by this feeling. I‚Äôm constantly reading all of your Day 10s, Day 35s, Day 1000s, and I know it‚Äôs possible, I just need to get past the irritable parts. 

On a good note, yesterday I went to the plant shop to buy my boyfriend a gift for moving up in his job. I ended up getting one for myself as well. I think plants add beauty and a sense of duty to a home. I actually kind of wanted the plant I got him for myself as a secret way to track my progress in this journey. ‚ÄòPothos‚Äô are those unmistakable vine-y green leafed plants you‚Äôve probably seen in at least one house growing up. They grow very quickly and before you know it you have an elegant, cascading decoration that you grew and took care of. I wanted to suggest that to anyone that‚Äôs trying out sobriety and an unconventional way of tracking it? If you‚Äôre curious about what I got myself, it makes more sense for my present situation; Google ‚Äòfishbone cactus‚Äô haha.",alcoholicsanonymous

It‚Äôs usually when I‚Äôm stressed but it freaks me out that I don‚Äôt have a off switch. It probably happens once every few months.

"I've been doing really well recently, going to meetings, one-on-one therapy and handling my issue with binge drinking. I've been on a weekend away with a friend and enjoyed non-alcoholic drinks. I went out for my birthday and enjoyed virgin cocktails. I was starting to feel very empowered like I wasn't going to really miss out. I felt the full support of friends and I was relieved that they weren't treating me any differently. We swapped stories about travel plans, a passion we all share, and a friend asked me if I was interested in joining in on a trip. We have travelled together multiple times over 15 years of friendship. But when I contacted her to ask about specifics, she told me that she'd had second thoughts. That the trip wasn't for me. That she felt like there would be a lot of partying and she felt that I shouldn't come. To be honest, I felt so heartbroken and ashamed. Like a person that couldn't be trusted. That was being babied and infantalized. Or that I wasn't fun anymore and would ruin their trip because of my sobriety. I've been so low and on the verge of tears all evening. Has anyone had a similar experience? This is a friend who I trusted enough to talk about my sobriety and I feel like it's been thrown back in my face. I feel so pathetic and embarrassed. It's been a lonely year and it took a lot for me to accept this invite. It's my birthday tomorrow and I just want to hide from everyone. Like everyone is judging me. To be clear, my problem is not a daily thing. It is a binging problem, so I'm fine as long as I don't pick up that first drink. I can tolerate people drinking around me perfectly fine. I actually like that I can be there for them and drive them home. But all my positive feelings about my choice are giving way to shame, and I feel so alienated from my friends. It's like I'm being punished and excluded for making a positive choice for myself, one that doesn't impact them at all. I just don't get it. I haven't responded to the message and I don't think I can.. I have no words to express how this has made me feel and I'm scared of alienating myself further by being honest.

"(30/f) The day before yesterday, I slipped up and went to the bar and had three beers, ordered nachos to go, and went home. I was a bit eager to get home because I had, to my memory, a 1/4 bag of c*ke from my last purchase left somewhere near or on my wicker side drawer. Standard ‚Äúthis is the last time before I take a break or quit‚Äù internal monologue. 

When I got home I almost already had the zing I was looking for from that bag because I knew I‚Äôd walk straight to where I last put it and dive in so I could finally be rid of it, but it wasn‚Äôt there. I uprooted that general area in disbelief-I don‚Äôt lose bags. I managed to breathe and let it go for the night, but the addict mentality definitely lingered until the next day. I still want it, really bad.  It would have been fairly easy to call the right person up and fork the money out but I didn‚Äôt, and for that I will be proud. I don‚Äôt consider myself addicted to c*ke, but I‚Äôve been pairing it with alcohol for so long, it‚Äôs like best friends not hanging out at their favorite spot anymore, so I don‚Äôt separate them if I don‚Äôt have to. I‚Äôm typing this all out because this needs to be a part of my online accountability that I‚Äôve come to enjoy and look forward to these last couple of days. 

Before that day materialized, I was having a slow day at work when a certain celebrity and his wife came in my section to eat. I immediately knew who he was and got heart palpitations. It was weird that they were there, a nice but meager chain restaurant. Shortly after sitting down , they said they had to leave because their hotel room opened up, and politely said bye. The rest of the day that excitement turned into wanting a drink. I was watching this all happen kind outside myself, like whoa dude‚Ä¶if there ever was a marker for your personal problem, here it is. 

Work is getting slower with the school months and COVID and that makes me worry about money, even though I‚Äôm living with my boyfriend and am not expected to pay anything besides the electric bill. I have it good. With this extra time, there‚Äôs also a fridge full of beer and white claw beckoning my name in the back room. Most of you may say throw it out, and that would be wise but it‚Äôs not even my drink of choice and I‚Äôm the type of person that likes to leave and be out of my personal space when I drink. Hopefully it‚Äôs not too early in the day to say this but I want to sit with this discomfort and scream back at its face today.",alcoholicsanonymous

I celebrate my sobriety every month now. In the beginning it used to be every week.

Hope you have a nice day!",alcoholicsanonymous

I'm grateful that the Third Tradition only requires of me a desire to stop drinking.  I had been breaking promises for years.  In the Fellowship I didn't have to make promises, I didn't have to concentrate.  It only required my attending one meeting, in a foggy condition, to know I was home.  I didn't have to pledge undying love.  Here, strangers hugged me. 'It gets better,' they said, and 'One day at a time, you can do it.'  They were no longer strangers, but caring friends.  I ask God to help me to reach out to people desiring sobriety, and to, please, keep me grateful!

"And  I'm just writing it out here at the moment to try to remind myself what  it is.  Because I had this experience once on a farm in 2012 that  changed a lot of things about how I've perceived the world around me.  

I  realized, on my knees in the dirt, that the weeds don't come up at  random.  They come up exactly where and when they are supposed to, based  on heat, light, wind, nutrients, potential energy, all sorts of shit.   And just because I can't explain or control it doesn't mean it isn't  valid and true.  It's just true beyond my perceptions.  And there in  that moment as I came to this understanding, I, an alcoholic, could feel  the craving to drink lifted from me.  Because I knew I wasn't the one  driving the bus.

I have a higher  power, literally everything that isn't me.  The powers outside I could  never hope to understand.  So I tip my hat to the rest of literal  everything, or as I call it, what God is made out of.  My higher power  is literal everything, and I found it in the weeds in 2012.",alcoholicsanonymous

"i am temporarily living with my parents while i get on my feet financially. 

i really want to quit drinking. for good. however, my parents can‚Äôt seem to grasp the concept. they are 5:00 m-f and all day on the weekend drinkers. i do not pass any judgement on them for their consumption habits, however, they don‚Äôt seem to understand why i want to quit. they are aware that i struggle with my mental health and i have explained that alcohol consumption exacerbates it. that it is healthiest for me to put down the bottle for good. i tell them this and then the next night at dinner my mom will bring me a glass of wine. they seem to think i ‚Äúneed a drink for my stress.‚Äù 

i keep insisting that i have no issue with their drinking but that i need to do what‚Äôs best for me. and yet, every night, like clockwork, i am offered a beverage. they‚Äôll even buy alcoholic drinks specifically for me when they go to the liquor store. this makes me feel guilty and like i should be drinking.

i don‚Äôt understand. do they want me to drink because then they don‚Äôt have to question their own habits? i could use some moral support and validation that i should not feel guilty for turning down their requests. our family environment is very enmeshed which doesn‚Äôt make this any easier. it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre offended when i turn down the offer?

"Hey guys, 

New to reddit even though I've had this account for a couple years now, I don't even know if this is the place to tell my story I just feel like typing and needed somewhere to do it, I will sum it up for most part skipping a lot of minor details.

where to start

I grew up in a family of drinkers and I always told myself as a kid I would never drink.

I turned 13 and needless to say I tried my first drink and got my first buzz, it was amazing. the next day my father passed away due to heavy drinking for many years. I thought I was being punished by god for drinking so I swore it off for good, Until of course I turned 16 and the parties started in school. I met a girl and we dated for about 2.5 years until she realized I couldn't hold a job down because I was either too hungover or would just rather party

as the years went on I became a party animal, I lived off of FOMO (Fear of missing out) so I would never miss a house party at any cost. It got so bad I didn't even graduate high school as I was basically homeless by choice after my father passed away because I just couldn't be at home. 

more years passed and I entered my 20's going to clubs and bars every weekend and drinking very seldom during the week, I met a girl who I dated for about 5 years (started dating when we were 19) and again after years of not being able to hold a job longer then a year she had enough and we separated and I was an absolute wreck so of course I went on a bender for about a year but at this point I was still in control of my drinking, I could say no if I needed to. I was on and off working in the oil patch making good money if you're curious how I could afford to drink so much and I managed to put money away.

I was quite independent for the most part throughout the years, for instance, finding my own places to live, financing my first vehicle things of that sort, basic shit, things a normal human being should do.

Closing in on my 26th birthday I moved provinces to visit my mother, I had moved out of my own place and virtually had no home but staying with her wasn't an issue at all, I figured I'd figure it out, find a new job and get a place, well, that's where things really started to go down hill. I was jobless, on unemployment payments and I found myself with nothing to do but go to the gym, play video games and drink so, that's what I did and life at the time was GREAT! I was free and basically feeling like I was on an extended vacation. Instead of finding a job I tried to start my own business online and was determined to make it succeed so after drinking more and more steadily day after day burning through my saving I ended up relying on my mother to support my habit. This went on for about 3 or so years. Single. not a care in the world. thinking I'll succeed eventually but due to my drinking things as I'm sure you guessed it did not go well. After years of working my way up from a 6 pack of beer a night to 26+ ounces of straight vodka a day I found myself in hospital on my way to my first detox. To put it bluntly this also continued for a LONG TIME, years. I couldn't count how many detox centers I've been to on both hands, easily 12 or more. I've always had the mindset of I don't need rehab I can do this on my own I know I can but I couldn't obviously

I finally caved and went to stay with my sister back in the same province I originally came from in hopes of a new life as her and her husband were not drinkers, and it worked! I reconnected with the most beautiful woman I could ever dream of that I knew from high school. beautiful in the sense of inside and out. She was independent, owned her own home, had a great career a dog the whole package. WE HAD A BLAST together, I'm tearing up just thinking about it. I HAD HOPE! I thought this is it, I'm gonna start a new life, a REAL life, one with promise and success....BUT

I messed up.... again. I started drinking and showed my true self to the first woman I've loved in years, I fell for this girl so hard my mind is spinning just thinking of her, my guts turn. I got into it so bad that another ambulance was called for me in order to basically keep me alive. I had not been able to stop drinking. I had consumed so much alcohol doctors were surprised I was alive and of course. she left. I mean why would she stay. not only that but my sister, one of the only places I had to live kicked me from her home. luckily I had a brother who's spare bedroom I'm sitting in right now writing this.

IM BROKE. I've lost my money including my investments due to taking them out and burning them on drinking, I've lost my home, the trust of all my friends, siblings and even my mother, I don't have a career let alone a job, I've recently come out of ANOTHER detox center and I've ONCE AGAIN lost the love of my life all by the age of 31

I've heard of depression and people struggling with it, I've read stories and thought at times I might be depressed throughout my life but no.. I truly wasn't I was just sad, melancholic perhaps. I've always dealt with anxiety but this..... this feeling of complete emptiness, sheer hopelessness, staring off into the distance with the thought of will I even wake up in the morning and would it matter, I can't even begin to explain the pain in my heart and soul, a pain I've never experienced in my life. I'm afraid, I don't sleep I can't eat I'm starting to not even remember things because I'm in such a fog of self despair I just.... I don't even know what to say from here. The things I'm experiencing are things I've only ever witnessed in movies, Horrors movies

anyways this story serves no purpose other then the fact that I just needed to type and feel like I was talking to someone in some sort of weird way I guess. If you made it this far thanks for reading and be blessed. I hope I make it.",alcoholicsanonymous
"148 days sober. So, I've been having a bunch of dreams about drinking. In all of them, I feel bad or I'm being forced to drink. Hell, in one they poured beer all over me. But last night I had a dream that I had beer and I didn't feel guilty. I finished off two cans and got annoyed that I had to reset my ""days sober"" app on my phone. Been stressing a lot lately due to legal issues, not having a place (staying with a friend) and not having any money. I'm super tempted just to grab a tall boy and try to numb everything out.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi AA family :) I hope you all are well and taking care of yourselves!

During an AA meeting recently, I had, and I know this is very cheesy, a little bit of a burning bush moment regarding a weird experience I had within the first month of being sober. I consider my sobriety date to be December 13, 2020, but I also remembered within the last week or so a weird time when I attempted to smoke some weed less than a month into being sober. I know that that sounds ridiculous, but I think I flushed my weed when I first went into outpatient, and then I tried to smoke a bunch of ash that had collected where I was storing my weed. I didn‚Äôt get high, but I attempted to get high. Do I change my sobriety date? I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. I‚Äôm talking to my sponsor soon, but I‚Äôm also in the middle of a hurricane in my area so it‚Äôs hard to talk to anyone right now lol. I guess I just have a lot of time to think.

Any guidance of any kind is greatly appreciated!",alcoholicsanonymous
"So just had a great weekend at an AA convention and today when we got home my step mom (who is in recovery, or maybe just sober and not in recovery) said to me ""you don't know shit at 60 days"" in a condescending way, idk what triggered her to say that

But anyways I was thinking about it and there are people with less than 60 days who have gotten through the 12 steps and they sponsor people

so im just going to cut my step mom out of my life, she is not good for my recovery, she makes remarks all the time and kind of lords her recovery over mine, i just cant handle it anymore and i try not to catch resentments and I dont want to deal with her at all if resentment is in my future with her

i feel like she just needs to keep her side of the street clean",alcoholicsanonymous

"Made the decision to dump alcohol two weeks ago. Weaned off for a week to be careful not to get really sick from withdrawals. In just that time I already am seeing a brighter future for myself.

It‚Äôs just a start, but seeing some positive results from putting the in work is encouraging and I want to stay in this direction. It feels good to be positive again.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I made an introductory post last night explaining a bit about my situation, as well as having slipped on my goal to be sober, having made that goal the day prior. I‚Äôm going for a week goal today. I realize I should shoot for the moon here, but if I want to be accountable, I think being realistic isn‚Äôt a bad first start?

I‚Äôm going back to school towards a career in the medical field, and having accelerated an already present problem during quarantine, eliminating alcohol from my daily diet seems simply undoable now. I can‚Äôt even physically fathom a break anymore. I mean I can taste the release of those $3 Trader Joe‚Äôs bottles as I type this. I hate that I have to admit that to myself. More than the cravings, I want to do THINGS. I have wasted literally all of my 20s being a bar rat. The unsuspecting young woman in the corner, pushing them back, all on her lonesome.

I want to join a kickboxing class (I‚Äôve been planning this for weeks and been too absorbed in my feelings and drinks to go forward), I want to hike/walk trails I‚Äôve never done and be in nature (it‚Äôs dry and too hot here but apparently there are hidden gems), and I want to excel at school (I never wanted to before). These are just a few things I‚Äôd like to accomplish and do but the constant chime of beer o‚Äôclock rings loud and heavy inside, and for what? What is all of it but a buzz and the very thing you want to snuff out (memories)? 
I‚Äôd like to get to a point in life where I can go long periods of time where I don‚Äôt drink. I‚Äôd like to be free from these chains and be able to look back at this person I am and see how far I‚Äôve come. There‚Äôs a lot of shame and guilt that I ultimately need to talk to a counselor about, but for now it‚Äôll be whoever listens here. 
I won‚Äôt drink with you today.",alcoholicsanonymous

"relatively ""heavy drinker"" since i was 16. I am 20 now and can kill about 2-3 four lokos in the span of an hour and be totally fine. Buzzed and tipsy but not drunk. I want to quit completely. However i have also been fighting homelessness and self reliance since 17... i cannot afford to go to rehab. I have weekly car payments, insurance, medical debt, my own phone bill and a myriad of other problems. Currently, i am in TN and am staying with a girlfriend of mine. She has been gracious. I average about 3-4 four lokos a day, from the moment i wake up (yes even at work) to the moment im trying to sleep. I was wondering if anyone here had some insight on how someone like me can develop a method to truly taper off without well... the fatal results. Seizures and the like... i am on a mission to take control of my life but cannot afford to go to a 30 day rehabilitation center. I wish i could... but i cannot. I would drown in bills, car would be repossessed and my family mostly lives in florida and well.... doesnt like me so much. Im the hippie type, theyre the strict military type... i need help.

"‚ÄúWe A.A.‚Äôs surrender to win; we give away to keep; we suffer to get well, and we die to live.‚Äù

1. We SURRENDER TO WIN. On the face of it, surrendering certainly does not seem like winning. But it is in A.A. Only after we have come to the end of our rope, hit a stone wall in some aspect of our lives beyond which we can go no further; only when we hit ‚Äúbottom‚Äù in despair and surrender, can we accomplish sobriety which we could never accomplish before. We must, and we do, surrender in order to win.

2. We GIVE AWAY TO KEEP. That seems absurd and untrue. How can you keep anything if you give it away? But in order to keep whatever it is we get in A.A., we must go about giving it away to others, for no fees or rewards of any kind. When we cannot afford to give away what we have received so freely in A.A., we had better get ready for our next ‚Äúdrunk.‚Äù It will happen every time. We‚Äôve got to continue to give it away in order to keep it.

3. We SUFFER TO GET WELL. There is no way to escape the terrible suffering of remorse and regret and shame and embarrassment which starts us on the road to getting well from our affliction. There is no new way to shake out a hangover. It‚Äôs painful. And for us, necessarily so. I told this to a friend of mine as he sat weaving to and fro on the side of the bed, in terrible shape, about to die for some paraldehyde. I said, ‚ÄúLost John‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs his nickname‚Äî‚ÄùLost John, you know you‚Äôre going to have to do a certain amount of shaking sooner or later.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúfor God‚Äôs sake let‚Äôs make it later!‚Äù We suffer to get well.

4. We DIE TO LIVE. That is a beautiful paradox straight out of the Biblical idea of being ‚Äúborn again‚Äù or ‚Äúlosing one‚Äôs life to find it.‚Äù When we work at our Twelve Steps, the old life of guzzling and fuzzy thinking, and all that goes with it, gradually dies, and we acquire a different and a better way of life. As our shortcomings are removed, one life of us dies, and another life of us lives. We in A.A. die to live.

"Ah, where do I begin? I guess I can start by saying I feel a bit relieved finding this‚Ä¶subreddit? Im still new to Reddit and initially started one to use as a confessionary for my thoughts and tumultuous events as what I believe I am, an alcoholic.

I‚Äôm 30/f, and a self-diagnosed alcoholic. I think the only adult-like thing I‚Äôve done with this predicament is admit that to myself. Gone are the days where an alcoholic is just a middle-aged man in a suit and tie drinking Manhattans by 9am, we‚Äôre different shades and flavors now-which, honestly is probably more interesting too.

"Hey guys! I'm very new to this so I thought I'd start by giving a bit of a background...

I started drinking when I was about 10 years old when me and a buddy found my parents liquor cabinet, after that it was game over. I was drinking copious amounts of vodka and filling the bottle up with water thinking my parents wouldn't notice, etc etc. By the time I got to high-school I was sneaking liquor into school every day. I went to college and it got worse, I got to a point where I was drinking a liter of booze a day... and somehow I graduated with an engineering degree.

Anyways, I've been feeling alot better about my habits recently and have been able to keep it somewhat in control.  Playing guitar has been the best escape for me, but sometimes even listening to certain music triggers me into falling back into horrible habits.

I know this sounds stupid, but is there like a surefire way I can keep myself from drinking? I don't wanna do this anymore and idk how to stop myself.

"I CHOOSE ANONYMITY

We are sure that humility, expressed by anonymity, is the greatest safeguard that Alcoholics Anonymous can ever have.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 187

Since there are no rules in A.A. I place myself where I want to be, and so I choose anonymity.  I want my God to use me, humbly, as one of His tools in this program.  Sacrifice is the art of giving of myself freely, allowing humility to replace my ego.  With sobriety, I suppress that urge to cry out to the world, 'I am a member of A.A.' and I experience inner joy and peace.  I let people see the changes in me and hope they will ask what happened to me.  I place the principles of spirituality ahead of judging, fault-finding, and criticism.  I want love and caring in my group, so I can grow.

And what is worse is that my twin brother left the family because of her and she continued to pick on me even more. Before she died the last thing that I ever said to her was to drop dead. And she did. Their some parts that miss her and the other parts is I don‚Äôt miss. The truth I don‚Äôt miss her at all.üòá",alcoholicsanonymous

"So I've been apart of this community for awhile now and I can't help but consider un-joining. There seems to be a large number of preachy, judgmental people that have presumably been sober for years that seem to intention seek out newcomers and tear them down. Not sure if it makes them feel superior because they have 20, 30 years under their belt, or what. But I feel we have to remember that no matter where we are in our journey, we all started exactly the same. Whether we're a day sober or 10 years, no one should feel superior or inferior to anyone. 

This leads me to my next point. I've seen a lot of people on this Sub comment that AA seems like a cult. I don't believe it's a cult and I do plan to go to my first meeting in awhile this Tuesday at my local church. But I understand and accept that it's not for everyone. If someone is an atheist or just doesn't like the group setting they shouldn't feel pressured to join AA. I know tons of people that got sober without AA. It's not the one and only solution to sobriety. Don't try to shove it down someone's throat if it's just not their cup of tea. 

CONTEXT: this has happened three times now and I actually had to block a fellow Redditor for just being a combative, argumentative jerk. For context, I decided to quit drinking on Thursday the 12th. That Sunday I had a massive gallbladder attack (very severe pain, 10/10 EASILY) that landed me in the E.R. Turns out a stone was blocking my bile duct and it needed to be removed immediately. I had my entire gallbladder removed that Tuesday. I was stuck in the hospital for 2 days. Due to the covid surge I couldn't even get my own room. I was stuck in the E.R. for 2 days. I wasn't allowed visitors. My phone died. No TV (obviously). The doctors also talked to me about my alcoholism and detoxed me. I was all alone with just my thoughts. It very much felt like an inpatient rehab. The doctors scared me straight and told me I'd have liver cancer and failure in 10 years if I don't stop. It was my rock bottom. Not to mention my current boyfriend almost left me right before my hospitalization due to my drinking. My life was basically threatening to fall apart. This just cemented the fact I no longer have a choice. I HAVE to quit. 

I've quit cold turkey before. Without rehab. I went 9 months without booze when I was pregnant with my daughter who is now going on 3. I probably had the strength to not start up again but sadly I did. I went through a lot of trauma with my ex husband and the divorce from hell that caused me to start drinking again. I've quit for months at a time in the past 3 years, but this cycle seemed unbreakable. I've been seeing a therapist regularly every other week, but to ensure I don't go back to that darkness I plan to go to AA. My first meeting is this Tuesday and I even have a friend going with me to hold me accountable. 

But this isn't good enough for some of the snobs on this Sub. I've been asked by THREE different people why I've waited two weeks to go to a meeting. They've insinuated I'm ""making excuses"" or I ""don't really want to quit drinking"". I even got told by one person that I'll NOT go to this week's meeting and postpone and postpone. This is simply not true. And 2 out of 3 people backed off when I explained that I just had a MAJOR surgery. I've been given 2 weeks off work (actually the doctor added a few more days because I was recovering SLOWER than expected). I could not sit up straight or even walk without intense pain up until yesterday. I was doped up on various meds which I've only been able to cut down on in the past couple days. I made plans to go to an AA meeting once I PHYSICALLY felt up to it. But this one rude guy kept insinuating I was making excuses and not ready to quit. Um, I've gone 2 weeks and 2 days without it and I already made plans to go to a meeting this Tuesday based on my physical ability to manage my current pain threshold. But I think this guy was projecting or just wanting to argue. 

Clearly these people have never had a major surgery like having an organ removed. Like what, should I have asked my local church to host the AA meeting in the post-op unit of the hospital?

I don't know. It just makes me mad that I'm sitting here trying to recover and people are jumping down my throat. I'm not even allowed to lift my own toddler for another 2 weeks, and have temporarily moved back in with my parents for help with her because my boyfriend works crazy hours. My parents have been supportive and held me accountable too. I voluntarily surrendered my ID to my boyfriend to remove all temptation and my parents have gotten rid of all alcohol in their house as well. So I have a strong support system. 

I just don't understand the mindset on here of ""you need to go to a meeting and you need to go to one NOW. NO EXCUSES."" Like I said, I personally do plan on attending a meeting this week (and no I'm not backing out, hence why I found a buddy to keep me accountable. I also plan on asking for a sponsor). But I can also see why some people don't like the idea of it or consider it to be a ""cult"". It's not the end-all be-all and you can't say every single alcoholic on the planet MUST join AA if they have any hope of quitting. It should be respected that it's not everyone's cup of tea and different things work for different people. And I certainly don't think I deserved to be attacked because I didn't get off my bedridden butt to attend a meeting even though my pain was so intense I could hardly walk for an entire week and a half.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Before I got sober, I hurt my family being drunk often.  I brought strife onto them, pouring on the liquor night after night, I didn't give a crap about anybody but myself.  With nowhere for them to go, my hateful disease held them hostage in our home.  That's was more than 2 years ago.

Today, I'm working with a dear friend in very early sobriety.  Just after returning home from an AA meeting last night, their spouse was drunk - angry drunk, and started throwing furniture onto the lawn.  They're young child was there and the home was filled with fright.  It reminded me this hateful disease of alcoholism is still at large.  Ruining families and breaking the hearts of children.  It seems hopeless, but my own early sobriety had similar challenges.  Change is hard, and scary sometimes for those around us, especially a spouse who also drinks.

I persisted with my AA program regardless of how troubling things got at home, going to meetings nearly every day and talking with my sponsor.  I couldn't solve the problem that my spouse was going to keep drinking, sometimes in my face, but my Higher Power could!!!  I had no idea it was coming.  About a year into my sobriety my spouse said, ""I'm done with drinking"" and walked away from it.  We don't fight over nonsense anymore.  My kids don't say, ""Please, stop fighting, go to bed!  Your just saying the same things over and over and it doesn't even make any sense.""  We're still together and it's a happy home on a regular basis. 

I'm grateful for the program and for the people here that taught me how to live sober, without the crutch of a drink.  Before AA, I believed it 'as a fact' that I could not live without drinking and today it's the entire opposite, I could not see living any day with drinking.  For me, alcoholism is just too hateful to those I love.",alcoholicsanonymous

"
In the face of your own conflicts, so not try to drink or dope, trying to escape from your own mind, because from every undue absence you will return to the damage or needs that you have created in the intimate world, in order to heal them. It is very common that in the face of emotional pressures we feel as a result of the problems that disturb our peace, we seek relief from alcohol and drugs. This escape is capable of generating greater damage in our journey, which we will be forced to heal, under the weight of greater suffering. It is necessary to think about the cost-benefit ratio. The apparent benefits that alcohol and drugs offer, anesthetized our Dad and distressed mind for a few minutes, so not compensate for the serious physical and spiritual harm that will be.generated. We will always return with a greater amount of disturbance after the chemical effects of the drink and narcotics cease. Furthermore, very often the drugged or drink person does things that, in good conscience, he\she would never do, bitterly regretting their lack of common sense, and sometimes for the rest of his\her life. We will be better off seeking relief from reliable sources. Prayer calms the heart, calms the mind, produces physical benefits, as it relaxes tensions, and still allows us divine inspiration to overcome our pains. Reading high spiritual works opens the window of the mind and supplies the spirit with renewing ideas, changing the psyche for the better. The work of helping others link is to the divine currents of love, from where we will extract the necessary energies to assess our difficulties. We will find peace in prayer, in the meditation of divine truths and in the work of love for the others. If we do all of this, we will be taken by the master to the sky of serenity, and we will no longer need to sink into the Hell of drugs or alcohol.",alcoholicsanonymous
"So my last drink was Thursday the 12th. I had a gallbladder attack the following Sunday, was in the hospital 2 days, needed the gallbladder removed on an emergency basis, and was released that Tuesday. The doctors also talked to me about my addiction and detoxed me. 

I haven't really had time to think about drinking since my recovery. I was given 2 weeks off work as well. But yesterday my family and I went out to an event (my first time going out since the gallbladder episode) and there was beer everywhere. I felt like I was gonna crawl out of my skin. But I didn't fold. My family was kind enough to abstain as well. 

But today the cravings are back. First time having cravings since this whole thing started. So I have ordered non-alcoholic beer. I've heard mixed opinions about this. Most the people I've talked to that I know PERSONALLY swear by it and said it helped them quit in the early stages whne cravings were still running rampant. On the other hand, I've heard other people on the internet claim it made them miss the real thing that much more. 

Anyone have any experience with this? And yes I am going to AA meetings starting this week (that seems to be the go-to comment whenever I post in here, so might as well establish that now lol).

Thanks in advance.",alcoholicsanonymous

"[21 F] I‚Äôve struggled with alcohol for a long time and have been in deep denial about it. I started drinking heavily in high school I was in a bad friend group, when I took a break from alcohol suddenly nobody wanted to hangout with me. I started getting excluded as soon as I wasn‚Äôt getting liq and supplying everyone with a place to get fucked up. I have always had self esteem issues and mental health issues. major depressive disorder, anxiety, ocd, and borderline personality disorder alcohol has been a crutch for me and a way to keep friends around me. I self sabotaged for years and didn‚Äôt see my drinking as a problem I thought I was just having fun. It‚Äôs not fun when you start and can‚Äôt stop. I don‚Äôt drink very often maybe 3 times a month but it always escalates when I do. You plan on one drink and have 10+ 
Alcohol has enabled me to make terrible decisions. I had a rough patch in my relationship and instead of working on it I binge drank and had an affair. I hurt myself mentally so much over the past few years with bad decision making and self hatred. I‚Äôve hurt the people closest to me, I‚Äôve lost good friends, I‚Äôve embarrassed myself, and I‚Äôve wasted so much money on alcohol. It‚Äôs so hard to get sober when everyone around you wants to party. I always start the night having fun and progressively get worse and lose control. My anxiety and ocd are terrible after drinking the hangover sweating panic feeling like I had done something awful, convincing myself everybody hates me I ruin everything and I don‚Äôt want to be alive.

"Hello. Im 20, ive had my first drink when i was 13 and started actively drinking sice 17. Recently I broke up with my girlfriend of two years and that just made things much worse in every way, i have this routine when i buy alcohol, drink alone, contemplate suicide, hurt myself, write a lot of drunk texts and then feel like shit the other day. After breakup my ex told me that I have an alcohol problem and that made me question if Im really an alcoholic, but the thing is i can perfectly last even a week, sometimes even two without getting drunk, but then it usually comes back with full force and i get extremelly wasted. Right now I am experiencing depression from the breakup and i tried going sober for 10days but when Im drinking I dont feel the pain so i fucked it up yesterday which made me really question the fact that I might have an alcohol problem. About half a year ago I started drinking alone which i considered to be the lowest bottom and here I am with a hangover and writing on alcoholicsanonymous. 

I might just have some controll problem or idk, i guess what im trying to find out if i really have an alcohol problem and if i should search for help.

"Hi, so I've been taking antabuse for a while now, the first time I started taking it i went 2 months without drinking until the thoughts came into my head - What if I skip a day and drink the following day etc, anyway I did that and then drank 4 8.2% cans of cider, needless to say my face went beetroot red, terrible migraine, eyes glazed, nausea, and everything else so from then on I knew even after waiting a day the terrible reaction would still be there. 

I have a question to anyone else who has been on antabuse, I'm a month sober and completely happy with my recovery with minimal urges either.. I'm wondering if anyone has tried alcohol free beer, cider or wine while taking this tablet and if they have had any reactions at all? I'm not asking because I'm craving alcohol in any way, I'm asking for social situations including dates.

Any help or advice on this would be great. I wouldn't want to drink an alcohol free beer and then all of a sudden have a bright red face for the following 2/3 hoursüòÇ

"So I've been sober for a few months now, and this is from years and years back. The relationship was awful, the guy had left bruises on me but he taped me and I just saw it and it was terrible.

I was belittling him and repeating myself and raising my voice and demanding sympathy... just horrible behavior. I had not idea I was like this when I was drunk. I even called a friend who had seen me that way and she was saying that it was bad at the worst part of my drinking but even before I totally stopped it had improved over the years. 

I have PTSD and I'm sure that influenced it but I'm just shocked. What I really want to know is how do I go on after seeing this? I can't believe I'm the person talking like this. How do I live with myself? How do I know I'm not just secretly a terrible person and the reason I see what I see on the screen is evidence of that?",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hey, so as the title says, I've told myself I'm not doing it. I can't get rid of the thoughts today though and they're overwhelming. I've essentially got a ""free pass"" where nobody would know I was drinking... i could get away with it without issue.

Times like these are the worst when I'm on my own and there's no chance of others knowing I drank. I feel like maybe I'm not not drinking for others and not myself maybe.

This happened 7 months ago when I was actively drinking where I partly tried to stop and I almost killed myself in an accidents alone. That night, for the entire day, i had the same feeling. The plan was set but, I told myself i won't. Until it was 15 minutes before the last store closed and I realised I wouldn't be able to buy vodka after that time so I rushed out to get some.

"I guess I just need somewhere to vent. My brother called me at 2 am this morning and was crying said he messed up. I knew from the moment I heard him speak that he was fucked up. I asked him what happened bc I went to the worst scenario in my head. However, he said he was outside in the drive way and that he couldn‚Äôt get up. I go outside to find him on his bottom crying. He said he thought he broke his leg and I immediately checked his car. Nothing was wrong with it. I knew he didn‚Äôt get in a wreck but I was filled with rage on knowing what could have happened to him or someone else. I asked him if she drank and drove and he told me no, but knew it was a lie bc his car wasn‚Äôt there when I got home. He also has some history of doing it but my mom usually caught him. He knows what a DUI or killing someone can do but yet he continues to do it. He tried to tell me to just help him to the bed and he‚Äôll sleep it off. Only for me to see that his ankle was off to the side. I told him we had to tell out parents can call 911 because his ankle was broke/fractured. He started crying bc he knows that him doing this is stressful for my parents since we had an uncle pass away from unaliving himself and my grandpa recently fell and broke his hip. I guess I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and find an excuse to why he drinks himself to such a belligerent state. Because quite frankly my parents are GREAT parents.

I have 4 days off work coming up and will use those days to detox and deal with the withdrawals. Today and tomorrow I am going to taper down to help with the withdrawals. 

I started off with hard alcohol and mixed drinks but now I'm a steady beer drinker. Getting off it would do so much for myself and family. I'm just so worried about the withdrawals but won't see my Dr because of certain fears I have. 

I hope by next week I can come here and say I've been 1 week sober and feel proud of my accomplishment. 

My SO is happy I want to quit but won't quit themselves. So I also need to deal with that. I need to look in the mirror and practice the word ""no"". No, I don't need a drink.

"Hey all, I have a curious question for the recovered alcoholics in this sub Reddit. I have been sober for 7 years, I got sober at 19.

My girlfriends parents are very traditional conservatives and throughout our relationship have made multiple side handed comments about alcoholics and drug addicts. These comments have been extremely negative and naive and they basically think they are horrible people. They also have idea that parenting and having a strong family is what is most important and alcoholics most likely have horrible parents. I am planning on getting engaged to my girlfriend this year and have even asked her parents for permission to marry their daughter.

I never saw anyone (doctors or meetings) coz I was in absolute denial that I can just stop anytime and that everyone is drinking like that.

"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn‚Äôt know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

I recently lost my boyfriend and I‚Äôm miserable and I feel like I deserve to live life as an alcoholic and it‚Äôs the only comfort and relief I get from life. At the same time, all my boyfriend wanted for me is to get sober. So I want to do it for him, I owe it to him, but I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve it. 

So, can I go to AA? Do I belong there? I kind of want to stop and kind of don‚Äôt and I‚Äôm still drinking but I want to keep going to see if something finally clicks.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi all, my name is Ali and I'm an alcoholic. The 24th of August was my three year sobriety birthday after a 27 year ""career"" and all the destruction that comes with it so no need to go into detail. 
I live in Lebanon and we only have one group, and as fate would have it it was a 10 minute walk away. I went religiously for a year and a half and took up a service position and couldn't believe the changes in me, neither could my friends and family. So, covid happened and I lost my business and all my money, that took a huge toll on my marriage which ended last year after we were both affected by a massive explosion that destroyed half Beirut, the flat I was in was literally blown up and I walked away with a few stitches. Now 5 years ago, any one of those would have had me binging for weeks, all together I probably would have died of alcohol poisoning. And throughout everything, two things an old timer always stuck in my head. Think it through, and if it's totally out of control how is alcohol possibly help. 
So my point is, life is random and can be very hard, and we have to accept life on lifes terms, but as alcoholics that is never ever going to be a solution. 

God bless you all",alcoholicsanonymous
"I need some advice as I'm a young closeted alcoholic and have no one to turn to, I'm also afraid of being told I'm over reacting because my problem isn't as serious as some other people's. 

So for background I'm 25/female from the UK. I've been a secret binge drinker for the last 3 years, my family and boyfriend have no idea about my problem. I was drinking 3-4 bottles of wine across the week, almost always on an empty stomach to get drunk fast. The thing is I've now gotten some form of ""control"" over it and now only have 2-3 drinks across the whole week, usually a large glass of wine but again always on an empty stomach. 

I still feel like I have a problem though and can't kick the habit for good no matter how hard I try. I've had breaks of a month here and there and I always feel better but then eventually a life event happens (good or bad) that triggers the desire to have a drink again. Even just after one drink I feel woozy for the rest of the night and get aches/cramps/stabbing sensations around my liver and always have a mild hangover the next day. It makes me feel like shit but I can't stop this cycle of yo-yo sobriety and drinking. 

Even though I know I'll never go back to my old days of heavy drinking I still want to find the strength to quit for good to stop the anxiety that I'm damaging my liver. Like I said my loved ones have no idea so I can't talk to them, I'm contemplating getting professional help but I'd want it to be discrete as I don't want anyone finding out about it. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for me?",alcoholicsanonymous

When World War II broke out, our A.A. dependence on a Higher Power had its first major test.  A.A.'s entered the services and were scattered all over the world.  Would they be able to take the discipline, stand up under fire, and endure...?

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 200

I will center my thoughts on a Higher Power.  I will surrender all to this power within me.  I will become a soldier for this power, feeling the might of the spiritual army as it exists in my life today.  I will allow a wave of spiritual union to connect me through my gratitude, obedience and discipline to this Higher Power.  Let me allow this power to lead me through the orders of the day.  May the steps I take today strengthen my words and deeds, may I know that the message I carry is mine to share, given freely by this power greater than myself.

So I messed up and hit the wagon hard for about 6 months now. Just quit 2 days ago. And I‚Äôm currently sleepless again but this time it‚Äôs coming with horrible hallucinations and I feel like voices are talking to me. I googled it but was wondering if anyone else came into this problem,alcoholicsanonymous
"Hate life. Hate being here on this fucking planet. Have for as long as I can remember which I guess is why I started drinking all the time, doing heaps of drugs, and cutting myself. Did it help? No, not really. But it did pass the time. Made me feel like I could see myself just waiting to die rather than feeling like I was always a month or two away from killing myself.

But now I‚Äôve stopped all that shit. Haven‚Äôt done drugs for about 6 months. Haven‚Äôt self-harmed for 4. Haven‚Äôt had any alcohol for 3. Did it cause it‚Äôs all you fucking hear as an addict, shit like ‚Äúyou gotta stop, you‚Äôll feel so much better!‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never get where you need to be while you‚Äôre doing that shit!‚Äù. And maybe it‚Äôs even true in some cases.

Think the thing people forget is, I did that shit because I hate being alive. Suicide didn‚Äôt just feel like it was in the cards, it felt like it was the whole fucking deck. Like my next draw was it, I could delay it, but it was fucking inevitable. 

The therapists couldn‚Äôt help. Not DBT or CBT or EMDR or fucking any of them. It was all just fucking words at the end of the day. I‚Äôd take the suggestions, journaling, meditation, breathing exercises, the fucking mindfulness and practice ‚Äòem, I mean really try, for at least a month, but still, sweet fuck all in the results column. 

Pills were the same. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, didn‚Äôt fucking matter. When through dozens and dozens of the fucking things. None of them did anything, not a fucking thing. Not even one pesky fucking side effects. Zilch.  

So then I started self-medicating. Maybe it‚Äôs just cause I was so fucking numb all the time I just couldn‚Äôt tell how much I was suffering but I felt better. At least in ways. Didn‚Äôt have relationships to ruin, and for sure didn‚Äôt start new ones, but I could at least tolerate talking to people. Could tolerate being at work, can‚Äôt do that normally. Shame it‚Äôs hard to go unnoticed doing that shit at work though so I still couldn‚Äôt *hold* a job. Made a couple things better at least.

But then I stopped. Cause people I used to know told me I should. Only they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed. Then I stopped again cause those fucking people have instilled their fucking ideas in my head now and I can‚Äôt escape the fucking guilt and shame anymore and addiction is basically ruined for me. Thanks, fuckers.

But now I‚Äôm worse than ever. The medication still doesn‚Äôt do a fucking thing. Therapy is still just fucking useless words. Everything still fucking sucks and I still think about killing myself 24/7. Still exercise everyday, eat well, try to do shit, but it doesn‚Äôt fucking help one iota. And now one of my only options, becoming an addict to numb it all away, is gone cause of the fucking guilt. 

And the fucking therapists and shit just pat you on the back and tell you how fucking ‚Äúproud‚Äù you should be for kicking the addictions. Like it fucking matters. Like them being proud translates to you in any fucking way. Like you don‚Äôt constantly wish you could throw the guilt away and go right back to it. Like it‚Äôs made any fucking difference in your life whatso-fucking-ever. They just act like you made it through hell when in reality, you‚Äôre caught in the worst fucking hell yet. And then they dust off their fucking hands and act like the hard works all done, at least the bulk of it. But it fucking isn‚Äôt. Feels like I‚Äôve lost ground, like I‚Äôm a few steps *before* square one now. 

I just fucking hate this shit. I don‚Äôt understand what my brain is fucking waiting for by not letting my just up and kill myself. I don‚Äôt know why the fuck I can‚Äôt do it when it‚Äôs all I wanna do, when I don‚Äôt have any fucking hope and I don‚Äôt fucking care if it‚Äôll ‚Äúget better one day‚Äù.",alcoholicsanonymous

I'm spread so thin and get overwhelmed so easily. How tf am I supposed to do this? My craving for alcohol is through the roof today since it's back in my system. Exhaustion is my biggest trigger- and here I am. Utterly exhausted. I honestly feel too tired to even come up with a solution...

Though they knew they must help other alcoholics if they would remain sober, that motive became secondary.  It was transcended by the happiness they found in giving themselves for others.

Those words, for me, refer to a transference of power, through which God, as I understand Him, enters my life.  Through prayer and meditation, I open channels, then I establish and improve my conscious contact with God.  Through action I then receive the power I need to maintain my sobriety each day.  By maintaining my spiritual condition, by giving away what has been so freely given to me, I am granted a daily reprieve.

"I celebrated two months of sobriety this past Monday. All the meetings I go to are at the same club at about the same time. I‚Äôve been going there consistently for almost three months now. Because of this, I often run into the same people and I‚Äôve gotten to know the people at my meetings really well and have already made some good sober friends. About a month in, I developed a crush on a long time member of the club with over 20 years of sobriety. I made a move and we ended up hitting it off instantly. We started hooking up every week or so. It was great except I found myself becoming a lot more self-conscious about my appearance at meetings than I was before we started hooking. I got a little too focused on making sure I looked attractive to him at every meeting that it really started to distract me from the purpose of why I was there in the first place. Then I started to wonder if other people in the meeting noticed I was trying to put my effort into my appearance and that made me self-conscious as well. On top of that, I am friends with a really beautiful young woman about my age who obviously gets a lot of attention at the club and the guy I‚Äôve been talking to has admitted he finds her really attractive. They are also good friends and I find myself getting really jealous whenever he‚Äôs near her or talking to her. It‚Äôs like the feeling of jealousy comes on so quickly and aggressively I can‚Äôt even process it and I‚Äôm just instantly seeing red. I hate that I feel this way because she‚Äôs a really sweet girl who‚Äôs earnestly trying to work the program. She‚Äôs also just going through a lot. We should be on the same team supporting each other especially because our sobriety dates are so close and I feel awful about these jealous feelings. I just constantly find myself comparing myself to her. These feelings got so overwhelming one night, I found myself leaving a function early when I saw the two of them sitting together. I decided after that point that I needed a break from meetings at that club. I promised myself I‚Äôd keep up with meetings and find other places to go but I‚Äôve fallen off severely and I know that‚Äôs putting my sobriety in danger. This club just became a default place and safe space. When I didn‚Äôt know where to go or what to do I went there and could always find someone to talk to. Now I‚Äôm so afraid and anxious to start up meetings there again. I‚Äôve changed my appearance drastically (I shaved the side of my head to support a co-worker undergoing a brain surgery) and now I‚Äôm really worried this guy won‚Äôt find me attractive if he sees me. But I also feel like by not going to the meetings, I‚Äôm losing so much of the social support and connections  I‚Äôve built up over the last few months. Not sure what to do. Idk if my anxiety will let me show my face at a meeting there for a while. I‚Äôve been telling myself I‚Äôll feel more confident going to a meeting there after I‚Äôve lost 15 more pounds  (I know sounds ridiculous). 
Yes, I have a sponsor and she was supportive of my decision to take a break from meetings there but she also really wanted me to stay on top of my meetings if I were to go elsewhere and I haven‚Äôt to be honest. I‚Äôm only on step 3. I know there‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt know. Just looking for a little experience, strength, and hope in this situation.",alcoholicsanonymous

But I never use this as an excuse, and rarely as an explanation because I feel so guilty for blaming alcohol but I might as well mention it on here because it is still part of my story... Alcohol used to make me angry, so so angry. I was angry before but it made it worse. Because of this, I would basically ruin all my friendships and relationships, out of revenge for small things they'd done to me, I got back at them by doing worse. And justifying it with 'I'm hurt because of you so I did this...'. I never told them that though because I knew it wasn't good enough. That didn't stop me from acting out anyway though.

Sometimes I wouldn't need a reason to act out, I just would and I can't explain my thoughts, other times I did have a reason. Either way I know I caused damaged, consciously or unconsciously. I think that those people in my past have moved on from it now but I can't be sure, we don't speak anymore. Maybe they're still hurting. But all I know is that guilt eats me up everyday, so much. I wake up, think about it, go on with my day, still thinking about it, go to sleep, still thinking about it. It hurts so much I can't forgive myself I don't know why it's so hard to though.

Over the past few years however, he's become more aggressive and violent towards us whenever he drinks (we are an Asian household and it's common for us to still live under the same roof until we get married, etc so we see all of this happening).He gets especially aggressive towards my mom because she would try to stop him from walking out and going to the liquor store. He's shoved, pushed, and knocked her down before when she tried to get in his way. My mom is 4'8, no more than 90lbs who tries to go up against my brother who's 5'7 over 200lbs. She's ended up with bruises and bloodied parts because of it. I've been knocked down unconscious before because I've gotten in the way between them as he was about to strike her. We live in a gated community and on several occasions, he's tried to break into our neighbors' homes, has blacked out in front of our house/the nearby community park and the cops would show up to either tell him to go home or take him away for overnight jail time. He's also been to the hospital several times and can go MIA for months until he'd show up on our doorstep randomly.

My brother is currently in his drunk phase after being sober for months. My sister and I have always told him that we wouldn't let him in the house when he's drunk and we've stuck by this rule for years. But my mom will always bring him food and water and has snuck him in the house before so that he could use the bathroom/shower when we're not home/away at work. We've told her that every time she does this, she helps enable his behavior because she's always there to cushion his fall.

My brother can be such a wonderful and smart guy, but when he's drunk, he can be the most reckless, selfish, violent person. It literally feels like a flip switch when he's sober and kind as opposed to when he's drunk and unruly. I'm extremely afraid of my mom getting hurt, especially with her being so small and frail. I really don't know what to do. Of course I've offered to take him to AA, attend it with him, offer to pay and take him to rehab, I feel like I've done and offered all that I can to help him but he has never accepted it. And we would threaten to call the cops on him when things got really bad, but my mom would lash out on my sister and I because she thinks of it as us turning our backs on him.

Can anyone please help give me any advice on what I should do? To either help my brother or confront my mom? Every time I try to make her face reality, she would always say, ""you're not a mom, you wouldn't understand until you have a child of your own.""",alcoholicsanonymous

"This is my first post here. I have been sober since Sept. 27, 2020. On Sunday I saw a new drink at the corner store near my house called Day Trip. It's a non-alcoholic CBD drink. There is no THC in it whatsoever and there is no age requirement to buy it. I felt mildly relaxed after drinking it and slept really well. I noticed I kind of started to have obsessive thoughts about CBD and started researching CBD oils, vape pens, etc... and then I bought 4 more of the CBD drinks and drank one while doing some compulsive eating behaviors (yeah I'm in OA too...)... then I noticed this heavy feeling behind my eyes like I used to get when I abused THC... so I started panicking and self-destructively drank all 4 cans in one sitting. I didn't feel remotely high and the heavy feeling behind my eyes went away but now I feel so full of resentment and like did I just throw away 11 months of sobriety? My sponsor tells me it's between me and my higher power but that's not the answer I need. I feel like I'd rather die than start a stupid fucking day count all over again.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hi Everyone, 

I'm really struggling and thought I can post here. I had 14 months of sobriety and I relapsed on August 13th. Since that day I have been drinking two bottles of wine a night. I hate myself. All my anxiety and depression returned in full force. 

For context, I am only child from a family who is extremely emotionally abusive. They can never love me for me and always want me to change myself. I just feel absolutely incapable of making any good thing come from my life. They constantly tell me that I am disgusting and they don't know what they did in their life to deserve a kid like me and that I cause them so much pain and they want to die because of me. This is primarily the reason why I started drinking again. I just couldn't handle the pain and sense of overwhelming fear that I would never be able to live up to their expectations and that I would be a failure. 

For the last few days, my drinking quickly escalated. I was drinking the wine and couldn't control any of my emotions anymore. I was sobbing to anyone who would listen. Now I am extremely embarrassed because I seem like a freaking mess. I'm scared that I would be judged and that I would be disliked by the people around me. 

My family also realized that I relapsed and now they are saying that they will not survive me putting them through this constant agony. 

I want to stay sober. I want to pull myself out before I sink further, but I have so much fear. I am so scared that things will not be ok and I am scared to face the pain. I got so anxious about the relapses and being so openly not ok in front of people. I hope that I haven't blown it with them and I hope that I can get better and show up for others like they have for me. 

I don't know where I am going with this whole post, but I just hope that things will be ok and that I can find the strength to stay sober again.",alcoholicsanonymous

"THE GIFT OF BONDING

Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 63

Many times in my alcoholic state, I drank to establish a bond between myself and others, but I succeeded only in establishing the bondage of alcoholic loneliness.  Through the A.A. way of life, I have received the gift of bonding - with those who were there before me, with those who are there now, and with those yet to come.  For this gracious gift from God, I am forever grateful.

I drank everyday for a year and a half and made bad mistakes including assault. I recently crashed my car under the influence and am lucky to be alive. I lost 30 percent feeling in my face and will never be able to smile normally again as well as lose of strength and mobility of my arm. Details of crash arnt important but I‚Äôve always known I drank excessively and idk what to do about it. Just putting this out there don‚Äôt know what will happen.,alcoholicsanonymous
"You have to trust people to tell them your life isn't going so well. You then have to trust those people again and even more so when you tell them your life is doing better. Because to do better there must have been bad to begin with. To make things better you have to do something positive. 

Everyone here today is having a positive effect on everyone else present. Whether you speak or not. You are all equally important. We are all here for our combined issues with alcohol and through each person speaking, through every story shared, through every little smile, whether seen or unseen, we are helping each other heal a little at a time. 

I heard an interesting thing the other day that made me think a little harder than I normally would. And it's this: ""Who we are right now often seems to be the most important thing. Its not. What's important is who we can become."" 

As alcoholics we often think selfishly. It's always me, me ,me. And yet within that me me me mentality there is still a sense of community. A community of voices all speaking at once inside our heads. Will I have a drink tomorrow? Do I have enough money to drink tomorrow? Will I go to the shop early or maybe later in the day when the hangover wears off a little. Do I buy extra so I don't have to go out again the day after? These are all questions I would quietly ask myself every single time I had a few days off between work. It was always a conversation to myself. No one but me.

But even as selfish as those thoughts were. It was still community that we all have within us. A different level of thinking that goes beyond the present and the selfish here and now. We all think about tomorrow, the day after that, next week, next month, and next year. 
It is hard to say this and I'm sure I'm not the only one who at one point in time accepted that there would be no tomorrow. At some point in life we would be left alone, cold and bitter but it would be alright because alcohol would always be there as a companion. A companion that can't buy happiness, only rent it, but it will always be there as a way to climb out of hell. Or more honestly, to fall deeper into it. 

But thankfully, what I have come to realise over the last few months, is that ultimately, we have control. Looking back I often drank because the world around me was too busy, too loud, too chaotic. I grew up too quick and unaware to me, I drank to drown out the stress, the pain and the hurt that life threw at me. And at some point, what started as a coping mechanism became an addiction. And that addiction rapidly grew into a powerful demon. And I gladly called on that demon for over a decade to help deal with lifes struggles. 

And yes my demon and I had fun together. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't fun sometimes. I could tell you all stories that would make you laugh and smile and the majority all start with a drink. But that's the worst part. Those stories almost always start with a drink. The truth is I had an abusive relationship with the devil that is addiction. 

But at some point, all bad relationships face a fork in the road. We all have a choice as to where that road leads, and I have made my choice. I choose to live, free and happy. Despite a few setbacks, and more than a few bumps in the road, I am in control of my own destiny. Sure, I can choose to let this poison that is addiction continue to dominate who I am. Or I can fight back for the little community that lives inside me. The good selfless side that I ignored for so long. The one that tells me to be a little kinder to people despite how they treat me. Because maybe they are having a bad day? Maybe I can clean up after dinner even though I cooked the meal? Maybe the others in my home are too full from my delicious cooking. Just maybe somewhere along the line I can help someone else who is struggling along their own road and in doing so maybe my road will be a little easier to walk along.¬† I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that maybe if we took a little more time to listen to what is going on around us, we wouldn't find the world so loud.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I am a high functioning alcoholic. When I'm drunk most non-alcoholics would never know I'm drunk. But a few hours later, once the acetaldehyde has begun accumulating, I feel like I could just drop right into a coma. After the acetaldehyde has mostly converted to acetic acid I feel like I'm slowly dying but otherwise fine.

Why does the acetaldehyde phase effect me more severely than the ethanol phase?",alcoholicsanonymous
"I am 29. I have been sober for 759 days now. I stopped drinking cold turkey because the last two times that I drank, my hands would shake, I felt physically sick for a few days after I would drink, and my anxiety for the next week or two would be through the roof. I felt like something bad was going to happen, in a funk, panicky, it just got to a point where I asked "" Why do I keep doing this. Fuck this."" So I stopped drinking. Initially I thought I would just take a few weeks off from drinking, but then weeks turned into months, and then the pandemic hit and it made it easier for me to stay home, not go out with friends and drink. 

BACK STORY: Before I quit drinking, my early to mid 20's I  was in college, drank a lot, partied a lot, and looking back, I also blacked out a lot. A very social drinker. I never drank on my own, or had cravings for drinks, I only drank at parties or social gatherings. However, when I would drink, I found that I would often overdo it. When I was young and in college, I did not notice how drunk I would get because everyone else seemed to be just as drunk as I was. Once I was out of college, my drinking slowed down dramatically, because I was going out to parties less, working full time, etc. But when I would hang out with friends, I would drink in excess. Luckily, at this point in my life, I was a ""happy drunk"". I would dance, have fun, laugh, be very outgoing, but just really drunk. 

This all changed after my father passed away from cancer in 2016. Immediately after he passed away, I started dealing with some really bad depression. I still wouldn't drink on my own, or crave drinks, but again, when I did make myself get out the house to meet up with family or friends for dinner or drinks, I would overdo it, but this time id be emotional/crying and blacking out, just an emotional mess. One of those nights included me blacking out at a bar, waking up with my head cracked open, vomiting all over myself in the hospital, and needing stitches to close the gash over my eye. Till this day, I don't remember what happened. And to be honest from 2016 to 2018ish maybe even into 2019, there are nights that I do not remember at all, where there are pictures of me out with people having fun, but I have no recollection of those events. I think it is a combination of the severe depression along with the alcohol, where I just can't seem to remember months at a time. Honestly it is all a blur.

So fast forward to 2019, in early July I went out to brunch for a friends birthday. This was the first time where I noticed after two drinks my hands began to shake, I felt really paranoid, and in retrospect I think I was having a panic attack. I did not know it at the time but looking back, I think thats what it was. After this day, I took about two weeks off from drinking, until my cousins 21st birthday that we were going to celebrate in Las Vegas. First night out, I felt fine and happy, but after two drinks, I immediately black out and cannot remember the rest of the night. The next morning my hands were still shaking, my anxiety was crippling and I could not leave the hotel room the entire day. I went out at night with everyone since it was the last night, but I didn't really drink and tried to play it off as best as I could. July 27th, 2019 was the last time I drank. 

So July 2019, I stop drinking cold turkey, and figure ill take some time off from drinking. I still smoked weed at this point, I found it helped with my anxiety, helped me sleep at night, and it felt good to smoke and listen to music (which is one of my passions in life), watch movies, etc. However, once the pandemic hit and everything was closing down, my only outings twice a month were for groceries, and weed. One of the days, the line at the shop was long, and I started thinking, if I get COVID from being at this weed shop and I die, or someone in my family dies, that will be the stupidest shit ever. I still bought weed that day, but stopped smoking  soon after (385 days with no weed). 

So I have been sober from alcohol 759 days and weed 385 days. 

I have gotten used to not drinking in smaller social gatherings since, however, I have two bachelor parties coming up and two weddings coming up. I feel like I am in a way better place with my anxiety and depression. I have been considering drinking, because I feel like I am in a better place. BUT I HAVE SOME DOUBTS &amp; QUESTIONS. 

**I apologize in advance if these questions trigger anyone, I do not know where else to go and would appreciate any advice or help.** 

My questions:

How do you know if you're a person that should never touch a drop of alcohol ever again? 

How do I know if I am in  ""a better place"" only ***BECAUSE*** I'm sober or if it is my mental health that has improved and I can drink again? 

How can I know how I will react with alcohol if I don't see how I am with it in my improved current mental state?

I truly appreciate any of you that read this entire post. Thank you.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi. I am not an alcoholic but I love drinking in a social setting. But recently, in the last year or so, I have had episodes where I drink too much and lose all memory of certain periods of the night. And that's when I become really aggressive and abuse my friends. It doesn't happen all the time but whenever it does, I would have no memory of it. I don't even abuse all my friends, but I pick on 1-2 people in a party and say the most inappropriate things. I have tried to moderate my drinking but my body/system doesn't give me a signal, like I wouldn't even feel slightly sick if I have had a lot of alcohol. I never puke as well.

"Hello all!

So my boyfriend introduced me to his best friend/work buddy and his fianc√©e (Mary). All four of us are addicts, sober dates ranging from two years and up.


His best friend and Mary have two kids, ~6mo and ~2.5yrs. They were able to go to meetings with the oldest, but the youngest is a bit more fussy. As a stay at home mom, she's not able to leave the house much and not able to bring the kids to meetings when the boys go together. We all went on a week vacation together and Mary expressed to me she really misses meetings and is hard on her not to be able to go anymore.


I would really like to offer to come over while the boys are at meetings, and maybe do a small meeting with just us. 


Meetings were never really my ""thing"" but I gave a good shot and believe that even if it isn't the best option for me that they can be semi-helpful. The only reason I bring this up is because I have no idea how to ""run"" a meeting, and do not want to share this suggestion with Mary just to leave her with all the logistics. 


I understand the basic set ups of a meeting, and could probably fumble my way through making a schedule where we read passages of the big book and talk about them every week, but I would love to have it be more ""interesting"" than just reading literature. Or if it's just reading, is there a better way to set up when/ what parts of the book to read?




Any suggestions on additional things we could do/read or suggestions on how to break up the big book would be great! I am going to be posting this is narcotics anonymous sub and probably be looking to include their literature as well.

"Im posting this so maybe it will be some sort of motivation for my future and so I do not go back on what I say for the final time. Let me begin by saying that the town I live in does not help, neither does my job. Both are alcohol related. I drank only a few times a year before I moved here, and afterwards it became a daily thing which has now come down to weekly, with sometimes multiple times per week. Last night i went all out because i was off today and the amount and varieties that i drank is absurd. I felt horrible this morning and on top of that, i decided to cook food at 2 am and left the food in the oven and fell asleep. I guess one of my roomates caught it or i drunkenly turned off the oven. The dreams where horrible and made me think i was loosing me mind. I will no longer convince myself that any hangover is worth it. I‚Äôve had enough. Back in February I was sober for 3 weeks and it was the best I felt financially and mentally in a while. I think the hardest part is telling my friends no, when they ask to go out.. simply because i know i‚Äôll see them less now that i have quit. It‚Äôs a sacrifice I have to take.

"A RIDDLE THAT WORKS

It may be possible to find explanations of spiritual experiences such as ours, but I have often tried to explain my own and have succeeded only in giving the story of it.  I know the feeling it gave me and the results it has brought, but I realize I may never fully understand its deeper why and how.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 313

I had a profound spiritual experience during an open A.A. meeting, which led me to blurt out, 'I'm an alcoholic!'  I have not had a drink since that day.  I can tell you the words I heard just prior to my admission, and how those words affected me, but as to why it happened, I do not know.  I believe a power greater than myself chose me to recover, yet I do not know why.  I try not to worry or wonder about what I do not yet know; instead, I trust that if I continue to work the Steps, practice the A.A. principles in my life, and share my story, I will be guided lovingly toward a deep and mature spirituality in which more will be revealed to me.  For the time being, it is a gift for me to trust God, work the Steps and help others.

"Well on Wednesday and Thursday I got really drunk, off Happy Dads and let me tell you I am not happy now. I don‚Äôt remember much since I basically drank all day Thursday 8Am to 9pm. As well as using cocaine, which idk why I had been sober for over 6 months from that. Well I ended up calling and cursing at my dad while he was at work. In short, I cursed him out and insulted him I took a few low blows with my insults apparently. I also yelled at my mom and insulted her.

My dad, well me and him have a rollover coaster of a relationship. Some days I hate the damn guy other times I feel some sort of pity I don‚Äôt fucking know. I feel sad that he has to deal with me and he works so hard. Then I think of how he treats me, how he called the police on me and I think ‚Äúthat guy isn‚Äôt your friend, look what he did‚Äù. I think of how he forced me through college, when I told him early on about how I was robbing and drinking because I already had a drinking problem at 17. Then at times I think I feel sorry for him, after all he gives me work. I just hate how he speaks about it like he owns me.

With my mom sometimes I just get so frustrated at how she talks. She lives in a make believe land. She thinks one day we can all move into a big house and live happily ever after. When I already told her I don‚Äôt even want to eat dinner with them let alone even hear them. To make things worse she now records me whenever I‚Äôm drunk to try and shame me. I HATE being recorded, I HATE cameras in general. I literally don‚Äôt give a shit about what I did or say especially when I drunk. I don‚Äôt want to remember that crap. My ego or just thoughts are just so negative, I just even find ways to shit on her cooking. Like it‚Äôs to greasy, or hey you are using vegetable oil from the fucking food drive. I feel bad, but then I hate when she tries to tag team me with my dad. She tries to make me feel bad. 

Today in our AA meeting we discussed the 8th step. I have hurt my family a lot with my drinking. So I tried to apologize. Me and my dad haven‚Äôt spoke since Thursday. He started to cry and said I hurt him emotionally after I tried to apologize. Well I didn‚Äôt feel a tad bit bad, honestly. I just said ‚Äúthis fucking guy‚Äù. In short, it turned into a hour long conversation and he said he didn‚Äôt have no hard feelings towards me but that he was done with me. Part of me is relived because I am done with him as well, thankfully I have a good job lined up. I don‚Äôt need him. I ask myself, as I recover:

‚ÄúDoes he really care? He didn‚Äôt even say happy birthday last Sunday. Is he acting to try to make me feel bad? Is he REALLY done with me? Is he good or bad friend for that?‚Äù

I also think: ‚Äúfuck these guys [mom &amp; dad] I can‚Äôt wait until January so I can move out, block them and never speak to them again.‚Äù

The 8th step talks about, from my understanding identifying who you hurt and being willing to repair those damages. I did my family the worst, but I am not ready practice forgiveness, real forgiveness to them and myself. I still have some built up negative emotion towards them and I need to analyze where it came from and how to get rid of it. I don‚Äôt speak at my meetings but that is what I had built up inside of me as I heard others speak. 

I never want to hurt them, but like I said I need to analyze my emotions and hope that I‚Äôm due time our relationship betters. The road to recovery is long, but like today, just for tomorrow I won‚Äôt drink. Happy 24 hours guys. Thanks for reading my post.",alcoholicsanonymous
"So, my story is that I started drinking a lot in college, and I left with some lingering chronic health issues that I believe are from the drinking. However, clearly most people who drink as much as I did don't get the same health effects, so there might be some underlying reason it happened to me. Or perhaps i'll learn that it's more common than I know. Here are my symptoms that won't go away:

GERD.

I have severe acid reflux. I take prilosec daily. If I eat certain foods, or too much food, I will get a lot of acid reflux and want to throw it up. I can't really survive without a PPI because it would be very uncomfortable. 

I sometimes have these very weird burps that happen after I eat, that sound very different, like I'm letting out a lot of air.

In addition to this, I have some sort of IBS/IBD?

Basically, from my knowledge most people that have acid reflux, it doesnt effect their ability to eat food. But for me. I get full really quickly now, or definitely quicker than I used to. So i get bloated, and have early satiety. Of course, certain foods (i suspect fried/fatty foods, breads, etc) cause it more than others, but yeah.

I also have some sort of Anal Fissure, or something that gives me sharp pain, but only sometimes, when I poop. It hurts when im consipated, or sometimes even when its these small thin poops it hurts the most which I don't get. But I guess fiber is key. This very well could be unrelated to the drinking, but I felt I'd list it because it might have to do with the gut problems.

I suspect my stomach lining got fcked from the alcohol, and thats part of the reason for this. But any input or advice would be cool I guess. Might be the wrong subreddit for this, but whatever.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hi, first time visitor and poster. Just looking for ways to keep myself accountable and I don't really have a sobriety support network. Nobody knows I have a drinking problem let alone anything else (former opiate/whatever I could get my hands on abuser). I can't really admit to anybody close to me that this is the case because of a lot of reasons. I don't think anybody would suspect that I'm an addict, I guess that's probably the case with a lot of people? 

I'm nearly 4 days sober, giving up alcohol and cigarettes this time as I want to stay healthy and alive for my 6 year old. A few things happening within the last year have caused me to abuse alcohol and other things whilst remaining ""functional"" but miserable. I convinced myself that HEAVILY drinking every single day was normal and okay. My mental health has always been poor generally and if I don't get sober this time I know that I won't survive one way or another. I'm very new to this lifestyle, having tried and failed before and I'm overwhelmed with information and feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water.

" Here is my story:

&amp;#x200B;

It is coming together as a big picture. 

It all start a year ago when my father threatened to murder me on a military base in Ontario, near the capital region of Canada where I was living at the time. Or maybe the story starts with the war in Afghanistan, or 9/11 because I swear my life has been fucked up ever since that day. 

 My father told me he would slit my throat and that he had killed 17 people and would kill me too, would not hesitate, and is very good at it. I hid in my room for two days then forced him to drive me back to the city where I lived and never saw him again. A few weeks later I went to my home city because my sister was getting married and started reaching out to family members for support and action. Every single person silenced me. My grandfather instructed me to stay silent to protect my father, my sister told me if I had a problem I could leave forever. My uncle told me it is normal for a man to act that way, my aunt did nothing, and manipulated me into getting over it. A cousin would stay dead silent everytime I spoke about it. Anytime I spoke about it people would talk about putting me in a psychiatric facility.

 7 ish months ago I finally called the Military Police. They intimidated me, told me I could not give a statement, and sent me to a police department they knew would not help. I tried my local police, they said they were sending officers to interview me, they never showed up, never called, were supposed to call. I gave up for a long time. A week or so ago I decided to start speaking out against the family members who silenced me and told them if they did admit to the coverup and help me find support and take action I would go to the police. They started calling the police on me every time I spoke about the abuse, the coverup, and telling them I was a danger to myself and crazy and attempted to intimidate me, silence me, delegitimize me, and confine me to a psych ward. But the police started believing me immediately and the next day I filed a full police report. They called the police on me again, told my story for the 6th or 7th time and convinced them I wasn't crazy. Later that night the police call, tell me It's all over, there will be no investigation.

So I call another department. They refuse to help. So I call the FIRST department, military police where I had started and they take me seriously STRAIGHT AWAY. I have an active case number. My family told me I'm crazy, that they never were going to stand up for me and I belong in a mental hospital and then all blocked me. Everyone. Aunt uncle sister cousins grandparents ALLL GONE. But I have an active police investigation and an independent journalist who is interested in my story.

 I have contacted all three major Canadian news stations but have not yet heard back. My father is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and he has PTSD and is unstable and is dangerous to himself and the public. I have seen him threaten people in public so many times. they did NOT protect the public.

 I told my family I will not stop speaking out against the way they coverup child abuse. We have a family history related to this: My mother's father murder her mother and committed suicide in front of his children and they REFUSE to take this seriously. Infact my uncle, her brother told me it is totally normal for a man to do that to his family. 

So I am returning to the capital in one week and beginning to fight a lengthy legal and media campaign against my father, My entire extended family network on both sides, my police, federal government, and military. I will attempt to organize with other discarded veterans and military families in the capital. I lost my job due to stress. I am now penniless. Nothing left in the world, but someone has offered me a place to stay and i had travel points saved on my card.

At one point I became so hopeless I am almost drank myself to death and wound up in a detox centre. Which ended up being a great thing because as of last week I am 4 months sober.

That is my story.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Title says it all. For a while, the thrill of being sober was enough for me. It was magic. Literally everything in my life has gotten better. Everything. But now I have the blahs and find myself finding fault with everything and everyone in AA. I still attend meetings everyday but am not feeling a connection anymore. I do not currently have a sponsor. My temporary sponsor and I had a falling out about a month ago and since then, I have been going downhill. They suffer from big mental health issues which I was not quite aware of. This resulted in them lashing out at me one day and being really verbally abusive to me. I stood up for myself and we parted ways. I have since made amends on my side and accepted my responsibility but never got a response or amends from them. Now that I‚Äôm writing this, I think that has been very depressing to me because it makes me feel like everything they had been teaching me and preaching about was complete bullshit. I guess I‚Äôm still angry with how I was treated?  I see this person everyday in my home group and keep expecting an apology or something and I get nothing. Ugh. Obviously this is a resentment. They have shared about this situation to the group and admitted they screwed up and treated me awfully but nothing directly to me. I need to get a new sponsor stat and work this out. Any advice would be appreciated.",alcoholicsanonymous
"By the grace of a power greater than myself maybe I get to wake up tomorrow with a full 3000. 

So grateful for this subreddit. My sobriety has taken me to lots of wonderful places around the world. And in many of them, as where I‚Äôm living now, I‚Äôm the only one showing up at the meeting and keeping the lights on. Sometimes I see some new faces. Other travelers. Sometimes people stick around. 

And if it wasn‚Äôt for these small commitments I would surely be drunk. 

I‚Äôm grateful to keep the lights on today. And if there‚Äôs anyone in the south of Japan that needs a meeting, I‚Äôd be grateful to know you. We can do what I can‚Äôt. 

Thanks all.

"I 19f, had been drinking heavily, going through 1.5 liters of vodka in about 3 days, for about 6 or 7 months. I have not drank in a month, and during the first week I was having pretty bad withdrawal symptoms. Since then, I have slowly gotten better, but i still have some very prevalent symptoms. I have the sense of falling, and have been diagnosed with BVVP, but I have eye pain, along with just a hollow sensation in my spine. My depth perception has also taken a toll and I feel very weak and jerky. I also randomly feel heavy and feel close to passing out. Is this just withdrawal? I am having a hard time adjusting to these new health issues and am worried that I will have to live like this for the rest of my life. Any insight would be appreciated, Thanks.",alcoholicsanonymous
"So...  I just picked up a year yesterday. 
I was asked to speak at a meeting tomorrow night and I have been avoiding it for a few weeks. I finally decided that I can‚Äôt keep putting it off as I need to give back to A.A. as it did for me. 

I am super nervous as when I get anxious I get scatter brained and will lose my thought. 

I need to try and keep it simple but I also have like 45 minutes to fill... 
What it was like, what happened and what it‚Äôs like now. 

Any tips or advice? It has been bothering me the past few days and there is no way around it. 
I need to get out of my feelings as it is not about me. 

Should I rehearse? Write out my story just to get an idea? Or just bust in there and go with it ?

"Hello,

I quit back in February, and last week, I decided to enjoy a drink or two. This resulted in me drinking to a point of blacking out, and then I went on to drink for the entire week afterwards, untill this last Thursday. Now I am going through quitting again. 

I am just wondering what your thoughts are, as I got confident in my sobriety and ability to control my drinking. And as a result decided to try and develop a healthy relationship with alcohol, where on occasion I can enjoy a beer or two. I currently can't decide if it's possible for me to do that, or is it all me lying to myself so that I eventually make an excuse to start drinking again. 

Thanks for any thoughts.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I've suffered alcoholism when I was about 18 until about 22 years old (I'm 24 now). My peak was when i was 21 and would drink over half a quart straight to myself in a night, almost every night a week.

Since then i had to stop due to it affecting my anxiety to the point i would pass out (panic/anxiety attacks) which led me to the E.R. It also gave me a stomach ulcer. I went through psychosis, and derealization and depersonalization really bad.

I felt like sht and it had a negative impact on both my mental health and physical health. I would over share personal stories that I am embarrassed about to this day. It affected my relationships. I remember i woke up in the middle of the night on my bathroom floor in front of the toilet with the lights on, unable to remember when I fell asleep or got there. Oh and it was putting a dent in the wallet.

I miss how it made me feel more numb and it helped with my body aches. My mental state might have been impaired but i felt like i was living in a dreamlike fantasy that I've always wanted to feel. I felt peace in a ""fake"" way. It let me escape. It was there to help me in my darkest times when i felt the most alone. When i was feeling so empty, numb and trapped in a complicated situation/relationship. 

I haven't drank besides the one or two in the past 2 years. I feel better but damn there has been nights where i would reallly want to drink and tonight being one of them. I feel like i can drink every now and then and i feel like i can control myself as i learned self discipline. 

Unsure how to go about this. Just a vent tonight it is.",alcoholicsanonymous

At 24 years old, nearly a decade after my first drink, I‚Äôm realizing that I am an alcoholic and that I WILL destroy all of my relationships if I continue on this path. Last night I got angry with my husband and I tore into him, for almost no reason at all. I was belligerent and cruel and just flat out mean, and for what? He is the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me, and I chose to hurt him. My journey starts today. I could use some kind words or advice. Thank you in advance.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I‚Äôve been drinking since I was 16 years old, I‚Äôm 32 now. I‚Äôve damaged relationships along the way and recently the girl I wanted to marry had to end our 2.5 year relationship. She has a 10 year old and me a 13 year old so we were a family. It was the kick in the butt I needed to get myself some help. 
I recently started going to AA slipping up once in my first 2 weeks but being honest with myself and not beating myself up too much about it. I‚Äôve been trying to hit a meeting a night even though my desire right now is not high. 
I just miss my family, I miss my home (living with parents again at 32 sucks), miss all the good times we had even though I contributed to some bad ones. My ex loves me but just couldn‚Äôt be in a relationship with me the way things were going. I know I need to do this for myself first, my 13 year old daughter needs me to be present but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that the damage is done with my ex and it‚Äôs going to be hard for her to drop that wall again.

"SEEKING EMOTIONAL STABILITY

When we developed still more, we discovered the best possible source of emotional stability to be God Himself.  We found that dependence upon His perfect justice, forgiveness, and love was healthy, and that it would work where nothing else would.  If we really depended upon God, we couldn't very well play God to our fellows nor would we feel the urge wholly to rely on human protection and care.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 116

All my life I depended on people for my emotional needs and security, but today I cannot live that way anymore.  By the grace of God, I have admitted my powerlessness over people, places and things.  I had been a real 'people addict'; wherever I went there had to be someone who would pay some kind of attention to me.  It was the kind of attitude that could only get worse, because the more I depended on others and demanded attention, the less I received.  I have given up believing that any human power can relieve me of that empty feeling.  Although I remain a fragile human being who needs to work A.A.'s Steps to keep this particular principle before my personality, it is only a loving God who can give me inner peace and emotional stability.

That 4ish? year relapse almost killed me, and definitely killed every important relationship I had. This is what happens when an alcoholic is active in their addiction. Nothing and no one is sacred or protected from the consequences of their choices.

I fight daily to have half of the strength my disease does. (Yes, it‚Äôs a disease) The almost 20 years of sobriety I had were no match for my alcoholic make up, even with all of that time and knowledge of my issues under my belt. I talked myself into the insanity and made the choice to drink. üòû My disease was far worse than it was in my 20s almost immediately. üòû

I‚Äôm STILL trying to rebuild all that I lost. I share my struggles and victories publicly today because I fell flat on my face publicly - I want the world to see that I‚Äôm trying, I‚Äôm working, I‚Äôm doing everything I can to just do the next right thing - and this shit is HARD!!!! 
Trying to repair broken trust and build new foundations in to old relationships that have been tarnished, is fucking hard! But, I wake up each day determined to keep doing the next right thing, and no matter what, I don‚Äôt take a drink. When life gets too lifey, I now have healthy tools and resources to utilize, that get me through the moment.

I am Michelle. I‚Äôm a wife, a daughter, a sister and a mother and I‚Äôm an alcoholic in recovery, recovering publicly and loudly for all to hear and see in hopes of saving one person from having to go through some of this shit, or of helping someone who‚Äôs currently in it. You can do this!

All of this is shared with love. I always hope my words help someone, but ultimately I am the one who benefits the most from sharing my experience, strength and hope. 
For that I am so very grateful.",alcoholicsanonymous
I will never admit or submit to a god or higher power. I don‚Äôt want the circle jerk of AA. But I know I have a problem. Is there any hope for me?

"I don‚Äôt know where else to post this, I‚Äôve looked up different subs and they seem either super pro sober or pro drinking. And I don‚Äôt have the balls to actually go to AA in person. So I‚Äôm gonna post this here. 

I‚Äôm gonna wake up tomorrow with a throbbing headache, filled with regret and disgust about myself. Cause I drank again. I hate and love the bubbly feeling in my stomach but I can‚Äôt seem to stay away. I feel like a masochist, maybe I enjoy the feeling of a hangover cause it reminds me that I‚Äôm alive and I feel something. Sounds so dumb but I feel the greatest when I‚Äôm on the verge of dying.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Sup dudes. Feeling adequate currently as a result for my previous binging actions. Put down 1L of 80 proof over the last 7.5 hours, I am a bigger dude so this isn‚Äôt a record breaker for me.

My game plan tomorrow is to go ahead and try a harsh Kratom regiment. I am 25, 6‚Äô2‚Äù 260lbs, 3-4 year history of hard abuse. Main abuse started with benzos and transferred to alcohol when I hit legal age. Never had an issue with opiates (why I‚Äôm choosing kratom) but I have recently developed issues with acute pancreatitis which is no fun.

I‚Äôve done the AA stints, had more than 3 months sober, 2 and 1 month streaks sporadically, still get DTs, and am sure I‚Äôll be in full blown psychosis here soon.

What I‚Äôm asking is do you guys have any good advice for what I‚Äôm about to go thru? Any good bring-me-ups? At 25 I‚Äôve done this probably too many times before and I know it‚Äôll be hell. Just looking for some words of encouragement before going into this. Bender has probably been a 3 week long one with better moderation than before. I know I‚Äôm gonna probably be up for 24 hours sweating it out and having immense stomach pain from the pancreatitis ‚Äî just need some encouraging feedback to get me thru this.

So I‚Äôve been to rehab before and they tell you there not seek counselling/therapy until you‚Äôve got a year sober and not to start a course of treatment until one year.

"I have had a history of blowing up my career over my behavior and drinking at work events or work trips. 

On the day to day, I usually don‚Äôt think much about alcohol because I am so busy taking care of my kid and I try to stay fairly healthy/balanced, yet work stuff always leads to trouble.

I‚Äôm most likely an addict‚Äî if I do get a drink it‚Äôs never just one. I have so many past experiences that I can‚Äôt tell even my closest friends out of shame. My co workers always end up kind of shocked because I am usually a shy, conservative female until I get a few drinks in me. I turn into a really loud, belligerent idiot and I usually end up being overly sexual, crude, embarrassing, etc. Not sure if it‚Äôs the anxiety about traveling mixed with the anxiety I already have about socializing in general, but work trips always make me a train wreck of a human. I just needed to reach out and see if others struggle like this because I‚Äôm in a really dark place right now.",alcoholicsanonymous
" Since I was told that  I had the  disease of alcoholism in May of 1996 I have struggled to stop binge drinking and blacking out. I knew early on that the key to understanding alcoholism was in Jim's story in the big book. I suggest you read this story so you can relate to my post. Jim had this foolish idea that he could drink whiskey if only he put it in milk. Now the key word here is **foolish** as Jim is not a stupid or ignorant man. This is called **foolishness** and how did he get to this point? Deception, **self- deception** to be exact. Now if you have read the story what comes next? Destruction, **self -destruction.** One more journey for Jim to the asylum, the same one he just got out of and a good chance to loose his family. Only to wake up remembering the insane idea won out, asking ourselves **how it could have happened again.**  My take on this insanity **(extreme foolishness)** is the drink is always after the self deception. It is a closed loop system that feeds back onto itself with self deception and self destruction asking myself how could this have happened to me again only to repeat that same process again in the not so far distant future. It is a learnt process that for me was very hard to get out of. In my opinion this parasitic processing of thinking is the addiction and the result is alcoholism. From my experience once I stop drinking this mode of processing is self adaptive and I start to do other foolish behaviors only to say what am I doing, full of anxiety and my foolish idea of having just one only to wake up and say to myself how did this happen to me again. **I wonder?**  When will this end?",alcoholicsanonymous
"I work hard.  Try to live well.  But trust with my family eludes me.   I've been in the program for 3 years with two relapses.   My wife says she can never trust me alone....although she remains a drinker.   My kids are very sharp yet very disrespectful towards me.   I'm glad I don't use this as an excuse to drink but I feel like I make little progress in achieving trust.    I'm not abusive, violent just a self isolating and pitiful drunk.   I'm sober now and I know I sound or read full of self pity.  I just feel I'm lacking progress is all.   Just wanted to share and thank you for reading.

"TV Isn't working tonight, reminds me of a post here describing a terrible rock bottom with a TV not working during a hospital stay.  Got me thinking about what an alcoholics bottom experience can look like. My counselor in rehab had spent a number of years in prison for murder. A guy asked me to sponsor him so we went for a walk in a park where he soon told me he had murdered his children's mother. Another guy cornered me after a meeting for some one on one, he thought he  was some kind of special case that couldn't use what had worked for me. Saw in the news later that he had murdered his grandmother. I don't think any of them got up in the morning, got dresses and thought "" I think I'll kill somebody today."" 

Sure there are some Netflix documented whacko's who just aren't made like the rest of us but the incarceration industry relies mainly on people just like us-drunk. A thousand danger signs ignored, a thousand false starts and broken promises.

When I admit my powerlessness over alcohol, I admit that I am one drink away from those three guys. I use AA to build as much distance away from  their  thinking as I can. Guess I'll read a book instead of throwing a drunk at the TV tonight.",alcoholicsanonymous
I‚Äôm 27 and have been a pretty hard alcoholic since I was 17. To the people around me I live a good life. I have a good job and an amazing girlfriend of 3 years. But what people don‚Äôt know is I have been arrested because of my drinking around 8 times. I totaled 3 cars when blacked out drunk. I never got a dui but I have been charged with leaving the scene of an accident multiple times. I want to be happy and put this bullshit behind me. Every time I go sober I feel so fucking terrible and start drinking to feel better. It‚Äôs not the physical withdrawals that bother me. I could care less about the shakes but it‚Äôs the emotional shit that gets me. I have a sense of impending doom and I feel like the biggest piece of shit when I start thinking about everything I‚Äôve done.,alcoholicsanonymous
"As the title says, today is my 18th birthday. But my dad is too drunk to even be able to remember it. It hurts.

You wanna be able to remember your kids 18th birthday. This was supposed to be my day.

Why I still get surprised when he does this. Well, he always does it but this day is the worst day yet. I thought for once he could drink a little less than he usually does since it‚Äôs my birthday. I‚Äôm not asking for him to go completely sober but I just wanted for him to be able to remember this day. If you can‚Äôt go sober for yourself then do it for your kids.

"If you're in very early days and questioning why this or that isn't going right yet or it's tough well it's normal.

If I was speaking back to my early sobriety self, and I've been drinking for the last ten years of my life then all of my problems aren't going to go away after 10 hours or days of not drinking! 

So if you're here that's great, you're in the right place, we've got you and things will work out.

Realistically, things don't transform at a click of the fingers in any walk of life and AA is the same. I'm not patient or disciplined but one thing I do know is things cannot get considerably worse if I continue not to drink and accumulate days of sobriety as I'm doing. The one thing I cannot do today is take a drink

"M 21

I've been hanging in the background of this subreddit for the last few weeks. For the last 2/3 years my drinking has been getting completely out of control. I always told myself it was just a phase, it would sort it's self out. Of course this didn't happen and was just classic excuses.

Two weeks ago, i had a very bad night because, as usual, the party never stops for me. I kept drinking and drinking. Saying nasty and vicious stuff to my girlfriend, close friends etc. I swore off drinking, still believing I wasn't an alcoholic. After two weeks of no drinking, this all took a turn for the worst last night.

I met up with an old friend to go jam at a studio. I went to a pub for a few while i waited for her to arrive. When she arrived, i went into a local shop and bought 5 cans to take with me. The session went pretty well. She dropped me off in town after and i went to another pub. It was actually a good time, met some awesome people. When the pubs shut and it was time to go home, my mood turned sour. I knew i had to go home and face my girlfriend and my best friend who would know I'd been drinking. I got mad at myself, anxious and eventually arrogant, telling myself i was completely fine to drink like this. When i got home, i kicked off, grabbed a bottle of something that had been in the cupboard and drank it in 3 gulps.

My neighbour was in and she was trying to calm me and help me. In my drink fuelled rage, i wanted to go out and find a fight for some reason, so i started grabbing weapons, a long jacket, boots etc. It gets hazy after this but i didn't leave the house. Next thing i remember was being alone in my living room, paranoid my neighbours partner was wanting to hurt me.

This morning I've woke up and as much as my GF and BF are upset and hurt, they completely understand and have been really supportive. My neighbour hasn't spoke to me but i have sent a message apologising. I grabbed my phone came straight to this subreddit and i'm finally able to admit that i am an alcoholic, I'm not in control and i need to overhaul my life, the people in it, the places i go and most importantly, not to have that first drink again.

I'm not sure exactly why I've wrote this but it feels good to admit it. Like a weight has been lifted but i know there is still a lot of work left to do. I know the hardest part is in a while i can't let myself get too comfortable and convince myself that i can drink again and it'll be fine. I know won't be.

Thank you if you've read this far. If anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated as i know advice is crucial with this kind of thing.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Hello, 

I've just past 14 months no alcohol and 18 months no cocaine. I joined a zoom meeting AA group in February, and I have not participated but I have gotten so much from the speakers sharing their stories each session. I've probably been to 150 meetings since then. 

I haven't done the program properly in regards to doing the steps or getting a sponsor, I have resistance to jump in fully as I feel like a fraud because I'm not completely clean. 

I have long term serious diagnosed depression, and have been medicated for it. I also take an weed edible a few times a month as it doesn't trigger self destructive behaviour for me.. I generally order some take out and watch a movie. 

I guess what I'm asking for is feedback on whether I can participate if I'm committed to not drinking alcohol or using cocaine,  those substances were my downfall and I've recognized that. I keep coming back to the line ""the only requirement is the desire to stop drinking "" , but I don't want to piss off a group if they become aware that I sometimes use cannabis. 

Thanks for any feed back.",alcoholicsanonymous
"WE JUST TRY

My stability came out of trying to give, not out of demanding that I receive.

- THE BEST OF BILL, pp. 46-47

As long as I try, with all my heart and soul, to pass along to others what has been passed along to me, and do not demand anything in return, life is good to me.  Before entering this program of Alcoholics Anonymous I was never able to give without demanding something in return.  Little did I know that, once I began to give freely of myself, I would begin to receive, without ever expecting or demanding anything at all.  What I receive today is the gift of 'stability,' as Bill did: stability in my A.A. program; within myself; but most of all, in my relationship with my Higher Power, whom I choose to call God.

"Today I'm at one week AF. I hit several rock bottoms during the past week. Boyfriend almost left me last week after blowing my final chance (ultimatum if you will) but decided to give me ONE last chance. 

We did separate for a few days so he could have space. I stayed with my parents who were surprisingly supportive and hid all the alcohol from me. When I told them my boyfriend and I might split, they immediately asked, ""Because of your drinking?"" So it's been a well-known problem everyone was aware of except ME. I've been in denial about the pain I've been causing. I also have a soon-to-be 3-year-old daughter to think about and set a good example for. 

Then on Sunday I ended up in the hospital with a severely inflamed gallbladder and gallstones. One stone was blocking the duct so I required emergency surgery. I was hospitalized for almost 2 days and due to the new covid surge, I wasn't able to get a room nor have any visitors. So I was stuck in the E.R. with no TV or company, which was like an unofficial in-patient rehab. Me being alone with my thoughts really helped me self-reflect. 

Thankfully the surgery went well and I'm currently recovering. I was granted 2 weeks off work. The doctors gave me fluids to detox, and I had a doctor sit and chat with me about my alcohol use and told me flat-out if I keep going the way I am, I will surely have liver failure and / or liver cancer by age 40 (I'm 27). That was an eye-opener for me. I have a loving partner and amazing daughter that I want to live for, be healthy for, set a good example...drinking is just not worth it. I find myself not even craving it, which is a good start. I've tried to quit before but was always on edge waiting for the next opportunity to drink. 

My boyfriend has been supportive and keeps telling me he's proud of how strong I'm being, but I can see the doubt and fear in his eyes. I know it'll take awhile to regain his trust and respect. But it'll be all so worth it. I feel this all happened for a reason. Me deciding to quit and then being hospitalized immediately after just sealed the deal. It's not just about our relationship anymore, but my health is also on the line. We only get one life and we all get the promise of death. Whether I die tomorrow or in 60 years, I want it to be due to something that was OUT of my control. In the meantime, I want to enjoy the ride and not waste it.

I honestly can't say I had a desire to drink in the moment, but I did. Perhaps it was just an unconscious wanting that I wasn't able to see, doesn't matter anymore though. I drank and wasted all the efforts spent. All for a glass of wine (which I typically hate and always have been known to hate it). Part of me wants to blame the excitement surrounding me, with others during the diablo beta release.

"Alcoholism is hereditary, I blame my father for passing the addiction gene to me. My sister is lucky, she intakes alcohol the same as my mother, little doses, &amp; then it makes them sick. Although for my father &amp; I, we can heavily drink without becoming sick and it barley looks as if we have been drinking. This is a toxic trait and it gets you in a place you‚Äôd rather not go. I started drinking when I was 16, it never truly became a deep seeded issue until I was almost 19. I drank almost everyday, by myself or with others. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily happy, i was sad in ways, going through life as we all do, and alcohol intensified that sadness. Many didn‚Äôt see I was actually suffering, because I was constantly intoxicated. I brought alcohol to work, I went to work drunk. I brought alcohol to school, I went to school drunk. I had water bottles of alcohol in my car for when i was somewhere and needed a drink. It took me a while to realize that I was addicted to alcohol. I could( honestly still can) drink so much I couldn‚Äôt feel it anymore. I came to the realization I had an addiction when I practically let it control my life and who I was. In ways, I was partly still the same girl but I made bad decisions that affected others around me and myself. I lacked attention from my ex boyfriend (this type of attention I have always been greedy with because I was neglected by my father) and alcohol made me turn to others for this attention. I had so much anxiety when I felt neglected, and I used that as an excuse to drink. I used everything as an excuse to drink. Hanging out with friends, having a hard day, being sad, being bored, celebrating an event, Any excuse you can think of I had it, and used it. It‚Äôs hard to explain how i became able to control my drinking. I already naturally have so much energy and positivity, I didn‚Äôt need alcohol to give me a boost. I still drink but I don‚Äôt need it to get through anything or everything. I have more self confidence, I‚Äôm not as needy, or sad. Drinking doesn‚Äôt make you cool, drinking is a depressant, and if you have the shitty gene like I do it can destroy yourself and the ones you love. I feel blessed that I have been able to overcome this, and anyone with addiction has the strength to.",alcoholicsanonymous

"TOWARD EMOTIONAL FREEDOM

Since defective relations with other human beings have nearly always been the immediate cause of our woes, including our alcoholism, no field of investigation could yield more satisfying and valuable rewards than this one.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 80

Willingness is a peculiar thing for me in that, over a period of time, it seems to come, first with awareness, but then with a feeling of discomfort, making me want to take some action.  As I reflected on taking the Eighth Step, my willingness to make amends to others came as a desire for forgiveness, of others and myself.  I felt forgiveness toward others after I became aware of my part in the difficulties of relationships.  I wanted to feel the peace and serenity described in the Promises.  From working the first seven Steps, I became aware of whom I had harmed and that I had been my own worst enemy.  In order to restore my relationships with my fellow human beings, I knew I would have to change.  I wanted to learn to live in harmony with myself and others so that I could also live in emotional freedom.  The beginning of the end to my isolation - from my fellows and from God - came when I wrote my Eighth Step list.

"Hi everyone!! My name is Steve and I'm an alcoholic. I will start this off by saying I am 684 days alcohol free now. I never thought I could not drink this long.  But in my ""hay day"" of drinking, I would drive drunk frequently. Ok frequently isn't correct. I drive drunk damn near every night. I would hit the bars closer them out then drive home. My thought process every time was that I didn't want to leave my truck at the bar, my parents, who I lived with at the time would get pissed. Anyway, I did this well over 200 times. I don't have an exact number of course. But I am lucky because I ended up getting a DUI without causing an accident.  It was a wake up call for me to stop drinking and driving. About 10 years after my DUI, I began to drink and drive again, I had fallen into a pretty deep depression (still working on tbh) I tried to kill myself 3 times, all while being completely hammered.  I spent 28 days in an inpatient rehab/mental health facility.  It was the best decision of my entire life. 

I have spent the last two years working my butt off to get better. And here is the thing: it does get better. I started off going to AA multiple times a week. It was such a big help for me.  I feel more confident, I have no hang overs, I have better conversations, and I just feel better. It's not easy but you can do it. I believe that everyone is a beautiful human being and is worth being around on this planet. The journey is exciting. It's the best part of life. It's what life is all about. The journey. 

I have learned how to truly live life to the fullest.  Without alcohol in my life I have been able to change careers, nice to a new city, I got a dog, and I bought my first home. Those are things I don't think I would've been able to accomplish while drinking. I am grateful for getting to where I am today. I am grateful to be alive and kicking so that I can share my experience with you today.  You can do it. One day at a time. You are worth it. I promise.",alcoholicsanonymous

Lately my character flaws have been coming out. I talked to my sponsor and he mentioned how that‚Äôs the ‚Äúism‚Äù part of ‚ÄúAlcoholism‚Äù.

I work 3rd shift and last night I went into work late due to oversleeping. If I would have just went back home after seeing my oldest son I probably wouldn‚Äôt have overslept and been late for work.

"After all the turmoil with my nephew whom we currently care for it occurred to me that I never truly meditated on the fact that I could have become his guardian sooner if I had not been addicted to alcohol. If I had not spend the better part of 2 years dealing with my sobriety in selfish abandon. Yesterday he asked me why I did not drink champagne at his first school day ceremony. I told him in age appropriate words that I am not able to drink without becoming a horrible person. And that I am gladly not drinking anymore.  I went to bed feeling like I never made amends to him, I consulted my journal and asked my sponsor. My sponsor is a wise person but not exactly an expert with children. He advised I already make amends each day being the very best guardian I can be. But he does not know if that is sufficient So he told me to ask for advise here. How can making amends look like in this case? Nephew is 5 1/2 years old but as per his teacher quite mature for his age.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Hello,

Thank you for reading. I am 14 months sober and have been working with my sponsor for \~12 months. I trust her but have a resentment that I'm really trying to let go of towards her. It began when she made a ""group text chat"" for her and her sponsees (including myself). One of the sponsees ""left the chat"" weeks later, and my sponsor texted me (individually) saying how hurt she was by this and some other things. It really took me aback and I felt uncomfortable. At the time, I was very insecure and didn't know how to respond with good boundaries. I think now if that happened, I may react differently. 

Anyways, the group chat continues and I really don't care for the random photos and statements. They're not always connected to sobriety or recovery. The group text was originally just to share a zoom ID and password. I am trying to be willing to take direction and suggestion from her. But I find myself becoming angry or resentful. I feel a bit stuck and don't know how to be honest with her. 

Thank you for your time and responses. I appreciate it!!",alcoholicsanonymous

She didn't give me any instructions for step 4. I don't want to blame her but I'm so upset she didn't keep me working/busy... like I KNOW THE STEPS ARE THE SOLUTION and that I NEED THE GRACE OF GOD.

I really feel the LACK OF MOVING forward is dragging me down. I feel so stuck... no! I feel like I'm in quicksand... sinking fast.

"Hi everyone~ I‚Äôd like your advice and suggestions about dealing with a group member who openly and regularly defies meeting rules and protocols.  This man has 20+ years of sobriety and hasn‚Äôt had a sponsor since his last one passed away several years ago.  He shares every day and lectures all of us about what it was like for him 20 years ago and what we should do to stay sober. He is loud, swears, says the same things day after day, and regularly tells us that he doesn‚Äôt come to meetings to recover, he comes to help others. He comes late, leaves shortly after sharing, and ignores our meeting protocol of turning off his phone.  Invariably his phone rings or dings during every meeting.  He makes himself the center of attention and then once he has said his bit, he doesn‚Äôt extend respect to others by staying until the end.  Several long term members have found other meetings to attend so they can avoid him.

Everyone with a desire to stop drinking is welcome and I know I have the option of changing meetings if I don‚Äôt like it.  This guys personality is having such a negative impact on the group that I am hopeful for advice on how to address this appropriately with the group.  How do I handle this in a group conscience discussion?  How have you all handled this in the past?  Do I just keep quiet, pray for him, and ride it out?

"I have had a past of drug use and alcohol use.  I came into AA a year ago and worked the steps, with a therapist and have really made some great changes.  I am working with a company that is sealing my felonies so an employer can't see them.  After 5 years of being free you can get most taken off in Illinois.  Because of Covid slowing the courts, gods time, etc. that hasn't happened yet.  STILL, I have decided to throw darts at the dart board of good jobs and I landed the first one I found.  I am six months, minimum, from getting this off my record says my lawyer.  But now I have a background check that just got sent to me.  I'm going to have to explain myself one way or another.  I'm thinking of sending this email out to them now, before they screen me. Just to warn them that I have a background.  BUT, I am not sure.  I am also not sure of how much they will see since many services pop up different kinds of things on their backgrounds.  Now that I am writing this I can see I am trying to change and control this But it's truly because I found a great job using my real estate background to help homeless people get apartments, And it's from home.   Just the best possible scenario.

Should I wait and see what they say or just tell them upfront before they see it the background check?",alcoholicsanonymous
"An interesting way to look at recovery is through the eyes of our finances. When I came into the program, I was not only broke, but I was also seriously in debt, with no hope of ever finding a way out of the deep hole I‚Äôd dug. I‚Äôd become accustomed to spending every penny I earned or stole on drugs and alcohol, then using whatever was left over for food and shelter. I used whatever credit cards a bank was foolish enough to give me to further fund my dysfunctional lifestyle. I begged, borrowed or stole whatever was necessary to maintain enough of a buzz that I didn‚Äôt have to feel the pain in my life. My finances were but one of the heavy rocks holding me in slavery to my addictions ‚Äì when added to my selfishness, shame, guilt, arrogance, anger, denial, lying, stealing, hiding, resentment, and bitterness, I was convinced I was doomed to die miserably, and most of my days were spent simply waiting for that to happen. There was no way I could ever get sober, let alone dig my way out of the numerous deep holes I‚Äôd dug.

But AA promised a solution, and a way out of my hopelessness and despair. One step at a time, the weight of despair began to lift and darkness slowly turned to light; one day at a time, as I made small bits of progress, hopelessness slowly turned into hopefulness. I was learning how to move from emotional and spiritual bankruptcy to the first hints of recovery solvency. And, as I continued, I began banking small amounts of recovery experience which grew over time into capital I could use to invest in others. By making daily investments in my recovery, my reserves grew and I had more freedom to move about my life without fear, growing daily in confidence but without the arrogance I carried when I was using.

AA gave me, for the first time in my life, a sense of faith that all my messes could be cleaned up - my ruined relationships could be restored, my abysmal finances could be recovered, and my bitterness and hatred could be healed. Yes, it took time, and yes, it was hard, but the program worked and I got my life back. Today, my finances are healthy and expertly managed ‚Äì I‚Äôm free from debt and have significant reserves from which to draw when I have an opportunity to serve. I‚Äôm not talking about money (although that‚Äôs also in excellent working order), I‚Äôm talking about my spiritual, emotional, relational and physical finances and, despite having many days of sobriety, it‚Äôs this blessing of recovery that I cherish and into which I continue to make deposits. Like my bank accounts, when I stop making deposits, the accounts stop growing and it doesn‚Äôt take long for them to become overdrawn. Every day is another opportunity to invest in my recovery and keep my accounts filled. Without our Fellowship and program of recovery, none of this would have been possible for me.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Why can't I stop drinking. From February to March I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, and I spent another 5 days in the hospital earlier this month. Acute panceatitis and multiple flareups, stomach pains, low liver levels/enzymes, extremely dizzy when I wasn't drunk, my left limbs frequently go tingly/numb. The ER doesn't take me seriously because of how many times I've been there, they probably think I'm just drug seeking. The doctor told me a couple weeks ago I would have been dead if I continued drinking for another week. But here I am, still drinking. I'm only 21 and was told I could have been a week away from death. No matter what I do I can't stop. I'm thousands of dollars deep in credit card debt because of buying so much alcohol. I haven't told anybody how bad it really is, I don't want people to worry or care or think I'm leeching for attention, but I'm going to die soon if I don't change.

"Is anyone else experiencing this?  I started drinking every night since like March 2020. I would get drunk all day during remote work and basically trained myself to become a functional alcohol. About 2 years prior, I was addicted to cocaine for 3 years. I had a 2 year sober period and then the alcohol came with the pandemic and uncertainty of where the world was going. Even when I eventually returned to work, I was a trained alcoholic. Up until recently, I had been getting smashed at least 3 nights of the week. Sometimes more. Now I've quit cold turkey. Mostly because my organs have been hurting all the time. Kidneys, heart, liver. I don't even know how I'm doing now.  The positive is that I have no interest in drinking or smoking weed. Weed usually led to drinking. But this anxiety is out of control. All the paranoia I used to experience while binging cocaine is in full force while I'm now sober. I wake up not able to feel my chest and arms. I cant sleep. I can't eat. I'm constantly trying to catch my breath. I think everyone is out to get me. I truck rolls by and I'm terrified. My mind never stops. My gf thinks I'm back on drugs. I just want to feel normal again.

"I‚Äôm not really sure how to use reddit very well, I‚Äôve never been huge with social media so I apologize if I‚Äôm not up to date on everything this platform has to offer. However, I figured this would be the place to go for some insight. I‚Äôm 30 days sober and struggling. I‚Äôm a 21 year old male, and I‚Äôve been a heavy daily drinker since I was 18 years old. This is the longest I‚Äôve remained absent from alcohol in the last 4 years. My daily intake ranged from 2-10 drinks (usually at night) up until I turned 21.

 I‚Äôm in a particularly toxic &amp; codependent relationship which has caused me a great deal of stress, injuries, and run-ins with the local police. It‚Äôs been going on for about a year and a half on and off. We live together and don‚Äôt have the financial means to separate. About 8 months ago I had discovered infidelities in my relationship. Alongside coming to terms that my partner is a pathological liar who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. But if you asked me, I‚Äôd tell you she was misdiagnosed and is a clinical sociopath. 

I tried to use alcohol to make my situation more tolerable, perhaps to induce a mental blindness to the reality in which I was living. It got out of control pretty quickly. My mental health tanked, in result I quit my job. Anxiety was the main issue, making work seem unbearable. At my worst I was consuming about 3/4 of a 1.75 of 40% abv liquor daily. This continued for several months before withdrawal seemed to be constant no matter how much I drank. My anxiety was also out of control, I spent most of my time panicking and crying. Getting to sleep was the worst part of everyday. The anxiety was always worse at night. 

We had gotten suddenly evicted from our apartment, and were homeless for about a week before finding a new place. We were living in an Airbnb. The situation was a great deal of stress on top of having to manage my addiction. I was confident we were screwed. I suppose we got lucky. Once we moved into the new place I made the decision to go through my withdrawal in hope to find clarity &amp; mental stability in sobriety. I did taper, and it did it very carefully. I would consume exactly a shot of my liquor of choice every 4 hours. I did this for about 2 days before going cold turkey. The withdrawal wasn‚Äôt too extreme. Shakes, stomach pains, nausea, mild visual impairment (tracers), and of course insomnia were the main symptoms. This lasted about 3 days.

After getting through the rough part, the ‚Äúpink cloud‚Äù phase began. I felt great, I was so proud of what I had accomplished. I was finally living again, functioning beyond what I had imagined. It lasted roughly a week. Then the hard part hit me. Having to deal with all of the things I had been avoiding in my head, mostly regarding my relationship and living situation. I‚Äôm finding it harder and harder to communicate and express love to my partner, as I hold a lot of resentment against her. Depression and a feeling of emptiness has consumed me. Although, I do have to state that my anxiety has significantly decreased post cessation.

I apologize for the lengthy post. Hoping some of you out there can give me some pointers on what I can do moving forward.",alcoholicsanonymous

"Alright, I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I was making a fear inventory, thinking of everything that I‚Äôm afraid of. It‚Äôs a ton and understand I have some stuff to work on with myself. Specifically, letting go and letting god (as I understand him). 

One thing I came across was plastic hangers. I, as well as siblings, were ‚Äúspanked‚Äù up to or over 20 swats each per session. Varied based on moms anger that day. Going up the lower back all the way to the ankles. I involuntarily recoil when I see them. 

Clearly, I‚Äôm holding onto resentment to work through. But beyond physical abuse, it turned mental/emotional after running away to a friends house ‚Äúmaking a scene‚Äù. I realized today, I don‚Äôt love my mom. I‚Äôm remorseful to my ex-wife, my current gf, my siblings, their spouses, my dad, so I know I‚Äôm future forecasting for step 9. I don‚Äôt know if it is wise to apologize to an abuser. 

I called my mom to try to work through this. All I wanted was for her to own up to abuse. Not spanking as condoned by her Bible. But the abuse and terror she put me through as an authority figure brings back bad memories. My intent wasn‚Äôt to force a confession, but to just bring to light the fear and suppressed emotion. It obviously didn‚Äôt go as hoped, though I‚Äôm not surprised. She has also compulsively lied and told my sibs that I told her to not contact my gf as to insinuate I am manipulative and isolating my gf. I never said this and in fact was the one to give my gf a family members phone number so she could have support. This isn‚Äôt the first time she has pathologically been dishonest. 

I‚Äôve been sober 25 days. Don‚Äôt have plans to go back to my old ways. Read the big book cover to cover. Meetings everyday. Sponsor. But am looking for some advice from some other victims of abuse. I will clean my side of the street, not looking to change minds of someone who is beyond reason. 

I WANT to let go. I dont want to dwell, but don‚Äôt want to suppress either. But as I see it, letting go means keeping a family member at arms length. Rationally, I‚Äôm fine with this. Emotionally, I‚Äôm saddened by the loss of relationship, but would rather surround myself with positive people who want to grow. I‚Äôve received texts and letters from this person and interactions range from neutral to negative to downright enraging. ‚ÄúLet go, or be dragged‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhere is the credit for all the things I did right?‚Äù. ‚ÄúI used a hanger because they broke before things got out of hand‚Äù. ‚ÄúYour siblings had it worse‚Äù. ‚ÄúDad wouldn‚Äôt let harm come to you‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt know until you have kids‚Äù. A million ways to say what happened was okay.

I get it. She fed and clothed me. I want to show gratitude where it‚Äôs due. But I recognize the Muenshester-like relationship that wasn‚Äôt healthy then or now; for either of us. She‚Äôs bored without kids to control and has seemed to take pleasure in my (and brothers heart health) shit storm before I got on the right path with AA.

The fucked up part is I recognize the same irritability, discontent, and restlessness in both of us. However, I chose the bottle. Not to hit kids and gaslight them then and now (now adult). I want to make it clear that I CHOSE to drink. It helped me escape emotions, work-related stress, and shortcomings/defects of my character. I recognize how selfish I was (and am). But I‚Äôve been lying and hiding for so long, I just want to live honestly. I feel set free by admitting to myself and others that I‚Äôm an alcoholic. 

Thanks for reading this if you did and am open/willing to suggestion.",alcoholicsanonymous

"They send you to US for a reason.

This ridiculous tripe about ""don't make any major decisions for a year"" is bullshit.

Divorcing King Alcohol was a major decision.

EVERY Step is a major decision.

The Big Book makes clear that we need live life on God's terms. How do I live life on God's terms if I'm HIDING from His terms? Getting married (or divorced) are major decisions. Am I suppose to leave my bride at the altar because I decided to get sober today? Or put off divorcing a cheating, abusive spouse because I'm not drunk enough to make the decision? Getting a job is a major decision. Am I supposed to leech off the family, friends, neighbors, and communities I've been abusing for decades, JUST so i don't make a major decision for the next year? Shit, what if I'm female and pregnant? Having a baby is a major decision, keeping it or giving it up for adoption is a major decision, having an abortion is a major decision... I'd be FUCKED, unless I commit suicide to avoid making the decision...and THAT'S a major decision.

DAMN.

The literature implores me to be fearless and thorough from the very start. It tells me God can and will if he's sought. It doesn't say ""don't get a God for a year because that's a major decision!""

And then this shit about ""just don't drink and go to meetings cos meeting makers ‚úåÔ∏è make it ‚úåÔ∏è.""

‚ÄúWe are unable, at certain times, to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago. We are without defense against the first drink.‚Äù BB,Page 24 

If I could ""just not drink,"" what the hell do I need A.A. for?

Go to meetings? Where does the big book suggest ""running to meetings and regurgitating my feelings because we're all qualified to offer group therapy in here?"" 90 in 90? are you FUCKING kidding me? Unless you're making that 90 in 90 strictly speaker meetings, what's the point? You don't have anything to offer in terms of recovery, and, as pg 164 states, you can't transmit what you don't have, therefore, what good is it doing ANYBODY for a room full of non-program-working newcomers to sit around and share their misinformation and confusion with one another? And no, the Fellowship is NOT the program. ""Here are the STEPS we took which are suggested as a program of recovery."" 

""meeting makers make it?"" make what, gingerbread cookies? I've seen people go to a meeting, go to the bar next  door immediately after, get in a car, and die drunk the very same night. WORK...THE...STEPS.

Rehab is KILLING us. Statistically, A.A.s were recovering successfully at a rate of almost 80% prior to the advent of modern rehabs. Since? Less than 5% of new members from 1995 onward have five years.

"Today is marks 6 months sober which is something that I never thought I‚Äôd say. 6 months ago I figured alcohol would inevitably kill me after several failed attempts at sobriety. Instead I‚Äôm sitting here thinking about the 180 degree turn that my life has made for the better.. I‚Äôve lost 46 much needed pounds, went back to school and finished my degree and 3 weeks ago I started the career that I always wanted and alcohol would never let me achieve.

"So, for the last few years, as my drinking has progressed, I‚Äôm getting to the point where I am being kicked out of bars and/or being told that I‚Äôm doing/saying things that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúme.‚Äù  

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. The last issue was when I was at a bar that I frequented. There was 6 of us having a good time from what I remember. The next day, I went in after work for some drinks, and I was barred. They said I made some girl cry. 

That‚Äôs not me. I fucking hate seeing women cry, and I sure as hell would never do something that would make a woman cry. 

Another time before that, I apparently started a fight with someone. I can throw down; but I don‚Äôt like to fight. Not at all. I never start fights. EVER. 

I don‚Äôt remember any of these moments at all.

"Last night as I was trying to fall asleep, anxiety hit. I kept thinking about how much of a loser I am, the misdeeds I've done and the general shit that makes you toss and turn all night. Though, instead of tossing and turning and hating myself during that anxiety ridden time, I forced myself to analyze those feelings. I made myself rethink those thoughts, desect then to figure out why they were bothering me and by doing so, I was able to identify some defects and remorse. After finally figuring all that out, I was able to pray and cast those defects to god.

So what started as an anxiety fueled tossing and turning night ended up being a break though in personal inventory and a great night sleep.

"Hello all!!  I'm on day 22 of my sobriety. I'm feeling good for the most part - I've been hitting up 2 meetings a day when I can.  Getting some great support and meeting some great people. Have not got a sponsor yet but I am planning to do that when I find someone I connect with.

One thing Im noticing is that I seem to be building up a lot of anger and resentment towards people in my life.  I'm not sure what to make of this and I'm sure it's nothing new it's just that in my drinking days I'd get hammered and bury those emotions and now they remain and it seems to be building up. For example at work one of my colleagues is selling more than me in the last few weeks and each time I watch his totals get higher than mine it makes me angry. I guess that's my ego. We don't even get paid commission so this literally has no impact on my job but because I'm not the best I want to get back at him. It sounds crazy. Another example is my wife's sister asked her to attend an event on the weekend so I have to change my plans this weekend instead of going to the cabin I have to stay home to look after my kid and I found myself scheming to get back at her sister for ruining my weekend. 

These are really petty things in the grand scheme of things but in my current state it just seems to be building up. I tried reciting the lord's prayer and serenity prayer but it doesn't seem to be helping. I have not really mastered step 2 and 3 - I am 100% accepting that I am an alcoholic and my life is unmanageable. I am having a problem accepting that God will help me because I've always only had myself never been a man of faith!!

She told me she would be willing to sponsor me and that we would do a call the next day. I did not hear from her for a week after that.

On Monday she texted and apologized by saying she was busy and that time went by so fast (I get it). I did not respond to her immediately but when I did, she said we can do a call today at 7pm. I have not heard from her. 

I do not know if I should call her or if I should text her or wait for her to call me. I am feeling really frustrated - I have terrible social anxiety so asking her was hard enough, then she took a long time to reply and that messed with my BPD and I started to feel really rejected.

Only through positive action can I remove the remains of guilt and shame brought on by alcohol.  Throughout my misadventures when I drank, my friends would say, 'Why are you doing this?  You're only hurting yourself.'  Little did I know how true were those words.  Although I harmed others, some of my behavior caused grave wounds to my soul.  Step Eight provides me with a way of forgiving myself.  I alleviate much of the hidden damage when I make my list of those I have hurt.

She said she would like to meet regularly, which is cool for me as I'm only alcoholic in recovery I know irl. 

 I gave her a copy of Big Book, and some pamphlets that got sent to us by general service last year, and we agreed we would meet next week again.

"Summer 2021/august: 

Hello my name is jun I‚Äôm schizophrenic I‚Äôm writing this from my own bed at home I feel sad writing about this I barely can find proper affection from anything honestly.  

I‚Äôm 21 years old born in January 2000 7th, perhaps the way I‚Äôm writing this isn‚Äôt really perfect and I‚Äôve started drinking kind of heavily since 4 days ago. 

I do have a therapist that I spoke about this case around yesterday I guess. I don‚Äôt really have much to talk about all I do is go to gym play video games get drunk and idk I cannot cry I just feel like alcohol is holding me from crying. 

I just wish I can physically sleep with someone (not sexually) since my sleep pattern is really messed up I usually sleep at 9pm wake up around 1~6am. 

I lost my previous future that I really wished for, it‚Äôs kind of hard to explain. I don‚Äôt feel depressed yet I feel lonely even tho I know I isolate my self intentionally although it‚Äôs not a bad thing. 


Childhood wise I was abused in terms of getting blamed or fighting with my own sisters or being beaten up physically by my own brothers. 

I am really scared typing this while drunk cause I feel like garbage and I am kind of sad. 


I don‚Äôt know what to say I‚Äôm just typing this out of sheer sadness I hope something would change that I know posting this won‚Äôt really change anything and again I really don‚Äôt wanna resolve to alcohol as my escape house thus this is the reason why I joined the threat or group whatever this is called ‚Ä¶ early cause I wanna push away the negative outcome of alcohol and I really wanna be happy with out relying on a substance that makes my stomach feels funny.

"Hi!
So background story: I‚Äôve drifted away from aa for the last 5 months. Kinda went down a rabbit hole of wondering if I needed complete abstinence or not. I figured alcohol wasn‚Äôt that important anyways, so there was no need to test it out. 
I told myself im not out of aa. I can go back whenever I want, and that I really did want to someday mainly so I could sponsor other women since others tell me that‚Äôs where the magic is. 
Anyways
I drank this beer with the guy I‚Äôm dating at his apartment. It was the last beer in his fridge, so I couldn‚Äôt have drank even if I wanted to continue. Im not upset with myself for drinking. I don‚Äôt believe my life is in shams now because I had one beer.

I do know that the separation I‚Äôve had from alcohol has been very eye-opening for me, which is why I‚Äôm turned off by the idea of drinking at all. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll affect my relationship with god by me not continuing my spiritual practices. It‚Äôs hard to show up for yourself and others when alcohol is involved. 

Anyways. So I‚Äôm not depressed. I‚Äôm actually feeling pretty great mentally and spiritually. I have moments where I‚Äôm not fond of aa, like the last few months. But ultimately, I‚Äôm grateful for the program. So how would I get involved again? I don‚Äôt want others to look down on me cause I had one beer lol. I just know that it doesn‚Äôt align with what I want. 

Idk. 
Has anyone ever had one or a couple of drinks and then came back to aa even though nothing disastrous happened?",alcoholicsanonymous

"26 F. I just got home from a doctors appointment. I have a lot of chronic health problems, one of them being fatty liver. My ultrasound showed mild a year ago when I had it. Blood work was elevated about a year ago but has been consistently normal. I get liver pain, especially after drinking. I‚Äôve never had a fibroscan even though I pushed and pushed. I also know you can have damage even with normal ALT AST.

So here I was at my appointment, listening to myself talk as my anxiety has spiraled out of control. I also have severe health anxiety. I was honest that I don‚Äôt drink nightly but when I do, it‚Äôs 3-5 drinks. Sometimes it is nightly a few days in a row. When I asked for reassurance regarding my liver, she said ‚ÄúYou need to abstain or your liver won‚Äôt be okay.‚Äù This was my wake up call. I don‚Äôt know why but it felt so powerful to hear it from my doctor. 

So here I go, on my journey to sobriety. I‚Äôve had so many day 1‚Äôs and that can‚Äôt happen anymore. I don‚Äôt know if I feel ready but I have to be. This is for me. While it feels like this is a negative, like a HUGE loss that I‚Äôm grieving‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm realizing I need to look at this as a positive, as a win, as freedom. 

As I head into my journey I do not want to do AA but I am wondering if there is a support person that can help me. Like a sponsor but just a support person that I could call or text on hard days.

"I turn 24 soon and a lot has changed. This may be a long post, thank you for reading and helping.

Last Saturday was an all time low for me. I was hospitalized for attempted suicide while visiting my girlfriend. 

I started drink in 8th grade. At the time it would be some Smirnoff ices every 2 months. While I began taking shot in Highschool, the frequency of drinking never really increased. I tried to limit my alcohol consumption because alcoholism runs in my family, three family members currently fall victim to it. 

I went to college and began drinking more often. My freshman year wasn‚Äôt bad, although there would be spurts of blacking out and getting wasted. After joining a fraternity my second semester I noticed I drank significantly more, but so did everyone else hung out with. 

My sophomore year I met my girlfriend. She is above my league and I would be nervous around her, this would result in me drinking before I hung out with her - luckily we would go to parties together so it wouldn‚Äôt be suspicious or weird. As we started dating, I became comfortable around her. 

My junior year was pretty much my first incident. It was HER 21st birthday and I blacked out at her pregame, even though I couldn‚Äôt go to the bars. Normally blacking out wasn‚Äôt that much of an issue, but I was a mess there. Her friends were no happy and she was concerned. A few months later I turned 21 and had a pregame. I tried to not black out in fear of repairing the same events, but my fraternity brother literally shoved alcohol down my mouth. That night we had probably our first big fight. I was saying nonsense, called my ex to prove a point, and puked all over her bathroom. 

Senior year she moved back to DC, she was a year older. To not feel lonely, I decided to live in the fraternity house. Things then began to worsen again. It was fun and games drinking but I had more incidents. Shortly before my birthday I blacked out at th bars and cheated on my gf and got a lap dance from a Stripper. I even got her snapchap to have sex with her that night, luckily I fell asleep after ubering home. More arguments with my gf ensued, she even told me that she began having feeling for another guy.

I decided to go to grad school since COVID took away a lot of jobs. That is when I really noticed that this relationship with alcohol began deteriorating. I would be a dumbass and start fights when drinking with my friends. I also would try to start fights at random people at the bars, on the streets, and even a nurse once who shared an Uber with me. I even cheated on my gf again but getting another lap dance, this time on my birthday but at the same strip club.

I noticed that I would become an aggressive drunk now. This leads us to last week. I went to dc to visit my gf for 10 days. I arrived Friday and we made plans to go out with her family/friends to get bottomless mimosas. At this time I haven‚Äôt had alcohol in a while - this is mostly because I started antidepressants and was scared to drink on it. The days before going to DC I increased my prescription. The day we drank was my second day on this increase [300 xl bupropion]. I noticed that I got tipsy quickly, but wanted to pace myself. I began posting non-pc content on social media while drinking - I noticed I did this to spark arguments with people. 

We went home and I was ready to stop‚Ä¶ I wanted to stop. When I start drinking I find it very hard to stop. I was also iced my my gf‚Äôs brother 4 different times, one of them being a big bottle. 

I was being a disrespectful dumbass infront if my gf, her brother, and young uncle. I began telling her secrets and we had an argument. I stormed off and began walking to her place. I grabbed my suitcase, told her parents that I think it is over between us, and began walking to the airport (2:30 hours away). On the way to the airport I went to the liquor store and bought a fifth of whiskey. 

I began crying and walking. I called my gf that it is over. I layed down on a patch of grass and told some more of my antidepressants. She called again and I told her what I did. I called my family and told them that I love them and said goodbye. My girlfriend told my mom the situation - my mom attempted suicide when I was young. 

My girlfriend found me walking the streets with my suitcase in one hand and a bottle in the other. She grabbed the bottle and threw it on the ground. The cops arrived later and took me to the hospital for attempted suicide.

I went to the worst hospital in DC, verified by the internet. They took my belongings, phone, rosary, and shoes. They put me in a chair and locked me in a room with other mentally unstable people. I was there for 18 hours. They ran out of water. Took 40 minutes to bring me ibuprofen after puking. They wouldn‚Äôt let me call my gf - I had to tel them I was calling my sister.

Now I am home. I don‚Äôt feel good. I wanted to have a good time drinking with my gf and her family. I am still dating my gf, but she isn‚Äôt too hopeful about things right now and I don‚Äôt blame her. 

Even now, I still crave a nice six pack of coors. Even after all of this, I would struggle turning down a drink.

I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place I want to set an example for my sister to stop emotionally enabling him and I'd like him to apologize to me before I see him but I know that, won't happen so I'm not sure if I'm going to see him or not.

I've been sober almost three and a half years and it's not good for my sobriety to be around people like him even though he is my father. If I thought that an intervention would help I would organize it but he's not ready to stop he's made that very clear.

If that person, and the wrong done to him, keeps coming to mind, time and again, causing an uneasy or perhaps guilty feeling, then I put that person's name at the top of my 'amends list,' and become willing to make a sincere apology, knowing I will feel calm and relaxed about that person once this very important part of my recovery is accomplished.

Many women do not like a Non Drinker and I want your help on how to make a first date great even when she is the only one drinking ? Any tips on that and also if you have ever been into that situation how did it go ?,alcoholicsanonymous
"I recently did the worst thing that I have ever done to my partner while blackout drunk and don‚Äôt remember it. They were avoiding dealing with it and now they are sick and sad and traumatized. I NEVER ever would have done that if I wasn‚Äôt drinking, I can‚Äôt take it back, I can‚Äôt even remember. I don‚Äôt want to lose my partner and I know that‚Äôs not my choice. I‚Äôm sick and I feel like a monster. How do I help them? How do I stomach myself? Does it get better? Can someone help me?",alcoholicsanonymous
I can‚Äôt keep going on like this I don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore,alcoholicsanonymous
"I've been doing this for about a week, found a sponsor and everything and went through the first step and immediately after my last meeting I went out and bought a fifth. I feel awful about it but honestly I don't know what else to do. I feel like this whole thing is just worsening my denial and stressing me out. I don't think people respect me at all. I sense a lot of bitterness. Oh well. I think I've got a few good more years of drinking in me before things fall apart. Fuck it.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Today is my first night sober and I‚Äôm having a real tough time getting to sleep, any advice?",alcoholicsanonymous
Drinking will eventually lead to death. I know that. But it seems the lesser of two evils. I'm on my last ditch treatment for depression. Even ECT (shock therapy) hasn't proven to be a long term solution. I cope with planning for possibilities. So what do you do at that point?,alcoholicsanonymous
"So since I started drinking at the age of 20, I always felt like I wasn't that bad compared to my drinking friends. here I am at 30, making enough money to drink every night on my own and play video games. sounds great yeah, but I'm being swallowed and idk if i have the strength to stop this whirlpool of shit because i cant find happiness or entertainment anywhere else.",alcoholicsanonymous
I've finally decided to quit drinking. I'll be celebrating my 32nd Birthday in 4 days and I'm looking forward to it being a sober one in over 15 years. I'm looking for support from anyone will to offer. I'm tired of the toll alcohol has taken on my life and I just wish to feel normal again. I've ruined countless friendships and destroyed numerous relationships because of the monster I become when I drink. I truly wish for all of that to end. I really just want my life back and I'm really looking out for any support that anyone is willing to offer.,alcoholicsanonymous
"Sorry if not allowed- I read the rules and this is not against the preamble.

I am 34 f with almost 2 years clean and sober (sobriety date 9/1/19) been working AA since June 2020.

Female preferred but not necessary.

Please message if interested.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Today I celebrate 1 month free from alcohol. I have a lot of work to do but my life was so dark and headed towards death just a month ago, I literally just wanted to die. I never thought i could stop, each day is still a struggle but with the help of my sober friends in AA i get through it. So grateful.",alcoholicsanonymous
"After 48 days of sobriety bliss, I fell off the wagon and had a few drinks. No I didn‚Äôt go on a bender, no I didn‚Äôt get drunk (very slightly buzzed) but I did realize how much better my body and soul felt without it. I want to make this post for anyone who is struggling with their sobriety and thinking about drinking‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not worth it. It wasn‚Äôt refreshing, it wasn‚Äôt fun, it sucked. Now I‚Äôm starting from scratch all because of a 30 minute buzz.",alcoholicsanonymous
"Iv had a toxic relationship with alcohol and drugs for a minute. Quarantine made it worst ( like 2 bottles of wine a night and day drinking all day bad ). So I went to therapy and Iv gained really good skills at cutting down alcohol. Right now I have 1-2 a night but I struggle being completely sober a couple times a week at night  for a couple reasons. 

1: I can‚Äôt sleep with out alcohol and I know the only way to fix this is to power through it but I literally went 48 hours with no sleep the last time I tried so I‚Äôm extremely paranoid and scared to try again. Benadryl knocks me out the fallowing day and I‚Äôm trying a new vitamin my therapist recommended but I don‚Äôt have high hopes. 

2: I get extremely bored at night while watching tv or on my phone and like to have something to do with my hands and mouth. Iv tried fidget tools or food but it‚Äôs not the same. 

3: I struggle with my mental space in general and I like how alcohol makes me focus less on those issues. 

I‚Äôm young (23) and didn‚Äôt start drinking till I was 18 and it only got heavy around 21. I can‚Äôt smoke weed because my job drug tests and I don‚Äôt take any other types of drugs anymore (I use to take E and stuff at raves but not consistently). My family has a history of alcohol abuse as well. I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm sounding like I‚Äôll have serious issues the older I get. I worry about my heart and liver, I take a bunch of vitamins and I try to walk daily but I know the best thing that would help would to stop drinking so much. But I also know people my age and older that drink way more then I do and aren‚Äôt worried about their bodies or if they have an issue.",alcoholicsanonymous
"I seriously think I have a problem- even though I have a bf, anytime I drink, I text and call my ex‚Äôs or guys I had a fling with. What is wrong with me? I genuinely get so ashamed looking back at my phone the next morning but the problem is, I don‚Äôt know the conversation I had with the guys. I end up deleting our text convo during midnight because I know I‚Äôll cringe the next day. I seriously will end up burning bridges with people and have people judge me for sure if I continue this. I know this is a problem and now my only solution is to stop drinking.

Edit: Question. If I contacted people randomly while I was drunk, should I apologize to them? Or say anything? Or act like it didn‚Äôt happen? Sigh",alcoholicsanonymous
"I‚Äôve been to two AA meetings now, and I‚Äôve been sober for 4 days. I have a lot of social anxiety, even relating to good friends, of which I have many (I‚Äôm an ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù, ‚Äúfun‚Äù drunk). In the month preceding my sobriety, I isolated myself a lot because I was sad and felt very lost. Now that I have a few days of sobriety under my belt and I‚Äôm trying to pick up some pieces of my life (work stuff, car stuff, debt stuff), I‚Äôm feeling extremely overwhelmed. There‚Äôs so much to DO. I know it‚Äôs going to be hard for a while, and I just need to handle things day by day. I just don‚Äôt really want to see any people right now, besides my boyfriend (hanging with him is low-stakes. I can do my own thing, I can be quiet.).

I don‚Äôt want to talk about my decision to stop drinking with anyone, I don‚Äôt feel like laughing and being silly (being ‚Äúon‚Äù), and I don‚Äôt really feel like being around folks who are drinking even moderately. A *big* thing I want to be about it is not flaking on people, and I generally want to nurture my relationships. But for the time being, I don‚Äôt feel like I have the emotional fortitude. 

Is it okay to isolate for a while in early sobriety, and explain later? Or is that alcoholic behavior (hiding from a problem, that kind of thing)?

Thanks!",alcoholicsanonymous
"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn‚Äôt know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.
