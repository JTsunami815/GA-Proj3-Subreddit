"I'm now at 100 days. I can't believe it honestly. It was super difficult but I'm glad I did it. Honestly at this point the cravings aren't troublesome, however still existent.  I think I won't be returning to this habit. 

At one point due to my addiction, consuming nicotine became my personality. I was constantly inhaling this garbage. Literally every couple of minutes I needed to take a hit. My health started to deteriorate, blood levels weren't normal and doctors started to get concerned. I still didn't give a fuck. I was very stubborn. One day however, breathing just became impossible. I'm now on two inhalers as a result. It scares me straight. 

Trust me when I say this, it's possible to quit. It's not impossible. Don't be like me and have to deal with a health consequence (hopefully temporary) to motivate you to quit. Let my health problems motivate you to do better.

If you're considering quitting, I believe in you! If I can do it, so can you.",stopsmoking

"I've been a heavy smoker for a quite sometime smoking around 2 packs a day I quit few times the longest being around 2.5 months, around a month and half ago I decided I want to take better care of myself and my health and work on my running (my biggest dream is to become an elite runner and that doesn't really go well with smoking.)

I've been doing great, Ive felt like I've been happy for the first time in so long and I was feeling like I can breath on my runs for the first time ever, but this weekend I went on a vacation with some co-workers and I got so drunk and smoked so much.

I told myself that I'm in control and I won't let this be my relapse, I made it for a couple of days but today I smoked two cigarettes.

I feel crushed and I'm losing meaning of life, I don't want to go back to the smoking life and I also don't want to live my life moping for a cigarette, I really don't know what to do I feel like I hate myself and my life. I'm stuck in a loop that I don't know how to get out.

Maybe it's worth mentioning that I live with two roommates that both smokes and the smell is so triggering I can't begin to describe it. 

How did you break the loop? does it ever get better?

I feel like I'm a hopeless case and I don't want to live like this anymore, I really need some advice on how to not relapse again.",stopsmoking

"I'm currently an active smoker (1 pack every 3ish days) and juuler (1 pod a day minimum). I recently ordered the book to stop smoking and that should arrive soon but I was wondering how separate are both of these addictions? I usually am just inhaling something constantly it just depends on if I'm outside or inside. I know people that have switched from one to the other and completely lose interest in the former after switching but for me I just use both. Assuming I'm successful in quitting one, would I have to then attempt to quit the other? Would I lose interest all together? I impulsively threw away my juul and pods after ordering the book and am just sticking to cigarettes until the book arrives. I'm not sure how any of this will go but the differences between these addictions is a bit confusing to me. Any input would be appreciated",stopsmoking

"I think it's best for me to take care of this problem as early as possible. I usually go to some kind of party once or twice a week, and when I drink I always feel the need to smoke. As of recently it has been turning into having a cigarette after work, or in the lunch break, and currently I am smoking upwards of five cigarettes a day. One during my lunch break, two on the way home from work, and one going back and forth from work. There are days where I don't smoke at all, and I've tried cutting down on my smoking. I usually manage to go 14 days until I start thinking ""Nahh, smoking isn't really such a big deal"". And then return to bad habits.

I guess my main issue is not being able to see a long term stop.

"I managed to quit cold turkey, but I'm having a really stressing couple of weeks because my mother is moving to my city and I'll have to take care of her. She is not a nice person and all this is making me me really depressed. 
Yesterday I came back from my therapist and ended (after a really tough session) smoking all the afternoon. Continued this morning. I'm sad and angry and I don't know if I'm feeling this because I did quit smoking 3 days ago or if I went back to smoke because I feel like this.
I realize that going back to chain smoking won't solve anything. In fact, it will make everything worse because now in addition I feel disappointed with me.  I now have two problems. My depression and the cigars.
I've read here that it's not unusual to feel blue once you stop smoking. How do you avoid going back to the cigar when you feel like this? I was so proud of myself for archiving a day off smoke. Now I'm once again in square one.

"So last week at work, my office had a caramel apple dip bar and later on I bit into a really hard spot that caused a filling to pop out. I immediately called my dentist and scheduled a filling replacement for yesterday. From Thursday to Sunday, I just felt sensitivity here and there but was fine otherwise. Just nursed my open filling until I came in. Then Monday morning I started feeling intense tooth and jaw pain. I called my dentist worried about it getting really bad and infected so they prescribed me antibiotics. 

My tooth and jaw was hurting REALLY bad and then yesterday when I finally got to the dentist, they took x-rays and found an even bigger problem. Turns out I had an abscess tooth in my front bottom left tooth but the pain was felt in my jaw and other teeth. Fortunately they don't have to extract it and just did a root canal, which relieved the pain as they drained all the pus. I asked my dentist if this happened from bad oral hygiene even though I brush twice a day and floss along with using mouth rinse. 

He said there was nothing I could have done and it's out of my control. But I'm thinking all those years of smoking, even though I quit last year, and occasional vaping might have been a contributing factor, even if they weren't a sole factor. I mean I never told my dentist that I smoked or vaped as I hid it from my family. And here's the thing. Even though it's been over a year since I quit, I would still buy vapes here and there or ask my friend for a few puffs. While vaping may not be as dangerous as cigarettes, it's still not good for you. I didn't vape all the time but the times I'd buy them, it'd be those cheap disposable vapes ranging from $8-20. Most of them have been pulled from the gas stations that sell them, probably for the best.

"Hey everyone, I haven't smoked in a couple weeks now and mostly got through the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by now. But for halloween weekend I was out with some friends who do smoke partying and I found it very hard to not smoke at all. The main thing was just the habit of having something to hold and the atmosphere rather than wanting nicotine itself, so I was thinking getting a vape pen with just nicotine-free liquid to replace cigarettes for those situations would help a lot to make sure I never start again.

My main question is, will those also fuck up my lungs, give me a cough, make my voice sound like shit, etc? Are there health issues with vapes even if they have no active ingredients? If it's pretty harmless I think it would benefit me a lot to pick one up so I don't get tempted to bum cigarettes but if it will cause a lot of the same negative symptoms I'd probably be better off just trying to get by with willpower.",stopsmoking

Idk if it was actually a craving. It was just a thought about how I wouldn't be bored if I could still go outside. Is that considered a craving? Normally, I would feel them in my body.... if that makes sense.

Starting again to smoke is not a bad thing at all. In contrast, I think it is a gift.

Ask yourself why you smoked, under which circumstances, which pattern of thoughts lead you there, what did you lose by starting to smoke again (maybe confidence? what else?) and so on.

I failed in my first attempt because someone forgot his pack in class, our teacher asked us, if it belongs to someone. Nobody answered and i said, that i can take it, if its unclaimed, than i took it :)

Second attempt failed, because i went to a Cafe with my smoker friend.  I was able to control myself. I didnt want any cigs. Anyways, my friend went to WC and left his burning cig on the ashtray. I looked at it, it was charming. I thought, that i can handle 1 puff, its as easy as pie. I took a smoke... After half an hour i lit a cigarette :(

Now, i haven't smoke cigs for 5 days and now i can feel, that i can get rid of it forever! Today i didnt felt the 'craving' first time in 3 years. I didnt believed myself to get rid of it but right now im sure that i can handle it, without any 'puffs'.",stopsmoking

"Hello!! 27(m) here, two packs a day smoker for 13 years. 

Today I will stop smoking again. 
I've been trying several times over the last two years and I always go a few days without and relapse back to smoking. 
Keep feeling bad about myself and with a strong depression and anxiety . 

Thats terrible! 

I would like to stop it for good!
I'm feeling really frustrated by the amount of failures, the time and effort I've been putting into being able to stop this damn addiction for the past two years. 

Im honestly believing that I will make it this time.
I have thrown away my packs of cigarettes about five times in the last month, but always go back to smoking. 
My monkey brain believes it can bring me benefits, such as relief from anxiety and depression. 

I rather deal with these feelings now. 

This drug war against myself seems to have been a huge waste of time in my life.
I'm having a relationship with alcohol that is slowly killing me aswell. 
Alcohol only makes me sick,  I hate being hangover and having no energy for anything at all the next day. Right now I'm drinking at least three times a week, blacking out every time.
Whiskey is my favorite drink. Need to cut it off aswell. 

Recently I've got prescribed for a medication, that will help with anxiety (trintellix).
That was my first time visiting a psychiatrist and I hope it works for me... 
I need this brain fix. 

If I dont stop now this will become more difficult over time and with more serious consequences for my health.
My mind and body are giving me THE SIGNAL to stop smoking.
Need to deal with this disease that sneaks up and makes me smoke and drink just to feel bad about myself and repeat the cycle of self-destruction. 

How do I stop this madness ? 

Denying the urge to smoke is necessary.
Letting the body detach from the substance and deal with withdrawal crises in the first few days, exercising, drinking plenty of water, good quality sleeping, eating healthy, meditation, breathing exercises.

That's a good place to start...

Please, feel free to add more things to my list of new habits!

Wish me luck.

I know I have the strength to leave this way of life now.

Thanks for reading this. : ) ( :",stopsmoking

"I‚Äôm starting a new job on a very rural hiking track, I thought the change of scenery might be a good time to go cold turkey or will the withdrawals jeopardise my ability to do my job? I know in the past when trying to quit I‚Äôve gotten very very moody but maybe the excitement will cancel it out? What do you guys think",stopsmoking

"TLDR: I hate I started smoking. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôll be posting daily for accountability purposes. Here‚Äôs for Day One. Remember to breathe. 

I‚Äôve been here, time and time again. I know the risks of smoking. I know the addiction. I‚Äôve smoked for quite some time. But I‚Äôm nervous. Here‚Äôs my story.

When I was 18, I moved in with my SO. I was still in high school, but I needed to escape my family. Constant threats from a homophobic step-father, always reminded I‚Äôm about to be kicked out and to not come home. I couldn‚Äôt take it. I left the day after my 18th birthday. My life continued to be challenging, but in new ways. But I thought I was in love. Then, my SO passed away. It tore me apart. How could I not know he was addicted to drugs? Was I that naive? I move back home and surrounded myself by those who actually loved me.

My mother was one of those people. She is a chain smoker. I picked up on the habit. What was I thinking? I hate that I did it. Now, 13 years later, I smoke way too much. I need this to end. My energy is low, my breathing is terrible, my happiness is out of reach. I quit previously for a year and a half. I know I can do it. But I‚Äôm still scared.

So my last cigarette was yesterday at 4:00 pm. I‚Äôm doing mostly well. I haven‚Äôt smoked. I‚Äôve stayed busy. But I know the next couple of days will be tough. I can do it.

Thank you for listening. I needed to get some of this out. I‚Äôm committing to posting daily. I need accountability.

If anyone needs to work with someone to get this kicked to the curb, please feel free to reach out.

"I have quit smoking since 4 month and Im still suffering from horrible symptoms ( no motivation, mild depression, bad concentration, mild fatigue...). I think this is because smoking causes P. A.W. S like most drugs and It could takes 2 years to fully recover from it. Even doing the basic things became a struggle after quitting smoking especially studying. Is this a common thing? Or maybe Im a special case here?",stopsmoking
Had 3 months then i smoked a cig. On purpose. I thought about it for like half an hour then smoked. Since then I've been having a cig here and a cig there and can feel it creeping back to what it used to be. I'm having a really hard time remembering the bad because right now it's so easy since I'm only at a cig every few days. Trying to stop before it gets bad again but gah it's hard,stopsmoking

However in the last 2 days I have completely changed, I am constantly on edge and I just want to smoke sooooo bad, it‚Äôs almost as if my body is in pain lol (I know this might sound ridiculous but I need to tell someone). Has anyone else experienced this, does it get better? 

I know I won‚Äôt smoke, by the way. No matter how hard it gets I won‚Äôt smoke again. But it‚Äôs just incredibly uncomfortable and I want to help myself through it, if I can.

"Currently in my longest attempt to quit and feel pretty good. I‚Äôve been doing it because I realized I don‚Äôt necessarily hate the habit of smoking and all of the awful side effects, I hated the feeling that I was being deprived of something when I wanted one. 

At a movie theater? Fuck. When am I gonna get to smoke next? Should I miss the movie and speed smoke or deprive myself of a cigarette?

It got to the point I would preemptively smoke a cigarette before going into somewhere I knew I couldn‚Äôt for a while,  then still look forward to the next one and miss out on all the fun stuff. That feeling alone just sucks donkey dick. 

In the end I think that feeling is what is keeping me going. I‚Äôm going strong despite being a bit anxious and mean, but I‚Äôm trying!",stopsmoking

"I'm so chuffed. Last Sunday I decided it was too much hassle to go for a smoke - we were on holiday in a rented cottage and it felt a little wrong to nip outside whilst on the owners property with no-where to discard by fag end. So it just kind of happened. To my surprise, it has been very easy and none of the things I thought would happen when stopping have happened - no hacking my lungs up or being irritable with people.

"After a year and a half of no nicotine I caved and have been smoking a bit the past week.

"First, answer the question - can you get off the couch right now and run a marathon?

For most, the answer is no.

Because if you are not a professional, then your body is simply not ready for a marathon.

In order to do this, you must train for several months. Run farther and farther every day. Increase the load gradually.

Smoking is the same. Nicotine is embedded in our biochemistry as a neurotransmitter and the body is simply not ready to give it up.

We must gradually train our body to do without nicotine. Train him.

To do this, gradually, over several months, reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke per day. To do this, increase the interval between smoke breaks every day.

If you have problems with keeping track of the time, use special timer applications. I recommend SWay, or use the search term ""quit smoking gradually"".",stopsmoking

"30 years... It actually sounds wild when I really think about it.

Started off as so many of us do with joints/spliff etc and even though I stopped smoking weed about 10 years ago I have never managed to kick the tobacco. 

I stopped when I went to bed last night, timed it so that I'd have nothing left in the house when I woke up and resisted going to buy more today. Although I am on a nicotine spray to control any cravings. 

I've calculated that I would have had about 5 cigarettes so far today and I used to smoke 50g of tobacco in about 5 days.

I'm keeping my hands busy doing a run through of Dark Souls 3 and as long as I can keep focused on the game then I'm hoping that will distract me from thinking about tobacco.

TLDR: I don't smoke or vape, my friend offered to let me take a hit and never let me vape again. I want to know if the urges would be manageable if I only do it once and never do it again. 


My friend group is comprised of smokers and stoners but I don't touch the stuff. Yesterday my vaping friend has asked me if I want to try vape. He has been very clear that I can try it, and if I don't like it, he won't let me touch it again. He's aware that vaping is bad but he's too pessimistic to bother trying to quit himself. I've been considering it, and I figure that I should stop calling vaping nasty until I've done it myself. 


I doubt I'll like it, and I have complete faith that he would keep nicotine away from me if I got addicted or looked like I was going to. But I also have ADHD which means I have a higher chance of developing dependencies and addictions. 


So, if I do it once, will I go through a bad withdrawal? How bad would it be, and would I be able to go the rest of my life without vaping again? 


Thank you all in advance",stopsmoking

"Hello everyone! 

I am a dental hygienist, and I am doing some research into the use of nicotine gum as a form of nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking. I just wanted to get some first-hand information from people who actually used nicotine gum as a means to quit smoking. 

I have many patients who I see who smoke, and I want to be able to give them the best information possible that comes from real people... not just information written on the internet by companies trying to sell a product. 

I want to know;

1. Did nicotine gum help you quit?
2. How long did you use nicotine gum for? Example: how many months or years did you use it for? 
3. Did you use any other products/methods to quit? Example: vaping, hypnosis

Thank you SO much for your answers in advance. I really appreciate it. I never want to scold or make people feel bad for using tobacco or nicotine products, all I want to do is give people information that may help them if they ask me questions. :)

"- Giving up‚Äô - there is no sacrifice. Brainwashed. Only positive things. 
ESCAPING an addiction. 

- Are non smokers being deprived of something by not smoking? 

- You only smoke for the relief of withdrawal pangs which you created by continuing to smoke. There is no actual relief or boost. It fools you into thinking the opposite. 

- May be tempting to have just one more cigarette but it will start you off again and cost you ¬£40.000 over the course of your life. 

- Every cigarette you light, you are closer to the bomb exploding. How do you know if it‚Äôs the next one?

- You won‚Äôt feel insecure about smoking. Think of when you walk with a cig and people are behind you

- You‚Äôll have more energy!

- You‚Äôll have more concentration 

- You will be able to respect yourself 

- You won‚Äôt be paranoid that you smell of stale smoke 

- Your breath will smell better and your teeth will become whiter 

- Your skin will improve 

- We assume we enjoy them only because we cannot believe we‚Äôd be so stupid to smoke if we didn‚Äôt enjoy them. 

- The enjoyment isn‚Äôt from the cigarette itself, it‚Äôs from ending the agitation caused by the craving 

- Cigarettes are enjoyable only after a period of abstinence 

- Smoking is a drug addiction 

- Cigarettes create the symptoms they relieve 

- On bad days remember smoking is not going to cure it. You‚Äôll just feel shit for having started the chain again. 

- Cigarettes create the void. They don‚Äôt fill it. 

- Pangs are a craving for poison. It is the beast dying. 

-!You will still think about it but that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Just rejoice that you‚Äôre a non smoker and that you‚Äôre not giving anything up. 

- You‚Äôve absolutely made the correct decision

"I started reading Alan Carr towards the end of last year, without any real intention to quit. By the time I got to the end, on the 2nd Jan, that was it, I was done, I threw away my tobacco and gave up, totally motivated. The year before I had quit a daily weed habit. 44 yo now, smoking tobacco daily since I was 16 ish, weed socially which also increased to a daily habit by the time I was in my early twenties (ironically, it was an ex girlfriend 'making' me give up tobacco, we lasted a day (less?), then naively thought smoking a spliff (with tobacco) was ok. stupid. three days later I got back on the tobacco with a newly found daily weed habit.)

fast forward 20 odd years and I hadn't gone an hour without smoking either, ok with some control over the weed, but pretty much. Something inspired me to give up weed in 2019, which was crazy difficult, but I managed, and at least had tobacco as a crutch to get me through. Quite a thing after being a little bit high (but mad productive tbf) for 20+ years. 

Anyway, after going a straight 6 months without weed, after 'mastering' the addiction of it, it would then be smoked very rarely, mostly socially, or with a drink at home, and was quite a creative, enjoyable thing, and that to me was fine, I kinda wanted to be able to enjoy it recreationally without being addicted to it. 

Then giving up tobacco (in rollie form) this year, arguably made a lot easier with lockdown, as socialising was minimal / non existent. Sometimes if I had a drink by myself, I would smoke a bit of pure weed, but never tobacco, and I was fine with that, I would return to totally non-smoking me the day after, so felt like I had it under control. Then at a friend's birthday a few months in, a friend shared a spliff with me, weed and tobacco, and wouldn't you know, it was the freaking sweetest thing ever, but nonetheless, I still maintained it as a social thing, kind of a one off, and didn't again for ages after. As lockdowns were lifted, and socialising more, so to would the smokes, sometimes with tobacco, but would only ever happen every few weeks, sometimes even less often and I was quite happy I could have a bit of fun, smoke some weed and tobacco, and return to non-smoking me for weeks after. This was the dream. 

However, eventually just smoking when I was out, turned to 'oh I'm a bit hungover, I'll have a smoke this morning', so once a week became the weekend, became 4 days and so on, and stupidly my rule was no rollies, only if there was a bit of weed involved, (because then i wasn't motivated by the tobacco).  One weekend I was working at a festival, a creative and quite a solitary experience, and out of nowhere I started smoking actual cigarettes ( i haven't smoked / liked actual cigarettes in freaking decades, just tobacco smoking, but had some old cigs with me to mix with the weed as I reasoned at least I wasn't carrying tobacco with me and would be less tempted to smoke tobacco by itself), but even after then I returned to most of the week not smoking.

I've totally lost it over the last couple of months, all kinds of excuses to smoke, and stupidest of all, 'well I'll just smoke a rollie, as I don't want to get high' &lt;facepalm&gt;. I saw it was a totally out of control,  daily thing again, gave up for three weeks, but then caved again, and have been smoking every day again for the last couple of weeks.

I've been away from home, (family holiday etc, 'ah a hotel room to myself, might as well smoke every day here!') but am about to return home tomorrow and hoping as that's where I successfully gave up, with all the new routines and habits I've developed to help me stay off it, I can again, though conversely, that can also be my place of zero restraint, which it has also been. 

Insomnia has been a big factor too, as nicotine and weed has gotten back into my system, it's been worse than ever, sleeping absolutely zero hours whenever I've had an early start, sometimes now for no reason at all (erm, hello! nicotin/weed withdrawal!??) and it was this happening at the beginning of the holiday that made me think eff it, smoke, better to 'enjoy' it and be able to sleep then be miserable on an expensive holiday I can't afford because of crazy insomnia. I am looking into hypno therapy and melatonin dosages for the insomnia. 

What worries me is that I don't seem to  have that motivation and drive I've previously had and been able to return to. Even when I did smoke, I knew I was going to return to non smoking me. but now.. 

I was SO proud of myself for giving up tobacco this year, as were my family. I really hope I can return to it, but equally now I can see I am hoping to return to not smoking 90% of the time, and just socially, but I've proof now of where this invariably leads.

Sorry, an immensely uninteresting post. But good to vent, and wondering if anyone has any thoughts or advice. thanks xgu77x",stopsmoking

Last night I woke up in an absolute panic, sweating and scared, convinced that I had relapsed, and smoked. It felt so real. The fear that I had thrown away my last chance, the guilt and shame of not being strong enough to resist. Our addiction has its hooks so deep in me, after forty five years of abuse, I know I will never be completely free. Last night doubled my resolve to never give in.

"I picked up this shit habit back when I was 16, healthy, motivated, socially thriving with a good idea how I wanted my life to plan out. 

Fast forward 10 years, I am now about to hit 26, and I've been in slow decline ever since. Underweight, hair thinning, and the worst of all stomach problems. Appetite gone to shit and upset stomach whenever I light one up. The stomach would get so bad that it made me develop social anxiety due to the fact that I'm constantly uncomfortable, yet I can't seem to be able to beat this fucking addiction. 

I've tried to turn my life around and pursue better health back in June, having quit caffeine. Probably sent my body in utter shock, anxiety, depression and I still feel like I haven't entirely recovered from it. It feels like a state of anhedonia and whenever I feel like I kicked the psychological caffeine withdrawal symptoms, I get hit with another wave of bad mood, to a point that I don't feel ready to battle nicotine. 

For the past two months I've tried to quit cold turkey, I can't seem to make it past day five. Brain fog, irritability, confusion, intrusive thoughts, I feel like it won't get better and I light up to alleviate the symptoms. 

All I need right now is some sort of reassurance. I really want to be free from this shit drug, I really want the energy back to be able to hit the gym and get back the confidence and self esteem that should've never left me to begin with. There is so much potential being kept from us, getting buried deeper with every stick we light up.

I apologize for the rant, I hope each and every one of you succeeds. Although this fucking parassite has been with us for years, it's no longer worth it. I've failed so many times up to this point, I just can't stand not being myself during the withdrawals, it's scary not being able to function properly and not knowing when you'll feel sharp again. This is actually the first time I've seriously considered kicking back all the bad habits. It gets tough when you realize that it's actually way more difficult when you're left head to head with your demons, but if you're going through hell, be it nicotine or any other addiction, please don't stop.",stopsmoking

"I had cut down drastically since July this year.   First, I stopped buying cigarettes and started rolling smaller my own tiny cigarettes with a small filter.  That helped with the barrier of having to roll your own vs just grabbing one from the pack at any given moment.  Then I started rolling hemp spliffs (tobacco with hemp) which helped a lot with nausea and anxiety from nicotine withdrawal.  The most difficult thing was the depression and low energy/brain fog I was feeling which I took ginseng and St. John's wort for.  

Next, what happened was I got a dry herb vaporizer which I smoked mostly the hemp and barely any tobacco at all.  A dry herb vaporizer heats the tobacco at \~300C as opposed to combusting the tobacco at  900C degrees + , you get the nicotine but none the carbon monoxide and noxious smoke.   I was going to stop smoking altogether and just continue to vape.  But one day I accidently left the vape at someone's house and so I was craving nicotine.   I still had some rolling paper and loose tobacco and I so  I decided to roll my tobacco again, and then I also had this juul (an e-cigarette).. I was smoking normally as I would for about a few days, until couple of nights ago I definitely overdid it and smoked way too much nicotine than normally I would have vaped in one day and it also gave me really bad insomnia.  Ironically too much nicotine plus the lack of sleep made me feel like my heart was racing.  I had to take some blood pressure medication to feel alright.  Now when I look at the tobacco, it just makes me feel like it might take my heart out.  I really hope I do not pick up another cigarette again... 

It hasn't been a straight path of quitting/cutting down but I am on Day 2 of no nicotine now.  I feel like I'm getting a head cold and I'm very sleepy.   I am drinking a lot of chicken soup with ginger, ginseng (powder), turmeric and garlic... and lots of decaf chai/roobois tea--- its helping a little bit with the congestion.

"This is my fifth day without any tobacco. Overall, I‚Äôve been greatly reduced for the past year. I used to smoke about 4 cigarettes a day on a work day, probably more like 6-8 on weekends. This total divided between actual cigarettes from a pack, and daily spliffs (weed and loose tobacco mixed together). 

When the pandemic started, I cut out the cigarettes, but kept the spliffs. I tried switching to joints but it just didn‚Äôt hit the same (obviously‚Ä¶cause I was addicted to nicotine lol). When I started being able to see friends again, the cigarettes came back into my life, socially only. But I still smoked about 1/2-1 spliff each day on my own. It was how I winded down from work. 

A few weeks ago, my boss got Covid. I work in his home and was exposed. Weirdly, I also got an extremely intense respiratory illness, but I took two PCR Covid tests a few days apart within the recommended time frame, and both came back negative. It was the first time I had been sick in a long time. I coughed so hard that I threw up a few times, and burst the blood vessels in my eyes. 

Ever since then, my anxiety has been through the roof. Every time I cough, I think I‚Äôm gonna throw up. It has happened a couple times, though mostly I can cope it away (it‚Äôs coming from a mental place). I basically convinced myself I have lung cancer. And every night, my brain had a battle with itself. The addict part saying ‚ÄúYou need to smoke. You have to. It‚Äôs what we do. You can‚Äôt skip it.‚Äù While the anxious part was saying ‚ÄúPlease PLEASE don‚Äôt smoke tonight. You‚Äôre gonna make us throw up. You‚Äôre giving yourself cancer. Please I‚Äôm begging you to stop.‚Äù And it‚Äôs crazy how strong addiction is. It can overpower even the part of the brain that is literally trying to preserve your own current safety. I kept smoking these last few weeks, and would cough and feel sick, and the cycle was just fucking ridiculous. 

But five days ago, something finally clicked. All of a sudden, the part of my brain that doesn‚Äôt want to feel nauseous every day from coughing finally defeated the addict voice. I got home and looked at my spliff rolling stuff, and just thought to myself ‚ÄúGod dammit, enough is ENOUGH!!! You don‚Äôt even enjoy this anymore, stop fucking doing it!!!‚Äù And admittedly, it‚Äôs not like I did some amazing healthy thing that night. I just laid on my bed and watched YouTube and tiktoks mostly. But as I did that I was like ‚Äúwow, this doesn‚Äôt even feel that different than when you smoke.‚Äù Because my tolerance is so low from a decade of daily spliffs, you know? 

And I got through an entire workweek smoking nothing. No spliff, no cigarette, not even a joint or something. And each day, my anxiety lessened. I no longer felt like breathing was causing me to need to throw up. 

I finally fucking did it. 

I have a lot more I could say about my relationship with food and how smoking weed plays into that, but suffice it to say: while I struggled pretty bad with that early in the week, I‚Äôve improved greatly and have been eating closer to a normal amount in the evenings. The daily calorie count is still far too low, but it‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôve got plenty of extra weight on me to get me through, lol. And I‚Äôm taking vitamins. All this is so much better than the zone-out binges I was having after smoking every night. 

I have energy, I can breathe, I worked out three times this week and didn‚Äôt feel sick after. I just turned 30 and while I‚Äôm a bit disappointed in myself for letting this plague my 20s, I think I‚Äôm still early enough in my life that like‚Ä¶this is pretty good. It all feels very hopeful right now.",stopsmoking

"As the title states, I quit smoking through a mixture of Allan Carr and why quit. And it's disconcerting that a year and a half later I still want a smoke nearly every day at least 4-5 times a day and I dream about smoking every other night.

"This might sound like common sense, but before I quit smoking. I used to say that I liked the social aspect of smoking and how it'd go hand in hand with drinking. Sure, those parts may have been enjoyable at the expense of the other times. 

Some of the things I don't miss about nicotine addiction is when I'd run out of smokes and then fighting the urge to buy a pack despite costing $14-17, only to cave in and do it. Or the other times I'd be at work and if I didn't have any of my own cigarettes, I'd go out of my way to offer someone a dollar for a cigarette, which I felt pathetic doing. 

Then there'd be times where I'd get irritable if I had to hide my smoking habit from parents, dates, and other people that would approve of it and look forward to them leaving so I can have a cigarette. I wouldn't vocalize it but internally I'd be craving really hard. 

When you don't smoke, you just don't think about these things and it's truly liberating. For example, when I get off work, I just look forward to going home and winding down and watching tv as opposed to ""needing"" a cigarette before I go home. I didn't use Allan Carr's book to quit but having read some parts after I quit only reaffirms my decision to quit. 

My biggest takeaway is to not envy smokers or miss it. When someone smokes, they are looking to bring themselves to a state that non-smokers are always at, and it couldn't be any more true. Not to mention that using nicotine, of any kind, only increases cravings not reduce them. It's foolish to think otherwise.",stopsmoking

"Hey y'all, first post here. Just posting because well.. I quit four days ago and I was supposed to start work two hours ago and have been struggling through the nicotine-related blocks. I'm just writing to get this off my chest and share with the community because there's nobody else in my life that understands. 

It's not right to call them cravings, I think. Its also not quite right to call it withdrawal. I've been smoking for ten years since I was 16. Before and after every class from Junior year of high school through college and work since. Mostly cigarettes in high school, then working with a hookah at my desk 8+ hours a day through college, to mostly 5% - 6% salt nic vapes for the past two, three years, which - had the advantage of being able to hit virtually non-stop during the day.

 Before I started using nicotine, I was using cannabis for another 2/3 years  before that and have since used it continuously as well. 

Between the two... I feel like my brain literally doesn't know how to function in ""everyday reality"" without them. Every few moments is spent trying to release this deep-seated panic like my brain has to be re-trained to deal with baseline reality when nicotine has been my entire coping mechanism. Not even for anything specific, but in contrast to any degree of self-regulation. 

I don't think I'm about to fail. I know this release and re-training is a path to a kind of liberation. But god damn. This is more than just putting something down. This is more than ""just"" an addictive habit. This is fucking full-scale cognitive restructuring in either direction, right down to our most basic physiological habits of breath and sympathetic nervous system activation. I feel like I need a whole-ass month-long retreat just to learn how to breath and function like a normal human being again. 

In the meantime.. I guess I'll do a shitty job on work and hope I get better with my breathwork in the near future. Best of luck and best of wishes to everybody struggling, processing, or even just thinking of quitting out there in the community. Love for all.",stopsmoking

"As the title says, I‚Äôve been smoking lightly over the past 2-3 weeks. Like less than a pack in that time, I‚Äôd smoke like once every two or three days. 

About a week ago I stopped, a few days later i started to feel kind of down, sort of like caffeine withdrawal, like a sort of really tired and moody kind of feeling.

The last couple days I‚Äôve just been in this constant state of intense panic.

Is there anything I can do to help? I've stopped yelling about it (years ago), I've stopped nagging him about it (about a year ago).

" Hello All, I have been smokers for past 6 years and I tried to quit cigarettes so many times and every time I do I fail and I wonder why? So 4 months back, I wanted to quit again and decided to log my whole journey so I used to log trigger and time when I smoke and over the the weeks data I see clear pattern and my mind was more aware of pattern and triggers, so after a week I decided I will try to distract myself with different techniques(dancing, drinking water, talking to friend, breathing exercise etc..), initially first week 80% of time my cravings were much powerful then my mind ... but I was keep doing and exercising the same practice and target one trigger at time( eg: I will not smoke after any meeting ) and overtime I realise that my mind is more and more aware of my habit that helps me to make my judgement to smoke or not on certain trigger... after couple week of practicing the same I was manage to smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day to 1-2 cigarette a day and now I smoke occasionally. And I thought what helps me can help others as well to control smoking, so I started building app for that cause, in first app version I am supporting below features

1. set daily smoking goal 
2. log every smoke with triggers 
3. analyse your trend - trigger wise, day wise and will provide you comparison based on past data

"A realization I've had is that quitting smoking is all about the mindset.

Let me clarify:

You can use Nic patches, or any other type of Nic replacement. You can switch to vaping, you can use gum. Etc... The point is, those are all substitutes. Even if you're just chewing a mint gum, that's a substitute: one habit for another. You're not kicking the habit, you're just satisfying it in a different way.

To draw an analogy, your kid really wants McDonalds. He's throwing a tantrum, wants a cheeseburger *RIGHT NOW*. You can't get him McDonalds. Instead, you make him a cheeseburger at home.

In that sense, you didn't kick his habit of wanting McDonalds. He'll still want McDonalds. You just patched it with something he doesn't want but will quiet him for a bit, until the next day when he throws another tantrum for McDonalds. And it will be an endless cycle. 

Similarly, you aren't kicking the habit when you substitute it for a piece of gum or seeds. On a good day, it will distract you. On a bad day, it will aggravate you more. At the end of the day, you're still living under the shadow of a cigarette. You're under the mercy of a cigarette, and how much you can control yourself for that single craving.

Multiple that by however many cigarettes you smoked in a day. 

---

What I'm getting at is, then you start tallying up. You start keeping count. *Okay today I fought off 15 urges. Tomorrow, I will have fought off 30 urges. A week from now, I'm a week smoke free.*

Your life **revolves** around the cigarette, your cravings, and your resistance. You took a habit that was a big deal to you, and made it into an even bigger deal after you tried to quit it. Hence, you're still a slave to it, even after you stopped it. 

---

On the other hand, you hear about and see people who were a pack a day or more smokers for 10, 20 years. And suddenly, they dropped it. No visible withdrawals, no keeping tally. You ask them when they stopped, they couldn't tell you the exact date. But They just know it was a while ago. Hell, some might even pick a cigarette once in a blue moon because they're out on a vacation at a bar or something. But they're no more of a smoker than anyone else, and they won't fall back into it.

Even smoker mothers, who get pregnant. They drop smoking in a heartbeat, and don't think twice about it. Again, because of priorities. 

This has nothing to do with ""addictive personality"" or any of that. It comes down to one thing:

their mindset shifted. They had other priorities come up. Maybe they just didn't want to smoke anymore. Maybe they suddenly had a baby. Maybe they met someone. Maybe they had a stroke. And in that sense, smoking was no longer a priority or even a thought. Smoking because so minuscule that they didn't even think about it. They didn't keep a tally, they didn't fight off an urge. They just moved on, because they had more important things.

---

And in that sense, quitting smoking is a mindset.",stopsmoking

I miss listening to music and smoking a cigarette, as a matter of fact a few days ago I was anxious and panicking and had a fear of depression and OCD returning ( I'm diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and have had depressive episodes before ) and all I was thinking about in that moment is to smoke but I didn't. I'm glad I didn't but sometimes I feel like I want to, I somehow miss it even though life is better now, no more anxiety over how many cigarettes I have left or other things, I have more time to do things I love and to talk to loved ones. 

I was a smoker for 2 years and by the end of it, I used to smoke around 20 cigarettes per day. Sometimes even 1 pack and a half or 2. I've may even got acid reflux or maybe GERD because of smoking since the last two months I've been having problems with acid returning to my throat.

I know that smoking is an addiction and that there's absolutely nothing about it that's worth going back but how can I remove that feeling of comfort that it gave me ( or maybe it truly didn't give me anything at all ) ? 

Thank you so much!",stopsmoking
"OK on day five but first full work day and, at about 10 a.m. when I'd usually have my second smoke of the day, I swear I could smell cigarettes even though there was no one smoking anywhere near my house (I work from home and live in the country).  I lit a candle to overcome the smell but it was still kind of there.  This seems very weird to me. Anyone else?",stopsmoking
"It's been 4 weeks since I quit smoking. 
I'm having massive issues after I quit cigarettes, Dizziness,Headaches, blood pressure up or down 
Brain fog, Now the recent issue after I eat I start feeling dizzy and light-headed. 
I don't have the need to start smoking again.
I'm just having a lot of issues I removed black tea, some tablets and started feeling ok, but few days ago after I eat I feel dizzy And pressure in the head a feeling I never had before. 
Has anyone gone thru the process of quitting and thru the side effects of quitting as what do I need to do is there any specific food or drinks I need to eat/drink to feel better. 
Thank you I appreciate any help I can get

" I‚Äôm an independent touring musician, and make my living playing shows most nights. I‚Äôve been a cigarette smoker for about a year and a half, a habitual weed smoker for around five years, and a fairly regular drinker for at least the last three years. I take prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, which I started during the pandemic when I was in a particularly low place. One of the guys I tour with quit cigs with me two weeks ago, and we‚Äôre going strong on the no-cigs front, but here‚Äôs where I could really use some advice: 

I‚Äôm struggling to find a healthy way to cope with the extra anxiety that comes from nicotine withdrawals - I keep leaning on other vices more to push past the urge to buy a pack of cigarettes. I‚Äôm smoking more weed, drinking more, and overeating every night. 

I play a lot of brewery/bar gigs so alcohol is always free and easily accessible and I‚Äôve already noticed myself drinking more at shows to take the edge off that I‚Äôd usually rely on nicotine to take care of. Yesterday, I opted not to drink during the show and I felt so restless when I got home - couldn‚Äôt sleep, walked for an hour, tried to get some work done - I ended up caving and getting stoned to calm down. I want to find balance and distance myself from all the shitty vices I‚Äôm leaning on. Do you have any suggestions for quitting nicotine without shifting the weight of your personal discomfort to other addictive things? Thank you! I joined this sub recently and have already found it to be super helpful. &lt;3",stopsmoking

"It's late, I'm depressed, full of nicotine and I desperately want to quit. 
I have horrible anxiety already and the additional anxiety around my health and the way I smell, am perceived etc. is too much to take. 
Tobacco is absurdly expensive in Australia and I'm wasting my money on something that is going to kill me   and is worsening my physical capabilities. 
I'm young and I don't want to keep putting it off because ""I've got time"". I don't want to be digging my own grave any more. 

I am done. I'm ready to get rid of this shit no matter what. I previously read Alan Carr's book and it was like an actual switch being flipped. I quit for a year until a particularly bad break up. I had that first puff and the work was all undone. I didn't even crave the nicotine, I just wanted something to fill the empty space. 

Does anyone have suggestions/tips for how to replace the one thing I think a cigarette gives me - a way to passively kill time? It doesn't require focus, my thoughts can still bounce around without taking away from the task at hand and there's a clear beginning and end, kind of a goal to  complete. It's satisfying when I'm by myself and anxious, not really able to collect my thoughts and it gives me something to lean on socially when I'm nervous (either to kind of stimulate myself or to act as a social buffer? I don't know how to explain it). 
Things like stress balls or fidgetty things don't work because they're aimless and also usually socially inappropriate. 

It would also be great to hear from anyone that's had success re reading the Easy Way to Quit. 

TLDR; what are some alternatives to filling empty space? Especially ways that will still work in a social situation where I can't just whip out my phone and start watching YouTube. Also, is it worth re reading the Easy Way to Quit?",stopsmoking

"So made it through my first month. I have noticed so many life benefits in such a short space of time it's crazy. People tell me my skin looks better, all my health anxiety around breathing has gone. I don't wheeze anymore, I don't cough regularly. There's no phlegm clearing routine in the morning. There isn't ash and tobacco and filters and baccy packets and rolling papers and discarded bits of cardboard everywhere. I can have my window closed at night without fear of sleeping in a smoke cloud. To all you out there just starting, it is so, so so worth it.

"Basically the title...

I find it very hard to quit cold turkey, I have been smoking for over 11 years and the last year or so I've smoked pretty heavy.

Cold turkey is not going to work for me, you can't convince me otherwise.

Not a fan of vapes as they cause health problems as well.

So the safest and easiest way seems to be NRT. I will break the hand to mouth habit while still receiving nicotine, I can be smoke free while still receiving nicotine, then of course slowly reduce nicotine (according to the instructions) until I'm ready to quit the nicotine.",stopsmoking

"(35F) smoker since age 12, with countless frustrated quit attempts and a handful that lasted a few months, never a full year. I haven't attempted to quit since before the pandemic.

Husband (39) also a lifelong smoker who has only attempted to quit once, was recently injured and has been hospitalized.  He is now two weeks quit and perhaps two weeks from coming home with physical limitations (i.e. won't be getting outside for smoke breaks) and will be out of work for perhaps a year (i.e. budget is going to get very tight).

He feels pretty okay on the non smoking aspect of things. Hes not in the best physical shape overall, but I can see a positive improvement in his skin and eyes which might be directly related to not smoking one to two packs daily for two weeks. I never thought he would quit, but this may be it for him. 

It would be amazing to remove cigarettes from our family and household all together while he heals and we focus on a new season with new challenges. 

So here goes. I have found this sub very helpful in the past, and hoping we have both already had the last cigarette of our lives.",stopsmoking

"Quitting vaping question

I smoked cigarettes for many years before changing to vaping, I have stuck to vaping for over and year or so and want to quit vaping completely, I used to have a ecig which I would refill but then I started smoking elf bars  20mg disposable vapes which have around 600puffs, vaping negatively effects my throat, teeth, gums &amp; breathing which are only some of the reasons why I want to quit.

"Im young and have been smoking for 3 or 4 years now. I primarily vape these days, but have alternated between that and cigarettes over the years. In the summer of 2019 I smoked around 4 packs a day, and today on average I vape four juul pods per day ( I dont use juul but thats the best way to quantify vape use imo ). 

Bottom line is that with recent federal legislation even vaping is astronomically expensive now. While I think its ridiculous we vilify vaping so much, I'm pretty much left with no choice but to quit. Partly because I dont want to allocate more per month to nicotine than I already spend, and partly because it pisses me off that congress can just control my life and what I consume.

My biggest hurdle is probably obvious to you by now, but I genuinely dont care about the negatives of smoking. I still love everything about it, even if I know that objectively I will benefit from not using it. 

Honestly what I'd like to hear is the positives yall have felt from quitting? Hopefully thatll re-frame my mind because past attempts to quit have all failed in under 24 hours for me. I think I fail to remember what it was like to not be tethered.

"I'm now 4 and a half days smoke free. I told myself if I could make it through 3 days I'd be okay; those first 72 hours were pretty tough and I was hit hard by nicotine cravings but I like a challenge. Plus once I'd started the daily streak of no smoking I didn't want to break it. 
The morning after my third day, I had a dream just before waking (side note; I've been sleeping so well, even since the first day, and feel really rested). I dreamt I woke up on a beach, took in a big breath of fresh air, and looked out at the water, which was shimmery pink and blue, it was sunrise. I got up and walked along the shoreline, I walked along a pier, and said how I really felt like going swimming. I started back along to the beach, and said how I love not smoking and how I love the mornings now. I felt joyful, saw a child playing, thought how beautiful everything was. (Weirdly my ex was there the whole time and I was talking to them, I've only had bad dreams about them before but they didn't disrupt the peace of it at all, they just followed me around, felt calm for them to be there). 

Then I woke up irl, and immediately got out of bed and went for a jog, without having to force myself at all, I really wanted to and had a bunch of energy. I did the same today.
It was a simple little dream but I guess having that sentiment come through in a dream is a nice feeling. I've quit quite a few times before but always ended up having 'just one'. Hopefully this will be the final time, and the fact I've quit drinking will likely help. I'd love to smoke forever but I feel better and enjoy no longer being a slave to any addictions.",stopsmoking

"Hi folks!  You might remember me.  I posted back when I initially quit.   

I quit in early August, not a single cig in over two months.   I am currently battling cancer and after discovering I am peeing blood again, when I shouldn't be, I got weak and bought a pack.  I smoked about half the pack, and I feel really ashamed of myself.

I am 60 with bladder cancer.  After having my tumors removed, my doctor scoped me again and noticed some ""pieces"" that he missed.  Now I am scheduled to have that same operation again.  First time I had complications and actually had to cath myself a few times.  The idea of doing that all again...  Anyway, at work yesterday I noticed I was peeing blood again, which should not be happening since I was ""healing so well"" according to the doc.  I went home early from work and started my leave early, since my operation is in a few days.

I don't consider myself ""starting back"".  Now that I have calmed down from my initial panic, I am like ""damn, what have I done? Did I REALLY just start again after going through all that to quit?"".  I am not gonna let this beat me.  I am NOT letting cancer have me, I will NOT let cigarettes' get me either.  

It is just hard and depressing.   Really don't have anyone to talk to about it either.  My co-workers are friend-like, but mostly just acquaintances.  All of my blood relatives have already died, my lifelong friends (only really only had two) are both dead....   My wife is a drunk and I ""think"" somewhere in there she cares, too busy being self absorbed to worry about me.  But, for her part, I understand, her Mom is suffering from dementia and she is her care giver.  She has toned down the drinking and is trying to take care of her, so I don't give her any crap.  Can't really talk to her, but not really upset wit her as she IS going through alot herself.

I plan on resuming my quest to beat cancer and stay off cigarettes.  I really don't know why I am posting this, just bored and lonely I suppose.  Not really seeking pity or anything, just felt like unloading a little.  I actually feel better writing this.  My cats like me though, and they never judge...  They just stare...  and wait...

I don't want to smoke, all the things I am doing kind of make me feel like I am out of self-control.

Just recently I am feeling a ... sadness. Just a crying type episode every now and then over nothing really. I‚Äôm having a bit of body pain. I remember in the first couple days after I dropped it down to only 5 that I had immense brain fog. I was forgetting everything. I had a sense of doom but that mostly went away. 

No that has seemed to pass by I have this sadness about me recently. It‚Äôs not nice and is a pretty strong feeling. 

I have a couple variables in my life that maybe could be responsible for this as well but I think it‚Äôs from cutting my intake of cigs in half. I‚Äôm also having some anxiety.

"Hello everyone, 

I've previously stated that I was going to post weekly for three months in my Past posts.

And then I stopped. The reasons I stopped were that I got insanely busy at work and didn't have a lot of time off, but mostly it's that I just don't even think about smoking anymore. To sit here and write these posts is something that would have to be scheduled these days or I just won't get around two doing it. It's wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

My Ferrari Fund is now over $1000, I will certainly be getting one at some point in the future thanks to cigarette money saved. Still a ridiculous concept to me that not smoking can pay for a supercar over 15 or so years. But on the other hand, last year had someone told me that, it probably wouldn't have mattered. When I was a smoker, the idea of being a non-smoker actually seemed way more unattainable than a supercar. I'd always be able to afford one of those some day, although I'd neevr buy one without a fund set up for it like this. But not smoking? That seemed like a fantasy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now though, I am a non-smoker. I don't think about it at all, I'm not tempted to have a smoke during all the natural cues I used to have (After food, first thing in the morning with coffee, commercial breaks, in the car, during intermissions.... I used to smoke constantly, all of these cues are really just excuses). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to promise to keep writing these because I probably won't, but I can't express my gratitude to this sub enough for recommending Allen Carr. I learned so much about my addiction and the lies/delusions it was telling me. Smoking consumed me and didn't let go for all of those years. It feels so good having my life and mind back from that awful, awful disease. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I can quit, and get to this point of not needing, or even wanting a cigarette, anyone can. And I'm serious, I wouldn't take a puff of a cigarette if paid $10000 right now. I don't want to be a smoker ever again.  It's just a matter of finding the right tools that work for you. I wish I'd have found Allen Carr sooner because that was instant to me. It really was easy to quit with those tools. I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it. Get the audiobook, grab your smokes, and listen to it all in one shot. Just set aside 5 hours of your day and you'll easily stop smoking. At least that's how it worked for me.

Thanks again everyone. You've got this!",stopsmoking
"I‚Äôve been trying to at least abstain from smokes for about a year now, maybe two. I have Hypertension and Generalized anxiety, so I definitely know factually that I need to stop.

I find it near impossible to attach my feelings to anything unless it‚Äôs in the moment, which greatly kills my ability to *want* to stop smoking.

"***It wasn't easy but I did it!***   


Quick background: got addicted when I was in 6th grade and smoked a pack a day for 10 years.   


 Anyhoo, I've decided that it was time to quit this year as I wanted to be able to see my future daughter grow and go to college and whatnot. So I started with a Juul which went well and I was able to kick it off completely after 3 days or so but after a while, I've realized that my nicotine addiction got more intense and I was consuming more nic than I was w normal cigs, so I switched to freebase juice (lower nic levels) with a pod mod device.  


After that point, I've decided to gradually decrease my nicotine intake until it's 0mg, and I was able to decrease it to 3mg in 2 weeks but then I realized the flavor had played a big role in why I vaped too much juice in a day, so I've ordered a special juice that had no flavor in it. It was a bit weird but I got used to it and reduced my daily vaping amount by half.  After that, I was convinced that I was pretty close to quitting completely very soon.   


In the meanwhile, my Doctor had put me on a new medication called ""Wellbutrin XL"" for my ADHD treatment. I've started taking it and after 3 days or so, it was a Thursday afternoon, I just had my lunch and I've noticed that it's been more than 6 hours since the last time I took a hit from my vape and was pretty amazed by the fact that I didn't even think about it during that time.   


So I quickly reached for my vape to take a hit and just thought to myself, ""why don't you wait and see how much longer you can go vape-less?"" and I liked the idea so I put it back.  And BINGO, that was the last time, months had passed and I've never touched it again. Threw all my vape and smoking stuff away and never looked back.   


All that process that I've just told you about took me about a month and a half, from starting to Juul until having my last vape drag. But that doesn't mean that you can do it in 1.5 months as well, I was pretty aggressive and fast about it so it didn't take me long but it's different for everyone.",stopsmoking

I quit smoking for 5 months and tonight i got drunk with my friends at party and smoked about 5 6 cigs .. Please give some advice,stopsmoking
"I started vaping in 2018. Starting in 2020 I tried to stop several times - most attempts lasted a few weeks before I would get triggered (usually by drinking socially with friends who use nicotine). This most recent time I decided to use nicotine pouches to help quit. I think the hardest part for me was the hand-to-mouth habit, so I figured I would try to break that without dealing with nicotine withdrawal on top of it. I started at 6mg pouches using three per day and over a couple of weeks tapered down to one 3mg pouch daily until a month ago when I stopped completely. It was pretty easy and after a couple of days I didn‚Äôt really think of it or miss smoking or nicotine at all. However, the past two days it‚Äôs been all I can think about and the urge to go buy a disposable vape is almost unbearable. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or has any advice to help get through this part without relapsing again? 

I should also add that I just made a cross country move. I stopped vaping just before leaving and used the pouches during the road trip and stopped using nicotine completely just before arriving in my new city. I thought it would be easier since I don‚Äôt have anything here that I associate with vaping (unlike before when I was used to taking smoke breaks at work with my co-workers and drove past my favorite vape shop frequently, etc.)

Well, because I would like to continue having drinks (and also not change my whole lifestyle at once because I know how well that works for me) with friends but not smoke, I'm now gonna try having drinks at home for a while to get used to it.

The first week is horrible. The addiction makes sure of that. It tries to trick you into ""just one more smoke"", and everything is just aggravating and not fun. BUT that one week at the beginning is worth everything else that follows.

By my second week I remember getting in my boyfriend's car after he picked me up and turning to him; ""Wow you smell really nice today!"" I said, ""Are you wearing cologne?""

And he replied, ""I am. I wear it every day. I always wondered if you liked it.""

This floored me. Cigarettes stole my ability to smell how amazing my boy smelt. And within the first two weeks I was able to get that back. And that experience set the tone for the rest of my quitting experience.

"Hello! Just found this subreddit. I was addicted to cigarettes for a couple years, I smoked a pack a day for maybe a year, cut down a lot by rolling my own and vaping, and eventually fully quit sometime last year. I've bought a couple packs since then, usually smoked part of it, remembered how shitty it feels, and gave the rest away. 

I work at a restaurant and many of my coworkers smoke or vape and would offer me some. At first I didn't  see an issue with it but now I'm stuck with this problem/habit where for many months, I smoke almost like I'm addicted to it Friday- Sunday when I work (I do doubles all weekend and then get 4 days off lol) where on a ""good day"" I'll only have one cigarette but sometimes up to like 4 or 5 especially if I drink which we can do for free there when we close. And then go through withdrawals every Monday Tuesday and Wednesday, but my bf smokes cigarettes and recently I've been bumming some from him on those days and been close to being fully physically addicted again a couple times and made myself stop for a week or so before inevitably bumming more. 

I have no mental issue with going days/a week without nicotine if I'm not around it, I've done it very often. But I recognize the amount I'm still smoking negatively affects me almost every day and I've tried every strategy I know of to stop. I set up reward systems for going without for a week/2 weeks/a month, I journaled about how it makes me feel, I got hemp cigarettes, I told people not to offer to me. And even then I can't stop myself from asking at least my bf (we work together) at least once a day when I work.

"Nearing the 96 hour mark and this is the closest to quitting I have gotten in a while! I keep trying and keep failing, and every time I failed I said the same words ""just 1 smoke."" There was never just one. One quickly turns to two, two to three, and before I know it I'm at a pack a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember the first cigarette I smoked. It was 2018 and I was my first week into med school. We were celebrating with some drinks and my roommate pulled out a pack of cigarettes. I had never smoked cigarettes in my life, never wanted to do it neither. Whenever someone offered I would say ""no thank you"" and usually leave because I couldn't stand the smell of cigarettes. However, while a tad bit too tipsy I took a cigarette and lit it up. And oh man that rush that gets you the first time...it was incredible. Weeks went by and I smoked a cigarette here and there, nothing too serious, but then came the end of our first semester...exams were nearing, stress was high and I needed a damn smoke...and then another one....and then, of course, another one. Quickly in a matter of weeks I started smoking a pack a day till the end of that semester.

  
Then came my first break, had about a week off before next semester started and in that week I managed to quit. Barely touched another cigarette for the next 7 months, even my smoker friends would say ""No"" even when I'd repeatedly bother them for one. Then came fourth semester! The start of 2nd year with the largest hurdle over (1st year, particularly 3rd semester). I was at an all time high, stress was at an all time low, things were looking up! And then I thought, ""well damn, a cigarette would be good right now."" 

And that's where the next 2.5 years of my life went downhill with smokes. Now I wasn't smoking because I was stressed, I was smoking because I was happy! In a fantastically idiotic fashion it meant I was smoking all the time for every possible reason! Again, within a few weeks I was at a pack a day! At least this time I had thought of an alternative. I was going to get a vape! I got some Juul with pods and started tossing those back 2 - 3 pods a day. It was great because I didn't have to leave my room to hit a Juul like I had to with a cigarette so I could just do it every minute of every day! Wake up in the morning and still in bed? Juul. Taking a shit? Juul. About to jump into the shower? Juul! Juul, juul, juul all the time. 

And this kept up for the remainder of my 2nd year with really no attempts to quit. At times I went back to cigarettes. The feeling of lighting one up and taking the first puff. The delicious taste of ash in my mouth. I'm honestly not quite sure what it is, but there was just something about smokes that vapes just could not replicate.

My 3rd year though was where my eyes opened and I made several attempts, and of course, failed every time. 3rd year is when the game changes a bit. It's no longer locked in the library or in your room studying. No, now you're on the floor, working, interacting with patients and their families. I ran into a few attending physicians that smoked, you could smell them a mile away when they came back from their ""break"".  I wanted a break. I took my breaks. Cigarette in the morning after waking up, before I showered to be sure I didn't smell before I got to the hospital. Cigarette after morning rounds, didn't want my residents and attendings to get a whiff. Cigarette after lunch. Cigarette on my way home. Cigarette here, cigarette there, cigarettes everywhere! 

Saw my patient dying of COPD exacerbation? ""Damn I could use a smoke after that..."" Patient with COPD and COVID has their heart stop in the ICU and I had to do chest compressions? ""Fuck I need a smoke."" How does that make sense? I don't know, you tell me...

It's like there are these little cigarette monkeys in my head that start running around whenever they get a chance. I had always thought quitting was ""easy"". ""I just have to stop,"" I would say. I can start using smokeless tobacco like snuff pouches to wean myself down. I even tried that, went from using 1 8mg pouch every so often, to popping 2x6mg pouch every now and then (somehow managed to up the dose see? 8 just wasn't cutting it! And before I knew it I would be popping pouches while smoking cigarettes or hitting a vape. 

But don't worry. ""It's easy."" 

""It's easy."" Is the worst thing I have ever told myself about anything. Ever since 3rd year ended a few weeks ago I have had a lot of time to sit and think. It seems almost universally true in my life that when I say ""it's easy"" I get lazy. ""Losing and keeping weight off is easy!"" Proceeds to put on 30 lbs. ""Putting on muscle is easy!"" Proceeds to slack at the gym and atrophy like nobody's business. ""Damn this class is really easy"" Proceeds to get lazy and by some heavenly blessing still manage to do well. 

""Easy"" is the worst word I had ever learned. Nothing is easy. This time I have convinced myself that this is one of the hardest things I will ever do. I need to quit and to do that I need to stay vigilant. No lapses, no relapses. If not for myself then for my patients.

I am at 96 hours. I no longer feel like murdering everyone around me. I think this is going well but I don't think it's going easy. This is unbelievably hard.",stopsmoking

I was the one who quit first. Had a health scare because my lungs were pretty fucked. They were a smoker at the time but I think that kind of banged some clarity into them, so they quit. We did together you could say.

Now yesterday they mentioned that they were on a smoke break. And they mentioned it again too. They did it so casually.. I'm sure they know that it would have upset me. Do they think it's cool and wanna show off so that's why they mention it, despite my feelings? Before they tried to quit my friend had a group they smoked with and romanticized it too.

I haven't talked to them about it. I just ignored it as if they didn't say it. I feel like if I bring it up I will seem over-controlling or something. I know it's their decision so I can't be angry at them but it makes me sad.

"Hey guys. I quit smoking cigarettes 4 days ago. I still vape nicotine though until I feel comfortable enough to quit entirely.
Today is a very harsh day. My girlfriend left to go out and I decided to go for a walk. The city is quite full of people but I don‚Äòt really feel like socialising. Right now I‚Äòm trying super hard not to give in and buy myself a pack of cigarettes to kill the loneliness. I feel like I just want to walk around town and smoke cigarettes the whole night.

I guess I just want to vent but any advice on how to cope with that feeling would be appreciated.

"I understand why it's easy to believe the opposite. You've gone an hour or two without a cigarette, you start to feel the nicotine pang, so you smoke. Suddenly you feel much better and more relaxed.

But the fact is, nicotine was creating anxiety and tension, and smoking another simply makes you feel the way non-smokers feel all the time.

There is absolutely no credible scientific evidence that nicotine helps with tension or anxiety. It is simply not true when someone explains that they continue to smoke because it helps them relax. It absolutely does not.

Ask any smoker who has quit and started again. With those first few cigarettes, you feel absolutely nothing, no relaxed feeling, no sigh of relief. It's because you aren't addicted yet, and your body hasn't begun creating that anxiety and tension that cigarettes invariably create.",stopsmoking

I'll cut to the chase right away: once managed to go 18h without smoking, a year later went for 3-4 days (with patches and gum). I smoke about 15-20 cigs a day on busy days, but also can happily go with less than 10. I smoke since about 11 years, started when I was 14 years old and I hate it a lot.

I spend between 240‚Ç¨ - 1.200‚Ç¨ a year on cigs/tobacco and the money doesn't phase me as much as it should, idk why.

Now I need advice from anybody who successfully lasted longer than just 3 days, because I really can't bother with it anymore, but I'm obviously addicted to it. It's not even for health reasons that I wanna stop, or for money, as I'm stable and got a decent endurance.

Tried a few different strategies such as quitting at night. Quitting in the morning. Quitting during the day. Quitting on the patch or lozenge. Quitting while I am off work. Quitting while I am working. I am on champix now. I tried it years ago and it felt like it worked. Like I didnt feel like smoking but did anyways because I wasnt ready to quit. Ive been on it for 2 weeks today and it doesnt feel as helpful as before. Like it kind of makes me forget about smoking but theres still mad cravings every so often. I went 30hrs until this afternoon and cracked and bought a pack for no other reason because I am a little bitch and was being an idiot. I originally felt like if I could just get 1 day under my belt I would be able to beat this. Now I just dont know what to do or feel. Like youre supposed to pick a quit date within 2 weeks of champix and im there now and am worried it will not work if I keep smoking. Im a sober alcoholic (4 years tomorow ü§úü§õ) and when I realized that I ""got"" sobriety was when I stopped counting the days I was sober because the time in doesnt matter only the today does. Im trying to have that make sense with smoking but it seems like its all about how many days it is equals your success. I dont know if that makes any sense. Alcohol for me was an acute disease. Absolutely binge drinking wrecklessness that could of killed me or anyone else in my path at any time. Smoking is this chronic addiction that takes a little bit at a time but isnt as near term devastating as alcohol is. So it almost doesnt seem ""that bad"" or that I must quit sooner than later even though I want to. Enough is enough.

I‚Äôve tried to quit a few times before, but I‚Äôve always gone right back to it. I think I‚Äôve figured out why I was never successful. I didn‚Äôt want to quit. It was a comfort to me. I knew it was hurting me, but I wasn‚Äôt ready to let it go.

The first few days I was so emotionally all over the place, but I stuck through them and wrote lots of notes about my motivation to quit (let me know if anyone is interested in this, happy to post)

Anyway, after making it past a week, I'm surprised because the biggest withdrawal symptom I'm having is just general sadness and malaise. I'll go to the beach, or for a walk, and am so sad that I can't smoke that I'm not enjoying my day to day as much. I used to enjoy smoking and vaping particularly when I'm alone. 

You hear people who give up smoking or vaping say that they always miss it, but I really feel like I've lost an old friend and I'm hoping this feeling diminishes over time.

I'm hoping others can share their stories of how they felt while quitting, if sadness was a side effect for anyone else, and if I can expect this to pass. How long until I don't want to throw a tantrum and cry because I miss nicotine?

The entire flat stinks‚Ä¶ Other is a close friend. She never told me she smoked but I kinda knew. Few days ago I ‚Äúcaught‚Äù a dirty ashtray in her room‚Ä¶ I thought she was quitting, but, oh well‚Ä¶

I try to convince myself these urges are of the same kind as when I had never smoked, that made me start smoking in the first place. That I‚Äôm no worse off for having smoked before and been through the fight. But I‚Äôm still scared.

Do any of you relate? I‚Äôd love to read your experiences! It‚Äôd help a lot!

I'm hoping someone could give me some advice as google is giving me very mixed results

Have a slight cough now but have noticed the nicotine urges aren‚Äôt strong compared to when I was ending my day 2.

But my taste and smell now are better compared to before so there‚Äôs one noticeable change! 

After that night, I knew I couldn‚Äôt be near or around my house for awhile because everything was so triggering/anxiety-inducing so I spent all of my Day/Night 3 with my (non-smoker!) SO. That helped a lot ‚Äî urges went away and cravings were easier to quiet down. I was also happy because I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my breath, hands, clothes, or hair smelling like smoke around him. 

Also kinda crazy but while we were out, I would suddenly become aware of how many smokers there actually are. I would see them smoking in their cars while driving, at the back of the restaurant‚Äôs entrance, at a really hidden spot in the parking lot ‚Äî things like that.

Im so glad that I could join because i can see lot common problems we ex smokers face and lot of inspiration and encouragement from people who could kill this addiction for good. 

I have smoked for 10 years and most recent  rate of smoking was like two packs for three days. 

Since last year i was on a successful journey of quitting smoking stayed close to 5 months out of smoking 2020 june to December. And picked it up again and on and off couple of times. And stopped on my 32nd birthday 19th of 2021 and going on being a happy non smoker ever since.  Just 29 days. But every quit attempt counts and yeah there will be pangs and cravings but we should become bigger than the addiction. Trying to be conscious about my thoughts which immensely helps me on control acting automatically on usual queues which leads me to go and buy a pack.

somedays it gets rough and really tough, fighting with my own thoughts. But if some how I managed to overcome the temptation to smoke the next day it feels like a victory and make me feels like the next time its gonna be a lot  easier to neglect cravings and continue living happily .

thats all i got to say so for now. Wish everyone have  the courage and mentality to lose the desire to stop smoking which makes this whole process a lot easier. After all we are already non smokers aint we ?cz at this exact moment no body has that filthy stick in our mouths. 
So lets be happy in the moment right now and nothing else matters!

I started smoking again regularly last weekend. My husband is extremely mad at me . Ive been struggling with it off and on for the past 4 years. I was a regular smoker from 12 to 19 and the  in my early 20s started again for a while. He was so mad when he seen me smoking out back. He told me I could go live somewhere else. I feel so embarrassed  that I keep getting into this. I did email my therapists today and Im going to see what help I can get there.  The way he gets mad when I smoke makes me feel like a worthless loser. I know he hates smoking..I wish I would stop getting myself into this trap. I hate how I feel this week. Its terrible. Tomorrow Ill get mints again that have smaller amount of nicotine.  It also doesn't help that we have to be tight with out money. I hate that when I smoke I want to chain smoke.

"I quit cold turkey about 5 months ago, and about 2 weeks ago I had 2 weeks when I pretty much ""made up my mind"" to take up smoking again. I would think about it constantly, I still don't know how I found the mental strength not to do this in the end. This shows, however, how difficult this process has been for me. I had really strong cravings for at least 2 months, whereas most online sources will tell you that you are completely free after 3-6 weeks, which constantly made me wonder what was wrong with me and if I can even succeed. My friend who quit at the same time as me also pretty much forgot about the addiction after maybe 3 months. I haven't. It is not too bad most of the time, but I still feel like I'm lacking something.

"After smoking for more than 27 years I had my last cigarette 10 years ago tonight. I took a pull off of what could easily have been my 30th cigarette of the day, and somehow I saw how disgusting smoking really is. The smell, my fingers, my breathing, that cough, that grimy feeling. I threw my smoke to the ground where it belonged and said ""fuck this, fuck this shit, fuck off"" and turned my back on it. I made that decision and I stuck to that decision. Not a puff since. 

The difference between this and every other time I tried to quit was a deep seeded feeling of determinatiin, that I was going to be  bigger than the addiction. I was going to be in control of myself and my actions. I didnt tell anyone either, not even my wife. She noticed at some point, but I think I went 3 months before telling anyone else. No added pressure that way.

For any numbers oriented folks, 30 cigarettes a day over 10 years is 109,500 cigarettes not smoked. Thats a fucking lot of cigarettes. Maybe 10+ pulls on each, that a million pulls...

I used to get up at night to pee and I would light a smoke, so if I can do it and keep doing it, it is in all of us, you just have to really want it, enough to put yourself in charge, not the smoke. Good luck to everyone struggling, I know I tried to quit many times. The best immediate advice I can give is DO NOT have that first cigarette of the day.",stopsmoking

"A couple of things to know about me.

1) I‚Äôm clean and sober
2) Cigarettes, coffee, and chocolate were my vices.

I didn‚Äôt plan on quitting 72 hours ago.  No way.  But because of my insanely wild party past, I‚Äôve had - to put it mildly - a lot of oral health issues.  Over the last few years I did everything you could do to beautify a mouth (and still smoke) except the one thing I needed to truly make my mouth whole again.  Bone grafts.  

The other day a front crown broke and I went to see my dentist.   I figured it would be an easy fix and I‚Äôd have my smile back.  Nope. They did some  x-rays and I needed those grafts now if I was ever to have a non-denture smile again.  So I had a choice.  Quit smoking on the spot or put it off and run the risk of losing all my teeth.

In a split second, I chose to quit smoking.  I ran outside to my car and inhaled my final two cigarettes.  My partner was with me so we threw anything related to smoking in a bag, brought it in to the office, and trashed it.   

I got the bone grafts and here I am almost on hour 72 and, yes, it‚Äôs really really hard.  I can‚Äôt do much in the way of movement or exercise because of the grafts.  I also can‚Äôt eat anything beyond smoothies/blended foods and my face is swollen beyond belief.   The past 12 hours or so have been brutal.  The cravings have reached a fever pitch and I‚Äôm floored by how powerful drugs like nicotine are.  I mean, my brain is throwing every excuse in the book to smoke at me.  Suns out?  You should smoke.  Have some work to do?  You should smoke.  Light breeze blowing through the house?  You should smoke. 

Outside of round the world flights I‚Äôve taken, I haven‚Äôt gone this long without a cigarette since I started as a kid.  I‚Äôve chosen to go cold turkey on this because my home is littered with patches and pills and lozenges and vapes all bought with good intentions and all barely ever used.  

As a recovering alcoholic and addict for many years, I intrinsically know that what I‚Äôm experiencing won‚Äôt last forever but damn if my mind isn‚Äôt telling me over and over that I‚Äôll never feel normal again.

As far as sleeping with the patches on I had some weird dreams but nothing too crazy. I‚Äôm overall very pleased with myself. Been smoking for 16+ years half a pack a day Marlboro red 100s. I also used the quit start smoking app which keeps me distracted. I found if I stay busy I don‚Äôt have the urge. Thought I‚Äôd share, have a great day everyone! ‚úä",stopsmoking

In 7 hours I‚Äôll be free from nicotine for three days. I smoked from when I was 18 until I was 32 and then I started again in December.

"I've only been a smoker for about a year. Hell, I still consider myself one. Once an addict, always an addict, that's how I see it, some things people don't forget. 

I've been mening to quit for a while and finally developed a tactic by which to succeed. I originally wanted to reduce the smoking, be it day by day, or week by week and have loosely been doing that, but it didn't work in the long term. I have also been using a product known as snus, a nicotine pouch placed between the gums and inner lip, that wasn't to reduce my habit of smoking though, I just wanted more of a kick out of nicotine, as I didn't really catch a buzz off cigarettes alone anymore. 

I now only use snus and don't smoke. This is day 1 for me. I still get to feel some nicotine and perpetuate the ritualistic habit the drug entails for me. This is my solution. 

It does however keep me hooked on nicotine. I don't crave snus as much as cigarettes though, so it'll be an easier transition to stopping my use of nicotine altogether. People used to tell me how tough it was to quit. I believe them now. It's tough, but possible. All you need is something to make the transition easier. Be it the occasional smoke or a substitute. It's not something that happens in one day. It's a treacherous road to take.",stopsmoking
"I'm tired of coughing, tired of spending so much, tired of stopping whathever I'm doing and getting out to get my fix. Most of all, I'm tired of smoking in front of my children and giving them a bad example.

First, let's state the obstacles :

1. Nicotine is addictive

2. My girlfriend smokes too and would like to stop too, but she is not ready to stop. Whenever I see her smoking, I get a strong craving.

3. My life is very stressful with all the things I have to take care of : my family, my studies, my mental health. 

I have managed to reduce a lot in the last few weeks. I don't buy packs anymore, but cigarettes are always available if I ask my girlfriend. She says she wants to be supportive and help me stop, but I can't really count on her with this. I have to do this mostly on my own. 

If you have read this far, I guess I would need advice about quitting when I live with someone who smokes. 

Thank you, have a good day!",stopsmoking
"I made it guys!! A complete year today. Overall, god damn do I feel better than I did when I was smoking.

I was not a heavy smoker. I started with cigarettes (maybe a pack a week), and then I started vaping. Oh lord did that got me addicted to nicotine. I was smoking 30mg at the beginning which is enormous. At the end, I was at 3mg. Then one day I told myself: after this bottle, i‚Äôm over. I did smoke 2-3 cigarettes in the first week of trying to stop, but after that, it was OVER.

First month was very hard. Me and my bf both stopped at the same time. We were literally screaming at each other permanently for absolutely no reason lol. But then, I started to feel less tired and weird when I woke up in the morning. I felt overall less stressed troughout the day (I still do sometimes due to an anxiety disorder) but it has been easier dealing with it.

Now, I hardly even think of smoking anymore. Sometimes i‚Äôll see coworkers or friends do it and for a split second I miss it, but the thought of it passes as quick as it arrived. I never get urges to smoke. It‚Äôs always just a brief thought of it, and to be able to say no to it without feeling angry is so rewarding and feels so powerful.

What helped me get through it I would say is just the thought of having a better health, more money in my pockets, and tbh, a big ego lol. Also, i‚Äôm still super young (22f) so stopping now was the best thing to do for my future self.

In retrospection, this year has had its ups and downs, but hey, I havent smoked!!!! today i am also celebrating 7 days without alcohol!! If you really want to stop, I believe in you. You are stronger than this nicotine bitch. I hope you all a very good day :).

"I was able to stop smoking cigarettes for the most part by switching to vaping, mainly juul pods which are way more addicting to me. Salt nicotine coupled with the fact I can hit it just about anywhere left me with a strong and expensive habit. 

I was planning on getting some snus pouches, but they didn't have any so I grabbed these on! Nicotine pouches which are filled with a soft white powder. They've helped me put sometime between vaping and not which will help me in a few weeks when I do a quick taper from these pouches. Also saving me A LOT of money. $5-$8 a day turned into $1.25 a day and soon $0 a day on something that I don't need or really even want! 

The pouches are also small enough that when I put them in my upper lip it's not noticeable.

"I quit smoking 413 days ago and have not have a single drag of a single cigarette until day 411. I was at the wedding of two of my oldest friends and had a few cigarettes during the reception over some drinks. Whilst it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm proud of or happy about - it was okay!

Square one was me smoking 20-30 cigarettes a day for 13 years. Having 5 cigarettes in 411 days is one of the greatest achievements of my life. I haven‚Äôt bought a packet of cigs since, nor a pouch of tobacco. I‚Äôve not been craving or wanting them, I was casually and socially smoking.

This isn‚Äôt the reality for everyone, and some people can‚Äôt just have a few one time and stop and that‚Äôs absolutely fine. But remember a blip isn‚Äôt back to square one. If every day is a new square, you‚Äôre just paused on 411.

"Once you went back to smoking did you suddenly go back to being your old self and forget about the painful months of withdrawal you went through when you first quit?

I‚Äôm curious to know this because I quit a little over 4 months ago cold turkey after smoking for 12 years (since 16), it was my first quit ever but the difference between me and some of you is that I didn‚Äôt want to quit.

I did it because of a health scare that turned out to be nothing and decided that I might as well just continue quit but i‚Äôm 4 months in and having a hard time still, perhaps because I didn‚Äôt have a goodbye or the urge to quit didn‚Äôt come from me but external circumstances‚Ä¶ 

Anyway, this is my question to all people who‚Äôve relapsed, did you feel like yourself again after you relapsed? Did it kill your depression/anxiety? I‚Äôve noticed that people who relapse often stop coming to this sub, it must mean that they went on with their livrs as smokers forgettinf about the mental state of withdrawal misery.

After 4 months I still think I‚Äôm forcing myself to stay quit and I‚Äôm still unhappy because I don‚Äôt get to smoke like I used to (I‚Äôm still suffering from some withdrawal anxiety but nothing crippling, anxiety that was non existant back when I used to smoke).",stopsmoking

Everything good but the next saturday i went for a beer with my friend &amp; I thought if I drink I allow myself to smoke. As I took a couple sips of my beer I started smoking - but it was disgusting I really didn‚Äôt enjoy the cig but it kinda felt like it had to be done. So I finished didnt smoke anymore all good no cravings nothing next week, but last saturday I drank a couple of beers with friends &amp; for somereason I thought, Ill smoke anyways -might aswell buy a pack instead of asking all the time. Well this time I had cravings the other day &amp; the day after &amp; everyday &amp; each day i buy cigs smoke a couple get mad &amp; throw the pack away but inthe morning the cravings are so much stronger than the will to not smoke.. its so sad üò™ I have to get back on track- I was doing so good so long - how could i mess up like this.. againüò≥ (not the first time i quit ~3months &amp; started again)

"So I'm not sure how long it's been since I quit. I found that for myself, keeping track of the days only kept my kind on cigarettes so I'm treating it like it was mever a part of my life. It's been less than a couple weeks, probably.

I'd quit for 3 months at a time or more, then pick it up again and I've repeated this probably 10 times over the last 10 years. My parent's families are both huge and they had me late and dad's genes aren't the best so everytime I'd quit, someone died. Been to about 12 funerals in that time span and not to mention both my parents smoke like chimneys, but I don't like making excuses and I felt shitty every time I picked it back up. So here's to hoping I don't have to forget how long it's been since my last cigarette again. 

I've never reached out to a forum or platform of any kind so I'm hoping airing it out a little bit will give me a greater sense of responsibility to stay off it. 

Full disclosure I smoke the equivalent of about half a joint of weed a day or less and that significantly helps with withdrawals and insomnia (cessation and non-cessation related)

i quitted smocking almoust a year ago, i never had any heavy symtoms but recently i started to become nightmares about smoking again.  To be fair the dreams i have are nothing scary but rather realisticly, so i may started smoking again.

The way i approached my exit strategy was simple, i switched to vaping and tried to figure out why i would smoke in the first place. Since i read that this is how you would approach any other addiction.

When i figured out why i smoked i could easilly quit but now even though i sucsessfully quitted for a year now without any feel of quit im right in this weird situtation and i wonder if people did experience the same.

To be fair i changed alot along quitting, like doing more sports and only for that i would never go back to smoking. But it is weird that my brain seems to still be busy with that.",stopsmoking
"I‚Äôm still a tad bit in the surreal zone and needed somewhere to air my thoughts. I‚Äôm on day 6 (tomorrow is one week) and I‚Äôm proud of myself (probs the most ever). I‚Äôve been mostly caffeine free for the years (sweet tea only), I am off and on with weed, I drink a maximum of one soda a day, and now no cigarettes. Super surreal that this day has come.

Here‚Äôs the story.. I started in middle school off and on and that continued increasing until hs. Senior year, I quit. Come time to go to bars and clubs, I was back to socially smoking. That eventually spilled over into every day life. Over the years, I‚Äôd set dates to quit. Like the back of the shampoo bottle, rinse and repeat. Tons of failures over the years (light failures because was my mind really there/ready to quit?). Then I set a hard date where I had to quit, that passed by which was last year. Then September hit and my brain realized I had just swept it under the rug like nothing and so at that point I made a promise to myself to quit by October 1st, but this time had to be different because I was just not going to buy another pack. Pack after pack the cravings pushed me to give in, but my rule was when you finish a pack you have to wait as long as you can before giving in. The longest I made it was 16 hrs without buying a pack. Last Friday hit, my last cig in the pack was around mid day and I started getting that feeling so I pushed it to the end of the day cig before bed.

The biggest part of it, in my opinion, is being ready. Nobody else can do that for you. For me, I asked myself if I want to smoke a year from now and it‚Äôd always be an answer of no, but I never pushed myself to do something about it. The second biggest thing is to talk to someone (in my case it is a friend) who has quit so there‚Äôs the relatable portion of knowing what its like.

As of right now, I still take my ‚Äúsmoke breaks‚Äù just to get away and let it all go, I still have cravings, I still love cigs, but they‚Äôre not for me. I put them into the same place as some of the harder things I used to do,,, they‚Äôre not for me.

"I quit smoking for one year, and three months.  My longest ever!  I was so proud.  The longest I ever got before was 10 months.  I tried to get to one year for‚Ä¶..years.  And I did.

And then I relapsed.  For a couple of months.  Disgusting, out of breath, smelly, exhausted, and sore all the time.  

Quitting smoking has been so much harder than quitting drinking and other stuff.  I am seriously seriously dependent on it.  Stopped smoking a couple weeks ago and am chewing gum like crazy.  Sweating, shaky.  I hate it.  Then today went back to smoking for a few hours and have finally said that‚Äôs IT.  All of it.  Cold turkey.  I have had enough.

I‚Äôm so scared because I know how hard the beginning is.  I know it gets much much better but the next couple of weeks is going to be an emotional roller coaster hell.

So that‚Äôs it.  I have now quit all nicotine for a total of like 3 hours.

"Weekly update ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Things are going well! In the last week I've only thought about smoking a handful of times, and none of them were particularly long or strong cravings. We had a friend over last Saturday who still smokes and it felt odd not to be joining him, but I wasn't feeling particularly tempted to. I sat out with him once just for the company, but the smell really put me off.

My anxiety and agitation are down. I'm having an easier time focusing. Things in general are looking up.

Hubby smoked half a cig a couple days ago at work after 11 days without. He said it made him feel like trash afterwards, headachy and nauseated. We talked about how the addiction lied to him. It told him ""your break will feel better with me"" and made him feel sick instead, which increased his stress the rest of the day instead of relieving it. I'm proud of him for keeping going. A stumble doesn't have to be a fall.

I'm on my 4th day. I feel good. After 10 years of smoking, almost pack a day for last year or so I managed to...just stop. Without any patches etc. I only used QuitSure (not sponsored post, seriously). Craving were minimal, urge too. No headaches, no depression. I feel really good. 
But tomorrow might be an issue. I'm gonna meet some friends. There's gonna be some alcohol. I remember that every time I met them I smoked A LOT. I have this stupid feeling that ""beer without a cigarettes is not a good beer"". I know it's just nicotine talking, this is completely not true, I can enjoy everything without cigs even morex, without urge creeping underneath... 
Even worse, most of those pals are smokers. I'll have one non-smoker to aid me, but I'm just so scared that I'll break.

"Hey all, 

I'm 41. For the last 12 months or so I was smoking one or two ciggies a day + having a bunch of ciggies when I was out partying which was once every couple of months (lockdown!)

I'd been more-or-less off cigarettes for a year before then, but I'd smoke when I was at the pub etc. 

I was a heavy smoker from 20 to 30 years old, but most of my 30's I'd cut back to 3 or 4 a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had a cigarette for about a month now. I can feel my body repairing itself and there's a lot of mucus etc. and I occasionally feel a little sore in (one side) of my chest. I've seen a doctor and had my blood pressure checked, done a blood test, had an ECG etc. and there's nothing to report there. 

I'm guessing what I'm feeling will pass, and I've read it can take up to 5 months for your lungs to start functioning normally. 

Just wondering if anyone whose been off the cigarettes had these sort of symptoms?

"I've only been a nicotine addict for less than a year (since I turned 21), and I've been successfully been able to avoid it for over two weeks now, but the daily cravings and need to convince myself not to give in almost every day is getting frustrating. I'm a student and I managed to stay away from nicotine for about 2 months over the summer, but started the habit again when the semester started until I stopped it recently. The cravings have been relatively easy to disregard since a little before the 1st of the month, but today for whatever reason I've been debating with myself whether I should allow myself ""just one"" smoke all day. And at the gas station this evening while getting snacks, I was SO close to giving in and asking the cashier for a Black &amp; Mild. The only thing that stopped me was convincing myself to be content with the alcohol I was already buying, and admitting to the cashier that I was conflicted over whether I should buy a black n mild, which made me feel pathetic. I know this is kind of incoherent and ramble-y but I feel so much like a failure and like such a piece of shit, and would like some advice/encouragement.

I'm getting very hungry one or two hours after eating and nothing seems to properly satisfy my hunger. I'm not eating for comfort, but because I feel so physically hungry.

Went back to sleep but remembered when I woke up and gave it a go. I often had those thoughts at 3 in the morning‚Ä¶ I usually ignored them by the time I got up. I honestly can‚Äôt tell you why it was different this time.. sometimes you just build up the will power.

I‚Äôm 45.  I‚Äôve  smoked for 30 years‚Ä¶ mostly 20 a day but probably 25 the past couple of years. It hasn‚Äôt done me any favours with my skin, hair, breathing, fitness, savings.  This is probably my 4th serious quit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve managed 3, 9 and 12 months before.   I hope this is the one.

Im waffling on‚Ä¶ the reason I‚Äôm posting is to give some reassurance to those a few weeks behind my journey. I found it really difficult for most of the first 5 and a half weeks‚Ä¶ some good days to keep me sane but otherwise it just felt relentless. Never ending . Week 3 was particularly hard until I realized it was week 3 and just needed to get through it. Week 5 was a nightmare because I thought week 3 was supposed to be the worst!

But now, all of a sudden, it‚Äôs so so much easier.  I can focus on the positives of not smoking rather than constantly mourn the loss. Theres still a couple of times a day when I‚Äôd love a smoke, and I think about them often‚Ä¶ that probably sounds scary but it‚Äôs not that bad at all‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not in that all consuming way of the first 5 weeks. It‚Äôs such a relief.  It does get better. It does get easier. I‚Äôm so pleased with myself when I remember that I forgot to think about smoking.

My husband is a very dedicated smoker so there‚Äôs always tobacco in the house‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs ok.  The trick is to remember that in x amount of months, when I think I can just have one, I can‚Äôt.  I hope this time sticks.

I've been smoking and vaping for a while now 
Just today my vape ran out (it was an 800 puff disposable with 20mg/ml) and I've only had it since september 30th ish. I'd say I got into a habit of smoking/vaping around 2-3 times per day ish? Basically I would get buzzed before two of my classes, smoke at lunch instead of eating stuff LOL, and smoke for around an hour or less at night. 

Issue is, I've ran out of cash. Each vape costs me 14 bucks and since I already bought a bunch of comic books like a fucking nerd, I have no more money to spend on another vape. I told my friend and she says that I'm going to experience withdrawal really bad since i use it so often. 

How can I deal with withdrawal if I do start to experience it? My friend says it makes you irritable, which is something I obviously don't want. Is there like a home remedy I can try? I just want to be prepared, because if it's as bad as my friend says it is... that will suck.",stopsmoking

I've had almost none physical withdrawal symptoms and a few stronger-than-average cravings that I ofc acknowledged but didn't have to really struggle or anything. All the nicotine should've left my body by now, so it seems the physical addiction should be easing up. 

My question, I guess, is this: can it really be this easy? Or is the worst part still somehow coming..? üòÇ How to prepare myself for the future?

No longer ‚Äòpanic‚Äô if I‚Äôve run out of cigs nor stress if I‚Äôm running low (cos I don‚Äôt smoke). That really is incredible freedom and eventually becomes a norm without considering the previous burden.

I smoked for a year...I know that isn't long but I had a few major panic attacks and my tongue seems a bit different texture wise, but the doctors all said it's nothing to worry about. But since quitting about 9 months ago I think I've mostly gone back to normal.",stopsmoking

"Hello yall. So I've smoked for like 15 years, I'm also a recovering alcoholic and a relatively new one. I have been wanting/trying to quit for a few months. I've read the book, done the app, I've done patches but not the full regiment and I've done cold turkey. I feel better not smoking and the longest I've done was 2 weeks but I keep going back even though it's not ultimately what I want. I'm thinking I need to do the full patch regiment as recommended (21 for a couple weeks then 14 then 7) because cold turkey is not working for me.

"Hi all! I'm on week 6 of quitting smoking. I truly believe this is the last titime. It's been easier and I've had no trouble sticking to it. I smoked for 17 years off and on. The longest I quit was when I was pregnant but weirdly after I gave birth the cravings came back in full swing and I caved. 

Has anyone experienced strange side effects? This is my nth time quitting and first time experiencing these. 

Mine include drier skin. My skin seems more dehydrated which I know is weird since I should be more hydrated since quitting. 

My fingers and feet prune so fast. I used to be able to relax in the bath for an hr. Now? They prune so fast and severe that I am forced to get out after 25 minutes due to the pruning being painful. 

My food sensitivities, ex lactose intolerance, has worsened to a severe degree. It used to be an inconvenience but now I can't add cheese to a salad or cream to coffee with out my stomach sounding like the thunderdome the remainder of the day.

Don't tell anyone that you've quit smoking for as long as you can. When you do, they say ""congrats!"" or give you a high five which activated the reward center of your brain. You think ""Mission Accomplished! I'm doing great, might as well have one, nothing can stop this momentum.""

"Hi,

My boyfriend is very secretive about his smoking history because I had cancer before and he never smoked when I met him so when I asked he would just tell me it didn't matter. I know he was being honest about not smoking anymore because he's never lied to me in our relationship. I've asked him things from 6 months ago and he'll give the exact same, truthful answer. My point is that he was genuinely quit. He quit when he started dating his ex girlfriend and then smoked again for a while before quitting and then meeting me. 

This Thanksgiving we were going to his family's dinner and I was very stressed out and anxious, so I smoked a cigarette from a pack that I've had for over a year, that is more full than empty. He went outside with me and looked like a sad puppy dog, and asked me if he could have one puff off of it. I told him no initially but he promised that he just wanted to see if he even like it anymore. Well what do you know an addict trying an addictive substance would get him addicted again. Later when we got back to his home I wanted to smoke my medical Marijuana so he came out with me again and asked if he could have a cigarette. After I went home yesterday he went out and bought a pack. I'm so upset with myself, not with him. I gave him the puff and should have known better.

Does anyone know where I can go from here? I've never seen him be so happy and in such a good mood. I'm afraid now that he knows I won't be upset with him he will never stop. He doesn't seem like he ever wanted to quit in the past and only did it to convenience others. I'm not going to break up over it, this is my mess to clean up. I know I'm an awful girlfriend and I'm sorry to him and everyone here. Maybe I should break up with him because he would be better without me.",stopsmoking

"Hi everyone!

I was recently talking to someone about quitting smoking and decided to pop back on here to check my number to see how long it has actually been since I quit.  It's been over 4 years!

To anyone quitting now, I am proof that it is possible for anyone!

I quit at age 34 after trying to quit unsuccessfully for about a decade.  Remember that every time you try to quit, whether you succeed or not that attempt, you are closer to quitting.  I do believe that. 

I first quit at age 32 by reading Allen Carr's book ""Easy Way to Quit Smoking"".  

I had heard that if you read this book, you would quit immediately and not suffer through withdrawal.  It sounded like utter bullshit to me!  But, you were allowed smoke while reading it, so I figured I'd try it to prove what bullshit it was. 

I read the book.  It wasn't magic or anything.  It just goes bit by bit and convinces you that you don't need to smoke, and that you are just a drug addict stuck in the ""nicotine trap"".  I smoked the whole time I read it.  I finished it and went to bed.  I woke up the next day and didn't want to smoke. 

I quit for about 8 months.  Then I went to a party where everyone was smoking.  It had been so long and smoking looked so fun, I figured one cigarette wouldn't kill me.  Well, down the slippery slope I went.  Next time with friends, I bummed more cigarettes.  Soon, I was buying packs just for when I was going to be drinking.  Pretty soon after that, I was smoking again. 

Carr's book said that once you quit, all it will take is 1 cigarette to get you going again, and he was absolutely right!  I smoked for another year or so, absolutely furious with myself.  Finally, I decided that enough was enough and I was going to try to quit again.  I remembered everything I had read in the book, and was able to quit cold turkey and never smoke again!

I haven't had a cigarette in over 4 years, and I haven't missed it at all!  I am so thankful and happy that I do not have to smoke anymore.  I will be at parties and events now and try to mindfully think about how much I would have missed before because I was constantly running outside to smoke.  I take deep breaths and enjoy my clear lungs.  I look at the price of cigarettes at convenience stores and smile that I'm not shelling out thousands of dollars on it anymore.  

Not sure if this wall of text will be helpful to anyone, but I hope so.  If anyone is thinking of quitting, I'd recommend the book.  If anyone has already started, keep it up!  You really can do it!",stopsmoking
I have made a few attempts to quit smoking this years but all failed miserably. Now I am smoking a lot more than before i.e. 2.5 packs vs 1. I am trying my best to cut down but nothing works.

"I am smoking my last cigarette as I write this.  I've smoked a lot of last cigarettes.  If I look at my quit history, I have no reason to trust myself.  It's the addiction I can't trust.  The voices it uses.  

I'm scared.  I am afraid of emotional melt downs.  Especially at work.

"I'm pretty upset with her.  She smokes almost a pack every day.  She will spend 30 minutes smoking two or three at a time.   I quit about a year ago and have not touched one since.   Actually, I successfully quit 4 times, each for at least a few months.   I guess that doesn't really mean I was successful.   But living with a chain smoker is not easy.  She keeps promising to quit but doesn't even try.  She ""cuts back"" to quit but that only lasts a day or two

She just got back from a trip with her family.  They do not smoke and they do not know she does.  She keeps it a secret from them.  The trip lasted 10 days.  She promised that she would be done for good.  The very first thing she did as soon as she got back was buy a pack.  And honestly, I knew that's exactly what she was going to do

Apparently her aunt was a little mean to her on the trip.  So according to my wife her aunt is to blame.  And now once again she says the stress from work and dealing with Crohn's disease keep keep her smoking.  She also blames me because she says I can stress her out  

Honestly, this might be a deal breaker for me.  We cannot afford her addiction.  I tell her this often.  But it doesn't change a thing. I'm worried about her long term health which could very well bankrupt us when she needs to be hospitalized or develops severe illnesses.  

I don't want her to resent me.  I don't want to upset her.  I don't want to give her an ultimatum.  Those will only make her habit worse

I asked her to seek help from doctors, counselor, or anything  that will help her quit.  Nope.  Not going to happen 

I don't know what to do.  At this point I don't believe she will ever quit.  Most of her friends smoke and she hangs out with them a few times every week

Thanks for listening!",stopsmoking
"I‚Äôve cut down from half to whole pack per day to only a couple (2 max since Friday). I‚Äôve been feeling pretty run down and sick the past few days.

"So I‚Äôm two days off two months and I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of stress the past couple weeks which has made it so hard for me not to just smoke. I‚Äôve had a pack of tobacco that‚Äôs nearly full in the draw since I quit and nearly caved last night but didn‚Äôt.
I was thinking of possibly buying some nicotine free eliquid just in case for situations like that. Would you consider that a replapse? I do think it‚Äôs better to just go without as it could be a slippery slope but I‚Äôm also thinking that it‚Äôs better than actually having nicotine if I was to slip.

"So... I tried QuitSure.   
I was smoking a lot. For 10 years. Lately, due to covid and being locked at home, it jumped from 10 cigs a day to almost full pack a day. I was smoking heets, using IQOS.   
And with winter - cough came back. I'm currently checking with doctor if I have an asthma, armed with ventolin to survive. I can't go on like this.

I left home and visited my parents once. I didn't smoke while I was there and it was... hard, but easier than I thought it will be. I made a decision to quit it. This will be my third time.  
After going back home I found QuitSure. I decided to give this program a chance, why not? It's only 6 days, I can always try!

It's my day 2 of not smoking. I feel good. Urges are barely noticeable, triggers easy to manage and cravings seems to be... gone. Like app promised. Yeah, I get some memories like ""I used to smoke while doing this"", but it's very easy to deal with it.

"Hi,

"This is a huge accomplishment for me right now. I have to celebrate the small steps. I am on day 2 with no cigarettes. 

I‚Äôve smoked for 13 + years now about a half a pack a day if not more. I had zero motivation to quit before but recently I noticed I had this persistent cough and throat clearing that just never went away and it totally freaked me out enough that I decided enough was enough. 

I wanted to go cold Turkey but I knew it was going to be rough so I bought the step 3 nicoderm patch with the lowest dose of 7mg and figured this will help with the symptoms. It was definitely a lower dose than what my body was used to because I am still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms.

Day 1 - the urge to smoke was really strong, I really wanted a cigarette in the evening but I stuck my patch on and got through it. Definitely felt some restlessness at night.

Day 2 - today I began to feel slight flu-like symptoms like head pressure and body aches, twisting stomach sensation. But the urge to smoke wasn‚Äôt as bad. Feeing like crap makes me not want to smoke more. The anxiety is pretty high today too, I feel like I want to go running 5 miles just to help relieve the anxiousness

"Has anyone tried to cut smoking cold-turkey during a dietary water fast? 

I've quit nicotine quite a few times on my journey, 2 years has been my best attempt (so far). I've learned from my attempts that it's easier when I avoid other triggers, addictions, habits to gain ""willpower"". I spent the last month quitting weed and caffeine, and the past few weeks I've been going hard with yoga, exercise, breath-work and meditation to ""feel like a new person and disturb my habitual ruts"". 

I know I can do this without fasting, but I'm wondering if that has helped anyone? I could see it adding a bunch of extra stress on top of withdraws, but maybe it would be more beneficial in ways like speeding up withdraw recovery? I couldn't find any scientific literature on the subject (with nicotine anyways) but personally, once I water fast for 3/4 days I begin to feel amazing. The first 3 days of both fasting and nicotine withdraw are probably some of the hardest times I've put myself thru, but today I'm beginning both as sort of an experiment to test my willpower and to see if helps. 

I'm in my last semester to become a Dietitian, so I know quite a bit about diet, fasting and overall health. I have completed a lot of 3+ day water fasts so it's nothing new to me.

I need an answer for the question in the end of this text please!

I am 19 and have been smoking for 8 months, you will think that it's not that long of a period but trust me it has affected me mentally and physically so much that i hate myself now.
I wasn't a heavy smoker, i would smoke between 3 and 6 a day and there were some days when i don't smoke at all and here are the reasons:

1- i feel that i got uglier, my pupils got smaller and i have dark circles under my eyes.. my hair got thinner. When i see photos before starting to smoke it kills me, i want to cry.
2- it made my social life harder, and it made my relation with my parents so complicated when it was perfect.
3- I can hardly enjoy anything in life which sucks af.

"I cracked and bought a pack of tobacco. I had managed a biblical total of 40 days cigarette free. On the plus side that was the longest I've ever managed and I'm determined I'm not going to revert back to my former identity as a smoker now. 

Severe loneliness and burnout and low mood definitely contributed to cracking. I'm isolated and my ADHD and depression has been kicking my arse lately along with coping with other life stressors...but I think the main cause of caving was the fact that occasional vaping as part of nicotine reduction had crept up as a smoking substitute and I realised that the last few days I was actually consuming way more nicotine than as a smoker but without the unpleasant side effects of smoking and was therefore just swapping an identity as a smoker for one as a vaper when I had started out so strong with NRT. I know a lot of folks here equate vaping with smoking but personally the main thing I needed to mentally overcome was the habit of smoking and the ability to deceive myself that I need to be a smoker. But more importantly to learn to value myself as worth more than poisoning myself with these horrid things.

I've had a seriously low week with depression and haven't been able to eat or sleep well at all. I woke up early this morning and meditated and stretched and spent time with these feelings instead of avoiding them or beating myself up. I'm going to get through today with smokes and tonight the juul and the smokes are going in the bin. Plan is to pick up where I left off tomorrow morning after a good night's sleep but with nicotine patches and by consciously cultivating the mindset I had 41 days ago. I had grown complacent in the quitting process. 

Every cigarette I light smells and tastes absolutely foul and disgusting and makes me feel like a junkie.

"I‚Äôve been smoking for 13-15 years, i read about all the detrimentals health effects it might have on you. Damages to your lungs, loss of vocal box, throat cancer and many others smoking related diseases. I have also tried quitting MANY TIMES, going cold turkey before picking up another cig mere hours later. It was a brutal, endless cycle that seems to not helping. Best is 99 days 4 years ago and it was ruined by just ONE puff, which i thought was harmless. I also vape heavily. Low nicotine juice dont work for me, 50mg juices are my favourite and although i try using it as alternatives to cigaratte, it was not helping either. I will vape in the car and the moment i stepped outside, i will smoke 2 cigaratte. I felt vaping made my smoking habit worst. Also i believe, cold turkey doesnt work for me. And i stop giving up smoking. Life is short and everyone will die anyway so who cares? 


Eventually sometime in July last year, i decided to quit again. Not immediately but to do it on the day after my birthday, which was 3 months later back then. Since, i enjoy smoking more. Every cigarette i smoke, i enjoyed it. I appreciated every drag. As the date came closer for me to ‚Äòquit‚Äô, i realised smoking is not at all fun. It was a waste of time and money. I wouldnt believe it when i was a smoker but smoking WASTE YOUR TIME. Alot of time! I started to feel excited to quit. 

And on my birthday last year, the day i supposed to quit, i bought 3 packs of cigs. These are my last, so i bought menthol, normal and clove cigarattes. I sat in one bench and smoke away, reminiscing the time about the day i first started to smoke. I smoke 2,3,4 cigarette at a time. Every cig make me sick and i dont actually feel anything. It was not really enjoyable as i have thought. 

Night time comes and i know i should not smoke the next morning. Threw all my cig away except one stick (for emergency) I went to bed and slept the night. Next morning, i had a few urges and threw the last stick away and reminded myself that i am now a non smoker and keep doing that and get myself the mindset that smokers are a disgust and bunch of losers because they cant quit but i can do it and lo and behold, it has been one year now and i have zero craving for cigarette!

"Hey gang, 

I've done it - 19 days no smoking, a lifetime to go. It wasn't easy, but once I made it through the first few days I barely had any cravings. On day 3 I got an apple watch and started keeping track of my calories in an attempt to lose some of the weight I put on over the last few years. Cut out soda, and I'm already down 6lbs! Making big strides for my health obviously, but had a question:

I've been very depressed since I stopped smoking. Like it's something I've struggled with for a while but post-smoking it's sort of gotten a bit worse. Nothing worrisome that y'all should be concerned about, but just like, amplifying some dissatisfaction I've had in my life.

Lately I've really been considering major life revamps. Moving back to my hometown, starting over, all sorts of stuff like that. I'm wondering if any of you have had similar experiences 3 weeks in to your quit? I don't know how seriously to take these thoughts or whether I should sit on them until the smoke has cleared a little bit, but it's really been weighing on my mind and I don't know how much is real and how much is quit created mania",stopsmoking

"(TL;DR: Quit because you want to, not because someone tells you to)

&amp;#x200B;

Dear quitters of Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who quit smoking four years ago today, I want to share my insight and personal experience on what worked for me. I am in no way a professional or a counselor or qualified to give advice, I am just a person who has smoked for twelve years and decided on a Tuesday afternoon in October of 2017 that it was enough. I haven't relapsed once and these days I don't even think about it anymore. Except of course today, because a reminder popped up an told me ""Four years smoke free today"".

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of quitting had been in my mind for a while. Not because my partner wanted me to quit, or because I thought cigarettes were getting too expensive. Not even because I worried that I could develop some nasty health issues when I got older.

&amp;#x200B;

I quit because I wanted to be free of my addiction. And, more specifically: I wanted to be able to sit through an entire movie on Netflix without having to pause for a smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Before**

I would always worry if I had enough cigarettes with me. If the shops were still open. If I could smoke at place X. I used to think in smoke breaks, as I'm sure many of you can relate to. Five minutes before a meeting? Time for a cigarette. Commercials on tv? Smoke time. A short walk to a bus stop? Smoke time. I didn't want to admit it, but smoking cigarettes dominated my entire schedule. It did so sneakily, but it did so nonetheless. If I spent two hours or more in a museum, I wanted to get outside and smoke. I didn't necessarily want to leave, but my addiction was demanding my attention. I couldn't concentrate on the beautiful art before me, I was only thinking ""when can I smoke?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**During withdrawal**

Did you know that people who quit smoking are often fighting more than one fight? Of course you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You fight the withdrawal symptoms.

2. You fight the desire to smoke. 

3. For some, fighting against overeating as a substitute.

4. You struggle as your brain re-adjusts itself to a life without cigarettes (the habitual part, the part where you don't know what to do with your hands).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a big difference between wanting to quit and being told to quit (either by a person or a situation): I wanted to quit, so I didn't have to fight the desire to smoke. I knew for a fact that I never wanted to light up a cigarette ever again. A switch had flipped in my brain as clearly as if a light turned on in a room.

Now, that did not make the withdrawal symptoms any less bad. The nicotine receptors in my brain were as loud as they always were. The thing that made it easier is that I was able to look beyond the initial withdrawal and focus on the ""after"". Withdrawal doesn't last forever. it's a very real, chemical process in your brain. The nicotine receptors shrink after a while and you won't crave cigarettes anymore. After that, there is a calmer, clearer mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of thinking ""I can't smoke anymore"", I thought ""I've quit smoking. I am experiencing these withdrawal symptoms. I feel like sh\*t but I know this won't last forever. After this is over, I will be free.""

&amp;#x200B;

I would write it down whenever I was wide awake at 3AM, restless, irritated, antsy, grinding my teeth and unable to stay still. In fact, I wrote a lot in the deep dark hours of the night, mostly just describing my feelings or record the time as it passed by. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**After**

First and foremost: I am not a saint. Quitting smoking didn't miraculously heal all my problems and there are many things I struggle with (I got 99 problems but a smoke ain't one). I am not the person who is going to tell you that you will feel amazing and fantastic and reborn. No - you will feel... normal. I feel normal. And it's the best kind of normal I can imagine, because smoking made me feel like a pariah. I can exit any building I have been in for however many minutes and not reach for my cigarettes the moment I walk out. I can make my coffee in the morning and snuggle up on the couch while looking at the downpour and not stand in it, shivering, with coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I don't count in cigarettes anymore. A meeting is now not in one cigarette, but in five minutes. I am no longer constantly thinking about it, being inconvenienced by it, distracted by it, controlled by it. I can spend hours in a museum and be amazed and fully focused on the beauty I see. I can go to the cinema and stay in my seat during the break. I feel normal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion**

I encourage everyone to go and feel super normal. I know everyone's situation is different and I am not here to tell you one method is wrong and the other is right. I just want to shine some light on your motivation to quit smoking. Because if the motivation comes from within you, if you are the one who decides, you can do it. The fight won't be as difficult. And it will 100% be worth it to just not have to think about those stupid cigarettes anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I chose a time in my life where I felt I wasn't under high stress and things were going relatively well. No exams, no lousy job, I had just moved out on my own, so I had the mental capacity to deal with the emotions. So my advice will be: **quitting is good, but quitting when you're ready is better**.",stopsmoking
"I quit for 4 years, but now I‚Äôm back smoking a pack a day for a month now. I will try to quit again starting today. Wish me luck!",stopsmoking
"1. Smoking makes no sense at all

It is unhelathy, it is expensive, it makes you stink. Why would anyone want to smoke, at all?

2. It is stressful

When you're a smoker, you always have to worry about having a lighter, lighting up, cigarette butts, ash, emptying ashtrays, buying a pack, having a pack, opening windows during winter when your room stinks, and it's all really - a lot. Once you quit it's all gone.

3. No smoking lifestyle - is a healthy lifestyle

Once you quit smoking, you start to take care of  your body as well. You develop a healthy mindset. For example, I started to take a lot more vitamins than I used to, and drink a lot more teas. You simply choose what's good for you.

4. It's an achievement

If you're a smoker who quit smoking, you feel proud of yourself. Like, I really did that? I managed to quit an addiction? And you just feel better about yourself. It's an huge ego boost, and you start to see yourself as someone who is capable of anything.

5. You're calmer

I was scared to quit smoking before, because I thought ''What if I get even more angry and stressed without cigarettes?'' Well, I was wrong. I feel a lot calmer 3 weeks smoke free, than before. Turns out, it was cigarettes that made me so stressed.",stopsmoking
"Hey everyone,

I'm going to give an account of my journey from smoking, to changing over to vaping, to quitting fully now, just to say thanks for helping me quit smoking more than anything else ever did, and probably saving my life in the process. Hopefully this can give inspiration to others that want to quit and will give ideas on the methods I used that may work for someone else.

I'll start when I was 18, in 2009/2010 and started smoking. My first pack was Marlboro menthol 100s. the funny feeling of getting dizzy from smoking and thinking it was kind of cool continued for a bit until I was fully addicted and couldn't stop, nor did I really want to. I remember thinking after a few years that I wish I had never started, as the person that got me into smoking had quit, most of my friends that smoked had quit or at least only smoked when partying, etc. and here I was smoking all time and couldn't stop. Well at least I never bought cartons right? That was the point that would mean I was smoking too much, at least that's what I rationalized in my head.

For years this went on, switching from Marlboro Menthols, to Camel Filters, to Camel Crush, to Camel Crush Bold, then when they were banned I went to Camel Menthols. At this point it had been 7 years since I started smoking. I had quit about 4 or 5 years into smoking for about 4 months but I said to myself one day that i could just have a couple when drinking, which progressed right back to full on smoking habit. I was kicking myself because it was so miserable to quit cold turkey like i had and now I'd have to go through it again if i was going to quit again, which I thought I might never. I had started buying cartons maybe a year or 2 before the seven year mark, something i never wanted to do. Every paycheck I would buy a carton plus 4 packs, as I was smoking close to a pack a day. I had tried vaping before this point, with the little pen vapes that weren't very good or didn't last very long on battery. I could never figure out how to get the lung hit that I needed and got whenever smoking a cigarette, so I never stuck with the vaping. If i was just going to feel like i was breathing flavored air then what was the point? Like I said this was towards the beginning of when vaping was becoming a thing, I tried to be one of the earliest adopters but it didn't work for me.

At around 7 years I was starting to wake up and not be able to take full breaths until like 5 or 10 minutes after waking up. My lungs were hurting every morning and I knew my smoking days had to come to an end as this was definitely not good. It legitimately scared me feeling like that every couple mornings for about 6 months. That's when a coworker at the time, who i would smoke with on smoke breaks, got big into vaping. I mean, went off the deep end on all the tech, different tanks and atomizers, making his own coils, all that kind of stuff. This was also right at the beginning of box mods becoming popular, so that was a plus for me, since the pen batteries only had maybe a 5 hour battery life for me and wouldn't get me all the way through work. He started showing me a bunch of this stuff and I headed to a vape shop with him to see all the different things i could try after trying his tank and box mod setup, that made a lot more vapor than the pens too.

In the end I ended up picking up a Sigelei 100w box mod [https://imgur.com/a/vAwFKeo](https://imgur.com/a/vAwFKeo) and a Kanger subtank [https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL](https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL) . I was originally using 18 or 12 mg nicotine juice and paid attention while smoking cigs to see what it felt like with air flow, lung hit feel, etc. I found that cutting the airflow almost completely off, to where it felt like i was dragging on a cig, and having the high nicotine content and a dual coil at 60w to give the harsh lung hit, was exactly what I was looking for. I was smoking and vaping for months, still holding onto the cigs, until I noticed one day that I was picking the vape over the cigs more and more often because it tasted better, and specifically remember being at work on a smoke break and smoking a quarter of a cig and throwing it out. I thought at that point ""why are you still smoking these things, you're throwing most of it away, it is a waste of money now."" That is when I went on to vape completely. I believe this was 2016. 

The years go by, still only vaping, still using 12mg as 18 was kind of phased out of use in the whole industry it seemed, and was satisfied. Whenever i had a cig at a party or something every 6 months or so, it would taste terrible, and I'd toss it after only a few puffs. I had the Sigelei 150w temperature control [https://imgur.com/a/Be7b8cq](https://imgur.com/a/Be7b8cq) by then, still the same Kanger tank [https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL](https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL) with the dual coils, not using the temperature function at all, just the same 60w as usual. I remember other vapers commenting they couldn't believe i still had that setup still, like it was an antique or something haha! 

Well around the end 2019 I believe, I could not find coils for the tank anymore and the box mod was pretty beat up too, so I went to the local bigger vape shop and asked about what was good nowadays as I never took it on as a hobby and had no idea what kind of tech was out there now for box mods and tanks. The guy behind the counter was using a Voopoo Drag 2 [https://imgur.com/a/8Qp8xzZ](https://imgur.com/a/8Qp8xzZ) and a Freemax Mesh Pro tank [https://imgur.com/a/xg06AuG](https://imgur.com/a/xg06AuG) . I bought those for my new setup and was happy with it. The mesh helped get an instant hit like if you were hitting a cig, plus setting it up the same way with the airflow almost closed off got that cig feel and i was good to go. I was a little worried i'd lose that feel with a new setup and go back to smoking.

So now we get to the end of 2020. Keep in mind that I had been ordering my coils and juice online for years from giantvapes and hadn't had to deal with the hassle of going to a store for anything other than that new setup. Here comes Trump's dumbass vape mail ban, I couldn't believe it. I bought what I could until I couldn't order anymore and hoped to see how that would hold me, but I knew the end of vaping was coming for me. I wasn't going to pay double the price for stuff in a physical store. That ended up not being the case but i was sure it would be that way, as it used to be 23$ for a 30ml bottle back in the day from a store, and half that online (This shows you how long it had been since i had gone into a physical store lol).

I finished my last bit of 12mg after a couple months and decided to try to start to ween myself off nicotine if i could. This never worked before with cigs and I always had the experience of not getting the lung hit with lesser nicotine juice, but i thought i would try it. So I dropped to 6mg, and i was shocked to find it still had a lung hit. Maybe not as hard but I was used to it after a few days and I was good to go. After I ran out of 6mg a couple months later, I dropped to 3mg for a couple months, with the same effect, got used to the hit after a couple days and it was fine. This whole time I had not craved for more nicotine, nor was I vaping any more than I used to, which was a pleasant surprise, even though I pretty much vaped constantly anyways.

Now we get to about 2 months ago. I was taking the last big step and buying 0mg nicotine juice after not being without nicotine for about 12 years. I guess because i had stepped down to 3mg and was still able to vape to satisfy the habit/mental part of it, i had nearly NO WITHDRAWALS! It was amazing, the only affect i had was a little irritation and foggy headedness the first day but after that it was like nothing happened, I didn't crave it because I was still vaping, so it was nothing like when i quit cold turkey. The only issue was that now, with 0mg nicotine, it really did feel like there was no lung hit anymore, like i was just breathing flavored air again, and I worried about going back to the nicotine juice again and getting dependent on nicotine again. I just puffed harder to get what little lung hit 0mg has and I kicked the nicotine.

Now we're to about a week ago, and not getting the lung hit is starting to annoy me. I had the realization that I'm not enjoying this anymore as I'm expecting to get that lung hit and getting disappointed every time I vape, once again the ""flavored air, what's the point"" thing. So I said screw it and dropped it all together. I have taken a couple puffs since a week ago but that is it, I've pretty much quit altogether. 

I never thought I would quit vaping, as it is safe and I enjoy the act of smoking so why would I quit? Well the mail ban and not wanting to be addicted to something anymore has finally made it a pain in the ass enough where i'm done with it. No more sneaking puffs indoors somewhere because it's not allowed there. No more going outside in the rain or freezing cold or sweltering heat at work to get puffs because i NEED it. No more making a nasty film on the inside of the glass in my car because the vape condenses on them and it's a bitch to clean off. No more dreading flying on a plane because from the time you get into the airport until the time you're out of your destination airport, there's basically nowhere to vape/smoke and I vaped/smoked like a chimney. And no more coughing in the morning, even though vaping is safe it would still condense on the inside of my lungs and make me cough some in the morning and throughout the day.

My entire adult life I've needed nicotine to make it by, always having to plan ahead to make sure I had enough cigs or juice to make it through to when i could buy more, or being broke in my early adult years and spending money on cigs rather than food because I couldn't be without it. I keep looking over to grab my vape and walk outside out of habit, then I remember I dont need that anymore, it's not even with me. I have literally stood up at work, and paced around the office, thinking it felt weird that I hadn't gone outside for a vape yet. It's like it's all totally new for me, I haven't not done these things since I was in high school, and it feels great!

Anyways, the point to all this is just to share with people that understand what I went through, as most of us have to some degree had a similar story I think and to share a story that may help more of you make that transition from smoking to vaping, using the way i set up the vape to make it feel like a cigarette, or from vaping to fully quitting if you choose. I was on 12mg nicotine for god's sake, most vapers couldn't even hit my vape because it would give them coughing fits from how strong it was. If I can do it you definitely can, cliche I know, but try it out the way I did and it may work for you. Those of you that are continuing to vape, no shade thrown towards you either. If it wasn't banned from getting supplies mailed to me, I'd probably still be vaping, and I definitely loved having a way to ""smoke"" without risking cancer, stinking of cig smoke, etc. I'm thankful that vaping got me off cigs which I don't think I could've done myself, and it pisses me off to no end that it is demonized when it has saved so many lives, myself included. It didn't matter that I saw my great uncle without a nose because he had to have it removed because of smoking. It didn't matter seeing those commercials with the guy with the hole in his throat, or any of that stuff. Vaping was finally the thing that worked, and after all these years I can say I'm free, to join the people I started smoking with all those years ago that quit as well. 

Thanks for all the help over the years on this subreddit and encouragement, I wish you all the best, and with any luck, this will by my last goodbye to this sub. Be excellent to each other!

PS: Don't look at my number of days that I have been quit on this sub, that was set when I quit cold turkey the first time, you can see how long ago that was. Took me until now to be able to do it again, but dammit i'm doing it. Never again going back to it.",stopsmoking

Whenever that happens, I have my anti-smoking 'prescription' ready:

‚óºI meditate for a couple of minutes and observe how irrational all these thoughts are: All caused from a sick addiction.

"I've been having a few drinks with the family, smoking as usual. Thought it would be fun get the camcorder out the attic because who doesn't love clingy moments from the early 2000s!

We have supposedly already seen every single video possible yet I find one labeled name and name. So I think cool that'll be funny and pop it on.

Fast forward through cringy ass singing at age 12 we stumble upon unseen footage of life how it used to be, I was 13 smoking, swearing and trying to live up to the people around me.

I was sat at the kitchen dining table holding a role up in each hand and smoking both.

It was at this point I realised as an adult (28) that I was disgusted with myself, I was a child back then and I should of had better parental care but I know my mum had just came out of a really bad domestic violence relationship so I kinda don't blame her for being so withdrawn, I mean I don't know personally what that is like to be beat up for years.

I have two kids and I've stopped smoking various times, of course whilst pregnant, months after having my kids I'd pick the habit up whilst stressed, then I quit again and the cycle would continue.

I watched that video as a parent and thought to myself I'd that was my kid this would NOT be happening!

So it's now 4.08am when I wake up a little later I'm banging a patch on and going for it, that home video has been the ultimate wake up call for me because of the different levels of disgust I feel.

However, as much as I obviously don‚Äôt wanna smoke ever again, there‚Äôs a part of me that wants to do nothing more than go smoke. I still feel like I‚Äôm giving something up. If anybody has felt similar after using the Allen Carr method, how have you gotten past this?

I started with cigarettes at 18 smoked those until a year ago when I was 20 then started smoking puff bars/ Hyde bars. I finally decided to quit a month ago. I was tired of the occasional waking up not being able to breathe and needing to use my inhaler everyday. 

Recently I have had to use my inhaler everyday multiple times and I wake up frequently in the middle of the night coughing. My cough is mostly dry but I can feel the congestion in my lungs. I feel like my inhaler really doesn‚Äôt work have the time and my doctor has said it‚Äôs normal it‚Äôs just my lungs trying to break down the damage and get it out so my lungs can heal.

"For the last ten years or so, I've been noticing my hair thinning.
(BTW, I am female).  Sometimes during a shower and washing my hair, I would literally have to use my foot to push the hair off the drain for the water to flow out.

I blamed it on some medication I was taking, and since doctors are supposed to report side-effects of prescribed medications, I even insisted that he report it to the manufacturer.

About a week ago, there has been much less hair in the drain.  This morning, I noticed practically none.  I was perplexed.  I'm still taking the medication.  Why the sudden turnaround?  What am I doing differently?

And then it occurred to me, the only thing I'm doing differently, is NOT SMOKING.

What do you guys think?  I know we get more blood supply to all our cells and consequently more oxygen too, when we quit, but damn!  It never crossed my mind that it could be cigarettes.

There is good news too: I am AWARE of all of this. I am observing the craziness that addiction can cause and I am not reacting to anything (except that I breathe, heavily, between cravings).

"Hi everybody, 

I hope you're all doing well. Today marks the 6th day without smoking cigarettes for me. This is the longest I've been in over 1 year and 10 months! I'm 22y old and university student.

This is going to be a long post and I'm sorry in advance.

I'd been a smoker for 2 years but with a ''vacation off cigarettes'' for couple of months where I would smoke one or two here and there but that was it. Throughout my smoking ''career'' I was increasing how much I smoke during the day throughout those 2 years. In the end I would smoke 1 pack and sometimes even 1 and a half or maybe 2 when I was stressed. I realize that 2 years may seem like nothing but believe me, I was a smoker like anyone else with a longer cigarette smoking history behind. My day was built around cancer sticks, they were the first thing for me in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. I would go freezing myself on the balcony in the winter to smoke and I would go in the middle of the night to buy a pack on the machine because tobacco shops didn't work at 12am. This was all just a sign that I was ADDICTED TO A DRUG. Being addicted isn't fun at all. Problem is that some smokers don't even want to accept the fact that they are addicted, they think they like smoking, but that's just a trick their brain is playing on them.

I quit with the help of 25mg Nicorette patch.Without it I would have never quit. I just don't have that strong of a willpower to quit without NRT. I've tired gum and lozenges but I threw up because of the taste and how much I just didn't like them so I decided to get the patches.

The biggest thing I noticed is how much more free time I have now. I can finally dedicate myself to playing video games that I really love and not playing for 1 hour and then craving for a cigarette. I can drink coffee and actually spend time with it, talking to persons around me and not craving for anything. I'll buy a book to read in my free time as well and I'll study more to finish the last couple of exams I have left to graduate.

My biggest motivators to quit were my financial situation, I truly believe that every person should be a better human being to himself/herself and to his family and people who he or she loves. I didn't want my mom and gran to spend money to buy me cigarettes and not have enough for other things... I also wanted to do things I love like gaming and reading and watching things without constantly being bothered for a smoke. I also didn't want to be anxious when I don't have enough cigarettes for the day. And many other things.

I plan to gradually reduce the strenght of the patches within the next few weeks and finally get off them as well. I always take them off before going to sleep and I don't have any issues. During the first few days with the patches I noticed that my skin where the patch is would itch but that would pass within few minutes so not that big of a deal.

I encourage all to quit, using any method you may need or you may find suitable. My psychatrist told me not to quit cold turkey so I didn't and I couldn't have done it that way.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my story and hold myself accountable. 

P.S. I still think about smoking and romanticize it but I hope I don't cave in. All the best to all!!!",stopsmoking

"I'm 17, smoke about 3-5 cigarettes a day and have done so for the last 9 months. I'm capable of not smoking any for 5-10 days and I do so regularly to kind of keep a bit of control. It's really easy for me to not smoke on normal days but if there's a party or I'm going to a club I really have trouble. Like atleast half the people there smoke and when I'm drunk I obviously think less clearly. I also enjoy the smoking in those situations cause it gives me a chance to go outside for a bit and think for a minute. When I'm going out I usually smoke about 10 a night. Any advice?",stopsmoking
"I‚Äôve been a smoker for 20 years and some, 15 to 20 cigarettes a day. I‚Äôve tried quitting 10+ times : cold turkey, vaping, patches and nicotine candies. The longest I went without smoking were 4 and 7 months, using a vape.

I‚Äôm currently 8 months pregnant, down to 6 to 10 cigarettes a day and desperate about ever quitting. I‚Äôm in a very poor mental state due to the guilt and worry of smoking while pregnant, and perpetual anxiety because of the stigma, even though you‚Äôd guess I‚Äôm trying to hide it.

I‚Äôve been actively trying to stop since I got pregnant but with no success. I couldn‚Äôt get past 24h so far. I‚Äôve seen a midwife that specializes in addiction and got prescribed patches and candies, but they‚Äôre the lowest possible dosage and don‚Äôt really bring down the urges beside a psychological effect. I hate the candies too and will switch to gums on my next try.

At this point I kind of gave up on the pregnancy motivator since I‚Äôve been smoking for the past full 7 months... but I can‚Äôt stomach that I‚Äôll still be smoking when my baby is born. This is disheartening to me. I don‚Äôt give up on trying, but I need to plan my next attempt so that I‚Äôm not immediately overwhelmed by the cravings.

I can manage to avoid the cigarettes that I usually smoke ‚Äúthroughout the day‚Äù, but some are so deeply rooted in my habits and routines that I‚Äôve the hardest time to fight back. The first cigarette of the morning, that I have with  coffee after breakfast, is a big one. Then the one after lunch. Then the one after dinner.

Then I get the worst cravings in the evening, and especially after I‚Äôve put my son to bed and I‚Äôm able to lay back and relax. My husband is a heavy smoker too, and this is usually a time when we sit in the garden and chat and smoke. I easily smoke half a day worth of cigarettes there in one sitting, over a couple hours before going to bed. The association between that moment and smoking is so strong I don‚Äôt know how to fight it. This is where all previous attempts have failed.

I take any advice to help me change things around and support my efforts.",stopsmoking

"As per usual, I spent an evening in the dorm kitchen with my flatmates/friends. It's been unusually quiet since only 3 of us stayed in the flat. This level of, let me say, intimacy provides a chance to talk more openly. We also grabbed a beer. These two occurrences are among my worst smoking triggers. Now, I thought I'd be good to go and resistant to cravings. However, at some point of our conversation I found myself saying ""I'm gonna regret it but fuck it, let's grab a cig"". It was met with a stern no from my friends and a bit of asking why I'd need to smoke. While my urge remained, I avoided smoking. 

What's really surprising is the fact that they were actually supportive. Now, I don't really want any support, someone pitying me or whatever, but it felt unusual in a pleasant way. Definitely unlike things I would expect.

"This may have already been discussed, sorry. I found out but accident that nicotine patches work pretty well for more than one day.

I have no scientific evidence behind this, it's just my experience. Heck, it may be pure placebo effect. But I'm now about a month in using 21mg patches for two days each and I am craving free.

 Today I am 28 days smoke free and still going strong!

First 3 days were pretty tough, I had mild tremors and double vision accompanied by somewhat bearable headaches that would come and go throughout the day. Of course agitation was high on the list with my anxiety also being particularly problematic. This was soon followed by excessive mucus down the nasal passage which I did my best to spit out when I was able to but when I wasn't able to, it contributed to congestion and inflammation in the chest, which ultimately felt similar to a chest cold. For that I bought an over the counter bronchodilator syrup which was a great relief and helped get rid of the congestion pretty quickly. A big bowl of chicken soup also helps heaps.

By the end of my first week, I started bloating quite a bit and experienced gastro symptoms, passing larger and more frequent stools. This lasted for the following two weeks and I did make a point of not falling prey to eating more. To help with the stomach issues I started eating cleaner, more veg and probiotics which seemed to settle the stomach issues and the bloating subsided completely after two weeks. 

The purpose of this post is to help others who are either wanting to quit smoking to understand what they COULD experience or those who have recently quit make sense of their symptoms/side effects. We won't all experience the same symptoms/side effects but I think it is worth a shot to share our post quitting experiences because the internet is not always a great help.

"Hi Reddit! 

Yeah, I know. Tough title but It's true though (I can't believe I found the courage to write these words!): I am gradually turning into a chain smoker. I started to smoke when I was 14-15 years old (currently 29m) and it came a point that I smoked, regularly, 35-40 cigarettes' a day. Yesterday I made the BIG decision: Enough is enough.

In the last 5-6 years I have made a lot of tough decisions and changes (for the better) and I really am a different person: Very confident relatively successful and clear on what I want in life (after many years of suffering from severe anxiety and low self-esteem). Now, It's time for another important step: Letting go of smoking and start focusing on a brighter and healthier future. 

I have already made a mini-plan on how to cope with cravings and how to motivate myself during the tough moments: This community, is part of it!

I don‚Äôt know if/when I‚Äôll have another cigarette, but I‚Äôm not a smoker. Saying you‚Äôre a smoker puts a label on yourself. It‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy. If you say you are a smoker, then you‚Äôll smoke. If you say you‚Äôre not a smoker, then you‚Äôre not one. You might smoke again, but you‚Äôre not a smoker. 

Don‚Äôt label yourself something you don‚Äôt want to be. If you give yourself that label, you‚Äôll feel an obligation to fulfill that label. 

If you stop calling yourself a smoker, maybe one day you‚Äôll decide you‚Äôre tired of doing it, and you‚Äôll stop. 

TL;DR don‚Äôt label yourself as a smoker",stopsmoking

"I started smoking when I was 15 (22 now) after like one or two years I was on pack a day. It was too much money for me so I started to buy tobacco to roll which is a little cheaper and more tasty option in my country. But man... at one point I was able to smoke the whole tobacco pack in a day which is i think 25g thats like 25 cigs a day. Basicly i had that fucking thing in my mouth all day. Arround 19 yo I started to feel the negative impact (big trouble with breathing, headaches, insomnia, occasionall heart disrythmia which scares me the most, weird pressure etc) I went from smoking to nicotine pouches and I started to feel much better after couple of days but now it is back for like half a year so I want to quit for good. 

At one point because I am working on a ship. I wasnt able to buy new pouches for cca 14 days. So I was just using the used ones all the time which turned out to have a very good placebo effect. The 14th day I realised that I dont feel any cravings anymore. Unfortunately I didnt plan to quit at that time so I didnt grab that oportunity and bought a new ones and basically started again. Fucking idiot !

But what came to my mind now is that. Because Im addicted to it so hard that when I tried cold turkey it just didnt seem possible. Maybe its a good idea to try this placebo strategy.

The issue is my spouse. He's a pack and a half a day smoker and couldn't be the least bit supportive. In fact, at the last slip up, his best friend reprimanded me for giving in while my husband laughed and handed me another. 

My husband has no desire to ever quit; he works in construction and claims it would be too hard. 

But even when I beg him not to go smoke after his nightly shower, he does anyway.

"Hey guys! So I'm about 4-5 weeks into my quit. I used hypnotherapy and it was very helpful. I have started running which is a pure joy for me, it's producing some great chemicals. I feel like my body is well adjusted now, and yet- I do also have some pretty intense stressors in my life. I also love to consume media in the form of movies - and there is A LOT OF SMOKING shown in these films/shows. So after not having any cravings for the first two-three weeks, now I'm kinda seeing them resurface. I also have work + family (general life) stress.... and I'm just still hanging on for dear life, you know? I guess I'm surprised to find that the cravings can still surface after this length of time, because after the hypnotherapy I felt so solid in my decision. I even somewhat became nauseous at the thought of it..... which like - yes it is nausea inducing, it's quite sickening really.

So I went to work this morning and was feeling pretty grumpy. I had a meeting first thing which I knew was going to be stressful even if I wasn't quitting. It was with some colleagues and my boss, who let's just say I find challenging even when I'm not in nicotine withdrawal. So halfway through the meeting she said something pretty rude to me, which I'm used to and just try to ignore because she's my boss after all. Well instead, today I replied to her: ""EXCUSE ME?!!!""

My heart was pounding. Everyone's jaw dropped. I was panicking. What did I just do?!! Seconds passed. Then she apologized. Twice. And pulled me aside later to apologize some more.

I lucked out here. I wasn't really in control of that situation and it easily could have gone another way. But I have to say I felt like a million bucks hearing her apologize to me over and over. Anyway, just thought I'd share. Thanks again for all your support everyone!",stopsmoking
"Today is Day 14 for me! (And a very proud Day 7 for my husband!)

Things are getting easier. There have been a couple days this week that I've managed to go 4-6 hours without thinking about a smoke instead of fighting a craving every hour. The cravings are weaker and easier to distract myself from. 

I'm still struggling some with sleep. I've been feeling kind of zombie-ish the last week. Tired and bloated and like I've got a bit of a head cold. My anxiety and agitation are both on the intense side but my mood swings are calming down.

Mostly it just feels good though. Every crappy day has still been better than a day spent smoking. 

I particularly am coming to love:

* Not feeling like I have to smoke before I can go anywhere/do anything. I've mentioned this a few times on here but oh my god it's so annoying how everrryyyythingggggg starts being structured around cigarettes. And it makes anything you need to do feel like a massive chore. Even simple stuff. ""Ugh, gotta go CHECK THE MAILBOX. Guess I'll have a cig first. And one after."" Like what??? Just walk thirty feet and grab the mail it's not a hardship that you need cigarettes to get through üòÜ

* Not having to shower every time I leave the house to avoid smelling too much like smoke. Now I don't smell like smoke because I don't smoke anymore. That's pretty great.

* Not feeling like a loser every time my bonus kid is over and I miss time with them to step out on the porch and get my fix. Or feeling like a loser when they come outside with me to spend time and have to breathe my secondhand smoke. I don't wanna do that to my kid. 

* Looking healthier in general. My teeth already look so much better??? I don't know how that's possible in 2 weeks but they already look brighter. So do my eyes. My skin is a pimply mess right now but I know that'll go away too in a week or so. 

* Feeling healthier in general. Deep breaths come more easily and I haven't noticed my heart racing/pounding as often. My stamina is already starting to improve a bit and I feel less winded during activities. 

I'm sure there are other positives I haven't mentioned, but these are the big ones for me right now. And I know they'll only get better as time goes.",stopsmoking

"I've been smoking consistently now for around 2 years. I've been taking steps to quit for a few months now, and it's been going better recently. I was up to smoking about 8-12 cigarettes a day. That may not seem like a lot to some, but it started feeling like a lot to me, which I wonder if body size has anything to do with. (I'm about 120 lbs and 5'4""). The minimum I've been able to get to per day has been about 4 cigarettes, and the maximum number of days I seem to be able to reach without smoking at all has been 2, over the last few months. During the days I am not smoking, I've basically learned to expect having lots of really, really depressed feelings. I don't seem to have any other withdrawal symptoms that I notice, but it's really tough to go through the constant struggle to not have racing thoughts and depression. 

I'd love to be able to get on meds for the depression, but I cannot afford them. I think they would help a lot, so it's something I may try to prioritize more. I am also in counseling and quitting smoking has been an ongoing topic with my therapist, but honestly, it hasn't helped. I feel that it only makes me feel more guilty, and it loads on more stress because I feel more pressured to quit for someone else. Not for me. 

I think my main problem is that I don't enjoy life in general, so I don't see a way that life would necessarily get better without smoking, only that I wouldn't have to live with the fears and other things that accompany smoking. Hopefully this subreddit will be an encouragement to me.",stopsmoking
"Hey r/stopsmoking,

yesterday I (26) was at the pulmologist with my mother (60) and as expected she got bad news. 
She's smoking since her youth and the effects are getting bigger. I wasn't shocked when the doctor told her she has COPD. 
Her lung is wounded and she can't walk like 50 meters without almost passing out. 
The disappointing part is, that she is not able to stop smoking.
It's a topic we had for years. Part of why I stopped smoking half a year ago after 10 years was to be an example for her.
But she blocks every way I try to help her. 
My next try will be like a Presentation for her. I will show her in detail, but as easy as I can what COPD is and what a difference it would make to stop smoking. She really has her problems to understand the topic and I want to give her the chance to understand it. If she still don't want to stop smoking then, I will atleast have tried my best. I have to tell you, it's not easy to see your own mother slowly dying. That's why I won't ever give up fighting for her life.

I encourage everybody to try to stop smoking. I don't want to mention the bad effects of smoking, but I want you to see the chances of stopping.
I stopped 7 month 4 days and 15 hours ago and I don't regret it. 
It's the first time I had a success in my life where I am proud of every day that I reached it. I am more into sports since I stopped. I soon stopped coughing and now I only cough like ""normal"" people. I don't have the bad smell and I save alot of money.
The biggest point is that I enjoy to breathe now. 

Non-smoking has only benefits. I had some hard moments since I quit but I never needed a cigarette because I knew that it will cause problems than solving them. 
Nobody's perfect and I didn't succeed in my first try, but this time, although I'm an absolute pessimist, I'm safe to say that I'll never smoke again.
By the way. Think about your loved ones. I always hated it when friends said that I should stop smoking. But they just had the need to tell me this because the didn't want me to die early.

I hope this post can help. For me it was a help to write down my thoughts.",stopsmoking

"I had a realization tonight. I've listened to the recording of Allen Carr's book *Easy Way to Stop Smoking* at least a dozen times now, and although the idea usually sticks for a while - I've ""cracked"" and smoked each time. And it's always a bummer!

Anyway. I read a comment on here once which said something along the lines of ""I'm a nonsmoker now. I don't smoke. I don't want to smoke. **If a meteor were headed for Earth to kill us all, I still wouldn't smoke.**"" And that last line always stuck with me!

I mean - if *a god damn meteor* were about to *kill us all*.... fuck it, right? Smoke up! 

And despite listening to that damn book over and over to make sure I fully understood every point and counter-argument to the shit my brain would come up with to justify smoking... I still never could get over that meteor thing. Because deep down I still believed it was actually an enjoyable experience to smoke and relieve my nicotine withdrawals. Which basically meant I'd never really gotten the point of that damn book lol.

I don't want to smoke. I don't ever want to smoke again. And I'm pretty I never wanted to smoke in the first place - except for those first few experimental times. What I want is to *not* want to smoke. Does that make sense? And for most of my life, the only way to get rid of that craving/urge to smoke was to just smoke. Yet the sick joke is that smoking is what perpetuates the eternal hell of always wanting to smoke. 

I don't want to smoke. I want to not want to smoke, and I do that by not smoking. Every time I think I want a cigarette - I realize ""no. I don't want a cigarette, I am having a trigger/craving/urge to do what I've always done. But that has not worked, and it will not ever work. I want to be free of this hellish nightmare of suffering feelings of withdrawal followed by feeling guilty for caving in."" And I do that by not smoking. And every day the nicotine leaves my body a bit more, and every day I train myself to react to triggers by not wanting to pursue that damned strategy I fooled myself into relying on.

And to that end - it's a relief to realize that as long as I've got my head screwed on right, I won't ever fall for the trick again. Not tomorrow and not next year, because if I plan on smoking again one day - to throw out all logic and self-preservation for a phantom of relief - then I might as well do it this very moment. Logical fallacies have a way of immediately collapsing the entire framework like that. I get it now. I don't want to smoke. I never want to smoke. Gun to my head, meteor headed right for the Earth, that sucks... but suggesting I smoke a cigarette is just as dumb of an idea as suggesting I shoot up heroin or bash my toe with hammer.",stopsmoking

"I started smoking in college while I was also working a weekend job. My work had a lot of down time so almost everyone in the warehouse would sit around chain smoking. They would smoke in the trucks and at our delivery sites. Eventually it became too tempting and to relieve stress from work and school I began smoking as well.

At first it was just cigarillos. I would smoke one in the morning before class. They used to sell flavored cigarillos which made it easier to get into. Then one day I ran out, so I bummed a smoke from someone on campus. I realized they weren't as bad I thought they would be, and they were cheaper, so I started buying those instead.

Then it turned into a social thing. Hanging out with the other guys between class at the smoke pit and shooting the shit. Smoking in a circle in the warehouse with the other guys at work before our next delivery. Some of my other friends had started smoking as well so I would smoke a lot at parties. One cigarillo in the morning turned into about 8-12 smokes a day.

I still lived at home and had to hide it from my parents. I'm not sure how they couldn't smell it when I came home but I managed to hide it. One time they found an empty pack in my car and called me out on it. I said I had smoked some but had quit already, which was a lie. Then I kept smoking in secret. I knew it was an addiction.

Eventually the guys in my class started switching to vapes. This was in the somewhat early days of vaping around 2015. I picked up a cheap vape and found it was actually pretty easy to switch from cigarettes to the vape. The vape tasted better and at the time juice was pretty cheap. It was easier to hide and I could vape inside (I never smoked inside or in my car).

The cheap vape turned into sub-ohm mods, DIY coil wrapping, and bigger and bigger bottles of juice. It got more and more expensive. I didn't do the math but it might have been more expensive than smoking. Occasionally I would go back to smokes when I ran out of juice, but could switch back to the vape pretty easily.

It came to a point where I knew I couldn't keep vaping. But quitting vaping was incredibly hard. I tried and failed a dozen times. Vaping was too easy and too convenient and I couldn't resist it.

I made a promise 2 years ago that I would stop vaping. I failed, but kept it a secret. I hid it from the person I promised it to. The second time I lied and hid my addiction from someone close to me. I feel an immense amount of guilt for hiding it for so long.

My last vape was 2 weeks ago, and while I have constant cravings I've resisted so far. I'm doing NRT right now and it's helping.

It feels weird to say, but I miss standing out in the rain having a lonely smoke. I hope that feeling goes away eventually.

"About 2 years ago my wife and I started daily smoking MJ and mixing in tobacco was common but not daily. Sometimes we did sometimes we didn‚Äôt. For the past almost 2 years I‚Äôve had monthly anxiety attacks that are crippling and just downright horrible. The process: I‚Äôd have a moment where I‚Äôd get this weird nervous aura followed by anxiety, a hot flash, shaking, sweats, and general confusion about my current situation. Everything would stop in under a minute, except the shaking and anxiety. The shaking would slow itself down after a while, but the crippling anxiety would last 3-4 days.

For a year and a half I thought I was having issues with depression and the fear of having another attack was almost just as bad. It happened every month almost to the day with a few times it skipping a month or being slightly later in the month but it was still consistent.

After multiple changes of diet and other daily routines and having no luck it finally hit me. I was mixing in way too much tobacco and having it way too often, and when I was having my attacks it was when I wasn‚Äôt having any tobacco at all. Basically withdrawal effects from not using. 

I‚Äôve quit tobacco for 2 months now, and while the recurring anxiety attacks have happened, they were much less in intensity and there was no physical lasting affects. Each month has gotten better. Anyone else with similar stories?",stopsmoking

I have no patience, i could fight anybody looking at med for too long at the street and i feel soo tired i dont know why. The urges of smoking a ciggarette keep popping up in my head every 15 min.
I just picture myself a life without ciggaretes and think to myself, why couldnt that be this life?
Also i need to safe money and i really really wanna get rid of the anxiety ciggarettes come with

As soon as the urges come i either eat alot of candy or i google up reasons why smoking is bad. I really dont care about dying, it honestly the opposit. I just dont want live my life with all this stress ciggarettes give me. 

I also draw tons of squares on a paper and now i have crossed 2 of them, having every 10th square withholding a prize like haircut or new pair of clothing.

I wish you look and i remember: ciggarettes doesnt kill your pain
It makes it worse

"I've been smoking for about 20 years (averaging between 8-12 sticks a day) and this is my fifth attempt at quitting.

Attempt 1 lasted 13 months, attempt 2 around 9 months. Attempts 3 and 4 weren't very impressive. in all those attempts, I began my first smoke-free day after chucking out all my cigarettes and lighters. and I ultimately relapsed.

what struck me now is that while I had successfully removed enablers in my previous attempts, i had never really worked on my own will power to deny the nicotine urge.

so, this time, I quit but with my ciggies all as it were on Sep 13th (when I smoked my last cigarette in this quit attempt). I still have an open pack of 8 cigarettes 3 meters away on the table - and, if I wanted to, I could light up within 3 seconds.

in my WFH desk I have six 10-packs lying unopened still (this was part of my routine: buy smokes over the weekend to last the entire coming week).

I still have back-up packs stashed everywhere (car, wardrobe, drawers, work laptop bag, desk in office, etc.). these were emergency packs in case I ran out in the course of normal life.

I still also have my other emergency they-may-announce-a-new-lockdown stash in my under-mattress storage - that's about another 10-12 packs, I guess?

all these ""riches"" are at arm's length and, while these 24 days have not been easy at all, denying that next cigarette has been simply so much more satisfying.

"This is going to be babble and I‚Äôll say that up front. My mom passed away recently from apparent lung cancer.   I just wanted to share the strange situation of when she quit. 

Mom had smoke 50 yrs!  I‚Äôd begged her to quit. I hid her cigarettes. I threw them away. I put a no smoking sign in the bathroom!  She cut back. By the end, she maybe smoked 1 a day. It was always when working. She said she needed it.   I think she thought that she was safe. She would never get her lungs checked though. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to know!‚Äù she‚Äôd say.  She started using a Breo inhaler about 3 years ago. That should‚Äôve been a sign to get checked but she wouldn‚Äôt.   In 2020, as COVID began, she quit. She said she started smoking and just didn‚Äôt want it anymore.   She never wanted to smoke after that. 

I read something online that quitting suddenly can be an indicator that something has changed in the body. Probably cancer.   She began to lose weight. A mass was found in July 2021. She passed away September 21.   I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this. Just wanted to share.  I hope everyone who is trying to quit is successful.

"Hi everyone!

Longtime lurker, but finally found the courage to post here. 

Guys, I need advice. I'm trying to quit smoking for around a year now, after I reduced it to ""only weekends"". Smoked around half a pack a day for \~10 years. 

I'm always doing fine for a few weeks until social gatherings happen. A lot of my friends are heavy smokers and I get jealous all the time just looking at them smoking. Usually there is also quite a lot alcohol involved but even if I don't drink, I can't do it. Most of the times I can fight the urge to smoke for around an hour or so, but then I give in. How do you deal with such situations? How can I break up this cigarette-alcohol-link in my brain?! 

Thanks in advance.",stopsmoking
"Been on the fence about quitting for a while. All the mental, physical and economical benefits of not smoking aside, there's something soothing about smoking that really calms me and I guess I'm a little afraid of letting that go. 

Been smoking for about 25 years and I really don't want to quit, but I decided that with the way the world is going, there's less and less space for smokers in it. Imagine being on holiday somewhere nice. You find a great looking cozy bar and they serve you a delicious cold beer, the sun is out and everything is perfect. You ask for an ashtray and are told that it's a non-smoking facility and you need to go behind that building on the other side of the street (without your drink) to have a cigarette. 

One of my reasons for wanting to quit this habit is to avoid the imagined scenario above. I remember when they banned indoor smoking in clubs/restaurants many years ago. I was furious at the time, but it only took a little while until it became the accepted norm. And now, even as a smoker, I would not like to see indoor smoking making a return. 

I decided to seek medical help to make the process easier on me. My doctor prescribed Champix, which is a 4-week treatment. I'm now on day 6, and much to my big surprise, it took over two hours this morning (even after a couple of cups of coffee) before I realized that I'd ""forgotten"" to smoke. The cravings simply weren't there as they use to be. It is advised to continue to smoke while taking the pills for the first half, as eventually smoking will induce nausea which will hopefully help with the psychological addiction. 

Why am I writing all of this? No idea. Guess I'm just trying to put some thoughts down somewhere and this felt like an appropriate place to do so.",stopsmoking

"I quit vaping in June. I smoked cigarettes for 5 years and then vaped for like 8 years. I've quit so many times, but this year it was for good. I read Alan Carr's How to Stop Smoking the Easy Way and haven't looked back. There are SO many benefits to being nicotine free that I've been learning about every since I quit. This one really takes the cake though.

I used to have really bad insomnia. Like, some nights I just wouldn't be able to fall asleep for hours. There were times I actually had to call out of work because it wasn't safe for me to drive on 2-3 hours of sleep. I experienced insomnia at least once a week, sometimes more. The doctor wouldn't prescribe sleeping medication and recommended I take melatonin or benadryl before bed; both of which did next to nothing for me. So I was just kind of SOL for a long time.

Two weeks after quitting nicotine, I stopped having trouble falling asleep every night. It's MAGICAL getting in the bed and just...falling asleep. I rarely have any issues falling asleep now. If I've had a stressful day, maybe it takes me 20 minutes to fall asleep instead of 10.

It's such a radical change in such a short amount of time. Has anyone else noticed big changes in their sleep too?",stopsmoking

For those of you who have quit and have experienced stress, what do you do instead of smoking?   I have things I do but that‚Äôs for normal stress 

I bought a pack of cigs and smoked 5 of them and then left it on the city bus along with my lighter.  I‚Äôm hoping it won‚Äôt take my body long to feel normal again.  It‚Äôs been a little less than a  week of smoking",stopsmoking

"10/1/20 was my quit day. 

Cravings stayed at 7-8 out of 10 for 6 months. Straight up. It finally got a little easier this summer. COVID helped since I‚Äôve basically stopped going to bars which is where I did a lot of smoking, but don‚Äôt get me wrong, I had plenty of cravings at home alone too. 

I was heavily dependent on throat lozenges for the first six months also.  (menthol ‚Äî the stronger the better. I needed something that burned). I was going through the 200ct family pack of Halls Sugar Free menthol a week. I still like one every now and then. But it‚Äôs more like one a day max, and usually just before bed. 

My grandma died last month. We were very closed‚Ä¶.she practically raised me. The temptation to light up was there. It was hard not to relapse. But even still, that craving was at about a 5-6 compared to what it was like during early 2021. So it does get better. But, I wouldn‚Äôt say ids ‚Äúeasy‚Äù yet. Because I still have to be vigilant. Not trying to discourage you just want you to be realistic.

Usually the next day or two I feel I might be slightly more irritated but I didn't fully cave.

Well, last weekend, my neighbor was randomly talking to me and invited me over for a couple beers. 3 in, he lights up a cig.. I was a piece of crap and asked for one and smoked it, bit drunk but no excuse.

Basically, I'm not completely powerless when I'm around an opportunity (definitely had like 5 + times where people were smoking and I did not try to ask for a cig.)

the problem is even a little bit of it, mixed into a weed bong, elevates it to heavenly level. The pleasant nicotine rush thats almost immediate connected with a slowly creeping in thc high is something I just can‚Äôt quit. I‚Äôm not interested in cigarettes if I don‚Äôt have weed and I couldn‚Äôt care less about weed without cigarettes but once I have both I do it compulsivly like a crackhead.

However last night I got really (like objectively ) drunk, possibly the first time since my quit day and asked a friend to give me a cig and he said no way and he was adamant about it when I insisted and I was mad but now I'm like THANK YOU DUDE.

I feel like a disaster's been averted. I can't believe I wanted a cigarette, I was so proud of myself for not feeling addicted anymore.  Today I  could have woken up to a horrible morning.

Everything changes always, when I'm trying to quit smoking. I don't know if it's some weird mind-body connections, or if my extensor muscles tighten (my physiotherapist said when I first came to visit that I have ultra tight extensors) but everytime I try to quit smoking my back pain come back.
Yesterday I thought it's good day to say goodbye to ciggarettes, and one or two hours later my back pain was back. I felt it till today morning, when I decided to give up and smoke (maybe na hour after smoking).

How can I not beat myself up over this? I literally feel like I have to be mad at myself until I quit again. I feel like smoking is just sending out bad energy into the universe. 

I could have a great day, be doing everything right, but I‚Äôll smoke and feel like it was all for nothing. 

How can I still be proud of my accomplishments and feel good about myself even if I haven‚Äôt kicked this yet? It‚Äôs almost like I feel obligated to feel guilty and miserable because I can‚Äôt stop yet. 

I want to quit, but beating myself up makes it even worse. All it does is make me smoke more. I feel like I‚Äôm justifying it though, and that makes me feel even more guilty.

Please tell me how you guys deal with the weight gain and food cravings? I‚Äôve only been quit a little over a month and I‚Äôve put on 15 pounds already! It‚Äôs kinda depressing because before I quit I lost some weight and was doing really good but now I‚Äôve completely fell off the train. Trying to convince myself that a little weight gain is better then the negative health effects of smoking but I‚Äôm already pretty overweight so either way it‚Äôs not good.

"I really don‚Äôt feel like celebrating as I don‚Äôt really feel like there‚Äôs anything good to say. It‚Äôs been almost two months since I quit smoking. I miss it so much. I haven‚Äôt felt good about myself since I quit. I have gained so much weight since I quit that it‚Äôs almost unbearable to look at myself anymore. My metabolism was quick as lighting and my appetite was microscopic when I was smoking. I had an awful relationship with food before quitting, and now it seems like I‚Äôve switched one addiction for another. 

I‚Äôve tried to diet, but it brings up some pervious eating disorder issues I had in the past. I get scared I‚Äôll fall down that hole again. I‚Äôve been going to the gym almost 5 times a week every week since the first day I quit. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing much. I definitely feel stronger, and that helps.

"40 days in. Just exactly at that point where you start to feel like maybe it wasnt such a big deal to quit. I got to my sisters. Im staying a week at her apartment. She is gone right now. ....as im putting my things away ...corner of my eye catches SOME MARLBORO LIGHTS. WHAT!? SNUGGLED IN A TIN ON THE BOOKSHELF. WHAT IS HAPPENING MY SISTER DOESNT EVEN SMOKE!? MY HEAD BEGINS TO REEL. I THINK IM DIZZY IM SO EXCITED AND SHOOK. SHES NOT HERE I COULD SMOKE ONE AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW. WHERE IS THE LIGHTER!??? You guys i BARELY was able to get off that craving-go-round. I thought i was a goner...this was a close one. Addiction doesn't play y'all. Stay vigilant. Come here and read a little BEFORE YOU SMOKE. Remember why you quit. It will all come rushing back. Remember the misery. Quit for those who were never able to. Quit because fuck big tobacco. Fucking parasite/murderers.

I am 40 days in! not gunna lie i HAVE had a hard time with this and continue to. But im still glad Im doing it..I'm realizing cigarettes were a hugely toxic thing covering up issues i SERIOUSLY need to face in my life. Unaddressed depression/adhd. Holy freakin smokes. My mental health has gone buckwild since quitting. But i know i have to press on. I'm currently working on seeing if im deficient vitamine/mineral-wisw in anything...messing around with diet to see if theres any foods that might be contributing to the depression and acne breakouts. Started praying to check and see if God exists and if i could rely on such a one instead of earthly dopamine sources. Idk. I'm just shaking things up. Quitting smoking. When the fog cleared i could better see what needs work in my life. And the worry and guilt about smoking so much, about spending so much; feels really good to have that be gone. To be doing something i actually am proud of, flipping a bird to big tobacco. Finally. I remember all my tears in the beginning of this quit. Wanting so badly to be free while i sucked down cigarette after cigarette and could not stop. Fight me on this if you want but I do believe it is much harder to quit if you are depressed or adhd. Somehow that nicotine/dope hit is 3000001x more precious to you bc you were already starting from a place of lack of ""feel ok in life"" chemicals.  But it can be done. And i frickin SEE YOU trying to quit. And I see the magnitude of the battle you're in. Keep going!!!!",stopsmoking

"I am an avid drug user. That might seem off-putting to some, but I manage my use extremely well and believe drugs enhance my life. I use drugs proactively and with purpose, rather than reactively. I have never had a dependence on any drug, nor engaged in a use pattern one might consider abusive. Well, except for nicotine.

I was previously a heavy vaper for about two years, then I took Tabex which reduced, but didn't eliminate my use.  The past year or so my nicotine habits have been ""social"" or intermittent. Typically I'll buy a disposable vape on a Friday and kill it over the weekend.  Sometimes I'll indulge when I'm stressed like during exams season. 

My current dilemma is that some of my favorite other drugs, Adderall, alcohol, and Modafinil, trigger cravings. I haven't had nicotine in 2 weeks and took an Adderall this morning to get some work done; all I can do is think about walking down to the smoke shop and buying a vape. Alcohol is similar, typically I drink 2x/week; heavy (4-7 drinks) on Friday and moderate (2-3) on Saturday. I crave nicotine intensely when I'm drunk.

Now the obvious solution here is ""stop drinking"" and ""stop taking stimulants"" but as an introverted college student I have to be honest, I'm not willing to give up drinking. 

Does anyone have suggestions on how to cope with cravings?",stopsmoking

"At nearly 2 weeks in to my latest quit, I feel more confident and comfortable that this quit is it. After trying to put my finger on what the difference is this time, this morning I think I have my answer and wanted to share it with you. Although in the past I wanted to quit smoking, there was also a part of me that still wanted to smoke. This time I want to quit smoking AND I also don't want to smoke anymore. As in I wouldn't smoke even if someone paid me to smoke. Let's say even if the cigarette companies turned around and gave me all my money back to start again, I'd decline, middle finger up.  For the first time I can see that smoking is, in a word, stupid and in another word, it stinks. And to further my point a little farther, as someone wrote here, a slow suicide.

"Hey guys, just wanted to post a celebration post, I don't remember my exact quit date but I think it might have been 1st of september, that makes me 1 month and 2 days off nicotine.

I'm using patches, originally 25mg (that was way too high tbh, so I've just gone down to 21mg, expecting to feel slightly off for the next few days)

Proud of myself because I knew cold turkey was too scary for me, I have tried a few times but usually relapsed at 3 weeks due to depression, but I still haven't put a cigarette in my mouth for a whole month (apart from one slip, which I don't count as a relapse cos I didn't feel the need to continue, I just continued putting the patches on the following days), the patch helps a lot and I've had very little cravings, even hanging around other smokers (defo need to shake up my social circle tho, so I am around less people who could trigger me as I ween off patches too)

I'm going to start lowering my patch strength come halloween, so the end of this month, I'll go 14mg for 2 weeks and then 7mg for 2 weeks, I'm expecting it to be tough but I've been using this month to break the lifestyle addiction and learn as much about quitting as I can and strengthening my resolve.

I haven't been a smoker for long, only about a year and a half, so I know I should quit sooner rather than later as I'm just making it harder for future me, and I don't see a future for myself where I continue smoking, my lungs were already feeling it and I struggled to run 1km, where I was previously a super sporty person.

I think what has helped my recovery is I'm not *just* quitting smoking, I'm building up my whole life, replacing bad habits with good ones etc, finding things to look forward to, making huge changes... eg I started a new job, been going to the gym for zumba classes, yoga.. I started brazillian jiu jitsu, I'm looking at other hobbies and classes to try and theres a board game club I'll be going to on saturdays, I have spent a lot of time thinking about my future and what I want and I even have a mild career path/direction, and once I'm at my next job in a few months (in warehouse right now, plan to move to office work), I'll have my evenings free and more stuff to do, cos that's what I need, I smoked cos I was depressed cos my life sucked, so I'm making my life a good one.

Anyway, this is turning into a ramble, just wanted to join the conversation and share my own thoughts and experiences so far.

"It started with one puff in school and gradually it carried on for 18 years until I realised the amount of money I spend in a week on cigarettes. Thanks to the cost in Ireland, ¬£14.30/Pack of 20.  I started saving those money in a separate e-wallet and on completing 200 days I will gift myself something special.  I am loving the cumulative. 

How I feel now?

\-- There is a change in my breathing. I stopped taking a deep breath with open mouth after an interval. 

\-- I snore less now.

\--I no more hate sweetness in food. 

\--I don't feel tired whole day and also yawn less and don't fear for aerobic activities. 

\--Drinking alcohol without smoking was no fun for me. So, my drinking habit made a sharp decline just like the economy after the covid lockdown, and during this period I drank around 5-6 times which was earlier 3-4 times a week. 

\--I learned the relation between pressure with smoke. Now, I don't take unnecessary pressure just to find an excuse to smoke. 

\--My digestion is also getting better after the decrease of alcohol and smoking combo. 

\--I get more time for myself. Take this as an eg. I am sharing this on a Sunday morning at 9am. Previously, Sunday morning was reserved for a hangover.

My name is Matej and I thought this might be a good place to present our idea. In October we are launching our first Kickstarter campaign where we will present an essential oil inhaler Kiff. Kiff is an all-new wooden essential oil inhaler that has been designed to alleviate feelings of stress and anxiety. The reason we created Kiff is to help people quit bad habits such as smoking and solve problems that motivate people to pick them up in the first place.

"I did it. After 14 years of smoking I just stopped. Cold Turkey.

But after al these days without smoking, it gets easier to convince yourself that you‚Äôre a non-smoker now. Cravings are just a thought about smoking again. Enjoying this  thoughts and letting them pass again, is how I cope with them. 

**benefits of stopping:**
- Breathing gets easier, no more coughing all the time.
- You don‚Äôt smell like an ashtray, in fact you smell good.
- No more interruptions throughout your day.
- No more mood swings depending on your nicotine level. 
- Being able to exercise a again.
- Not having to part from a group to ply your lonely vice.
- Not having to stand in the cold or rain, because you don‚Äôt have a choice.
- Freedom

**How to stop (How I did it):**
- Plan your last cigarette.
- Smoke your last cigarette at night before sleep (wake up as a non-smoker).
- Drink a glass of water when you have cravings. Enjoy how the water tastes better over time. 
- When having a bad craving, go to the supermarket and buy yourself a treat, something sweet. Donuts worked for me. I bought 2 or 3 Donuts and I was good for a bad day.
- Don‚Äôt  drink coffee the first 2 weeks. After 2 weeks it gets easier to just drink coffee without craving a cigarette. You‚Äôll be happy just being able to drink coffee again. Don‚Äôt drink too much though, use it as a coping mechanism Whenever you have cravings to smoke, just enjoy the coffee instead.
- Enjoy other people‚Äôs smoke, don‚Äôt avoid it. Have the sweet memories of smoking and accept that those days are behind you. That you‚Äôre feeling much better physically. And that the journey is totally worth it.

"I quit weed on 24/9/21.. 4 days later I thought I may as well kick nicotine too (vaped for a few years, past year only 3mg)

So here I am, the first 2 days was brutal, yesterday was ok maybe 4/10 on a scale, today its been a 2/10.. but I am restless, my will power will never let me take another puff every again. But im finding myself with a tonne of energy snd Im so hungry.  Its 6:30 and Ive been up all night, no amount of food is helping and I cant go to sleep because I feel like I have lots of energy.. I dont even know why Im posting this, do I want somebody body to tell me well done? Is there an answer for my restlessness? Im also insanely bored. Ive exercised like fuck, most of my muscle groups are sore and need recovery.
 Theres only so much exercise you can do. The cravings are still here but no way will I ever smoke again. I stopped cold turkey thanks to Allan Carr. Since my 4 day quit spree I have convinced 3 others to join me. I think I just want company tbh, maybe a well done, sad I know but I feel like nobody's bothered or jealous of me really, smokers in work tend to look the other way when I tell them.

"Hi all. seeing so many success stories here makes me want to hopeful, but I have one massive hurdle that keeps getting in my way. How do you guys deal with stress?

Unfortunately, I don't mean day to day, ""normal"" stressors, like work and bills and arguments with the SO. I have a special needs teen, elderly parents with severe health issues, a vindictive ex who won't stay out of my life, and zero support (for the day to day as well as quitting). I don't get a break from the BS flying at me, and on any given day it's all I can do to not start screaming, even without trying to quit. It seems like every time I try, or even just plan to quit, it amps up significantly. This go round, in the weeks leading up to my planned quit day my landlord informed me that he's renovating and I have to move by the end of the month, my father has fallen ill, my daughter is having daily meltdowns (she has ASD), the ex abruptly stopped paying support, the car broke down, and my cat needs surgery. Yep.

Quit day was today, and I went for I regardles. It went well for almost two hours, but probably because I was up hours before anyone else, and had quiet. Once the kiddo was up and the parents were calling, I found myself in the RoFo parking lot with a full pack in hand and hating myself.

Things are not going to change anytime soon, so I have to find a way to handle it, but I'm at a loss. I've tried breathing exercises, meditation, exercise, going for walks, etc, and it only helps as long as I'm able to continue actively doing it. I have to work, so it's not as if I can just spend all day trying to destress. Due to allergies, NRT and meds are not options for me, nor is any kind of medication for stress (yay). Logically, I understand that it's a matter of willpower, but too often I'm just crumbling under the pressure, and I don't know how to steely up against it.",stopsmoking

"This is the longest I've gone without a dart since 2017 - back when I was just a social smoker. I feel amazing; I'm happy, I'm exercising regularly, the house has never been cleaner. I feel like I able to devote more energy to things I would usually put off. I've got savings for the first time in what feels like ages. I can run 8k without feeling exhausted. I'm just hoping that I can keep this up.

I'd failed quitting about 3-5 times in a row before this attempt. I would buy a pack, smoke one then run it under the taps in frustration. I didn't think this was going to be a successful attempt. The first three days were shit. Felt like smashing my head into a wall. Nearly cracked every single day, even to the extent of going to the shops and then dragging my sorry addict self back home without buying anything. It was so rough I couldn't possibly have imagined that this attempt at quitting would be one that would last this long. I'm glad I persisted.  
The next week after was much easier. The 'I want to die' and the 'I can't function without a cigarette' cravings became more manageable. What was in their place though was the 'wouldn't it be nice if you had a smoke right now' thoughts. They're so subtle, seemingly so sensible that  they're almost convincing. You only realise through time that they're just as much part of the addiction as the withdrawals are.  


Around this time I started exercising, at first short walks, then small body weight exercises. By week 2 I was running and lifting weights. If there was one thing that stopped me from smoking in that time it was that. You get excited about how much you can lift and how far you can run the next day. Instead of sitting in bed at night thinking about the morning dart, you're planning out the route you're going to ride. The thought of ruining the progress of my exercise (and awful thought of having to go through the heavy withdrawals again) kept me honest.   


I haven't left nicotine behind me yet, I feel like it might be 3 months before I can say that I've truly beaten the addiction. Day to day I don't really have any cravings, but there's still the odd thought of smoking every now and again. I definitely still get cravings when I drink, so I've learned to stay away from alcohol, or drink light beer so that it's a little more manageable. But I'm hopeful this is going to continue. I'm looking forward to writing my 3 month post. To those who gave me advice and support through the tough times, thank you. To those going through the early days, or have just had a failed attempt, just know it's definitely worth sticking out to get to this point. Good luck everyone :)",stopsmoking

Everyone got their own story but for me it was depression and things along the way. Right now I'm just fighting my battle and I know I wouldn't have minded this much for smoking to just calm my nerves but you know, when I start and get going its like I smoke multiple times, chain smoking.

"Hello!

I'm so glad I found this community, as I really need to feel like I'm quitting this nasty habit with others.

I stopped smoking a year and a half ago alongside my mum, after many failed attempts solo. We used the patches and gum (took a good few months to give the gum up too), but it was honestly the fact that we were in it together that majorly helped me! 

2 months ago, I got my ADHD diagnosis, and was put on a generic form of ritalin. Around the same time, I went through a painful breakup, and immediately went to buy cigarettes, didn't even give it a second thought.

I then bought the gum again, as I started a full time job (my first, after being a self employed fitness instructor for the last few years), and it's pretty full on and stressful, as well a physically demanding, so wanted to have the comfort of knowing I could have a nicotine fix without the cigarettes. 

What did I end up doing instead?

Smoking AND chewing gum. I'm a genius...

And now I need to stop this before it goes on any further.

I don't know what it is, but the diagnosis kind of affirmed my impulses and almost provided me with an excuse (it's my ADHD, oopsies, so impulsive, not my fault). 

It's morning, I'm on my way to work, have had a cigarette, but no gum. The gum really hurts my stomach, I chew a ton of the stuff

I'm so anxious about the prospect of having nothing to provide me with an escape or a release, so I've come here.

Can anyone give me any tips? Or even words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.

"Hello

I'm 20 years old. I'm freaked out of my mind about my health. I smoke about 5 cigarettes a day, sometimes more, usually totalling to around 50 a week. I tried quitting before but I was not able to do it successfully. I recently moved into my own place, and have upped my number to the 5 I mentioned above, I used to smoke maybe 2 a day before that. Lately, I've been able to feel the pain in my lungs when I'm on my 4th cigarette or so. I associate smoking with a lot of my activities and I think that association is deterring me quite a bit. I want to change this. 

I am going to try quitting again, but I also want something to keep my hands busy and preferably my mouth too. I saw someone mention a bubble blower.

I've never used any nicotine products before a couple of days ago.

I'm wondering if my experience is brand specific or if this is pretty standard with lozenge.

So, what I am referring to is basically the way it dissolved slowly into a kind of goop that coats the mouth. Its as if the lozenge doesn't dissolve so much as it slowly absorbs saliva which turns it slimy and you have to suck the slime off of it to allow it to absorb more saliva and repeat.

Just remember, that only 15% procent of people with lung cancer are alive after 5 years after the diagnosis, and some 80% are dead within 2 years.

You will slowly drown in your own fluids over those 2-5 years, while feeling like shit 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

You will most likely lose your mind as well, as these type of cancers have a nice little habbit of spreading to the brain as well.  About 20 to 40 percent of adults with non-small cell lung cancer go on to develop brain metastases at some point during their illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, don't forget how everyone around you will be devastated in the process of seing you turn into a living mummy and eventually die-off.

&amp;#x200B;

Also remember that the risk of getting lung cancer as a former heavy smoker is almost four times higher than a never-smoker even 25 years after quitting.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you don't get it you will still acounter these issues amongst many others if you continue:

You will be out of breath.

You will never be at your best. 

You will look older than you are.

Many people will avoid being near, you and developing relationships with you. 

You will waste a lot of time, and money.

"I‚Äôm 45 days clean now after smoking 10+ years. It really is all about getting over that hump. I ended up eating and snacking a lot to get through the cravings the first couple weeks. I was constantly cheek biting and having anxious fits. That first 3 days was rough, the first week was a huge accomplishment for me. I literally started to lose count of the days after the first 2 and a half weeks. I have to remind myself how long it‚Äôs been. I don‚Äôt even think about cigarettes much anymore. Well, not as often, sometimes I see someone with a cigarette on TV or I see a photo of cigarettes and it triggers me a little. But then I remind myself I‚Äôve been off of them for so long and it‚Äôs a slippery slope to have just one. 
I never thought i could do it and I tried to quit like 100 times, maybe even more in my life without any success. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm someone who was able to quit to be honest.",stopsmoking
"The last time I was doing really well quitting I used an app called ""SmokeFree"" (as opposed to Smoke Free which seems popular here).  You set your app up with how much you currently smoke and how many days you want to spend weening down, and then you hit a button on the app or on a widget to track when you can smoke and it gives you a timer that tells you when the next time you're allowed to smoke to stay on schedule.

I wake up feeling better, and I can actually be present in the moment.

I would be lying at this point if I said that I didn't miss it. I absolutely do. I don't know if I'll stumble. It is currently the constant vigilance that is preventing me from doing so. I do not want to feel like I am safe.",stopsmoking
I quit smoking 3 months ago which I am super proud of as I was a smoker for 20 years. I went through all the withdrawals which are horrible but I kept pushing. Now at 3 months my teeth hurt! The last 2 days is on and of throbbing and pain. I always went for cleanings and even upped them to every 3 months for the last few years due to the smoking. Has anyone had teeth pain at 3 months?

"I smoked my last cigarette 17 days ago, and I've been doing really well. Escaping smoking has been the best thing for me. It even gave me the confidence to apply for a position at a school I hope to one day teach at. Before quitting, working on a no-smoking campus would have been a no-go, but as a non-smoker smoking policies don't hold me back

Well,  I nailed the interview and am pretty much guaranteed the position and I'm feeling great! But why then did my subconscious literally take the wheel of my car and  begin leading me toward a gas station to buy cigarettes? It's the weirdest thing -- like self-sabotage. Could be that I just went through an intense feeling, but it was overwhelmingly positive. I'm taken aback, really, and I'm just glad I pulled over and let my mind take control of the wheel back.

"Hi everyone, first post and not a very experienced redittor but I needed to ask this somewhere. 

I started smoking at I think 19 or 20. I'm 35 now. Several times I've tried to quit. I think the longest I ever went was a few month in my 20s and once for about 4 months five years ago. I've tried cold turkey methods with guidance, I've also tried patches or vaping instead of smoking. Vaping of course works, its just expensive and a lot of the motivation is the cost. Patches are much cheaper in my country. Though its still hard to just use the patch and nothing else. Anyway what really forces me back into it more than anything else is anger. 

I know irritability is a common side effect of withdrawal. The thing is even as a smoker I can be an irritable person. I have actually talked to a therapist about it but I can't afford to see one right now. Little stuff does frustrate me and while I have been verbally temperamental at times I have never in my life been violent. I just get worked up about little stuff and can give you a nice long rant. 

But when I don't have nicotine in my system, frankly, I frighten myself. My thoughts are not just ""irritability"", they are violent thoughts. Something in politics or entertainment will annoy me and I start having violent fantasies about the person in question. I'll start to fantasize about scenarios that haven't even happened and get images in my mind that are really disturbing and violent. I feel not just irritable but frankly consumed by a homicidal rage. And I know the only thing that will make them go away is nicotine. This can't be normal. I've tried so many times to quit and always I go right back to it because even though I hate myself as a smoker I hate myself when I'm not smoking so much more. I want everyone to know I can say with 100% certainty that I am not violent in actions and never would be. I've never hurt anyone, I'm not a dangerous psychotic, I promise you so please I'm being very vulnerable by admitting that this goes on inside me. I don't like that I think these things and what I'm trying to figure out is if anyone elses thoughts are so extreme when they are in withdrawl and if they ever stopped if so. When ""irritability"" is listed as a symptom, that doesn't feel like it describes the intensity of these feelings of raw hatred. I'm scared to be around people. I know I wouldn't hurt anyone but I might express the feeling and scare them away. So I smoke. And I hate it. And yet I feel like I pretty much have to just give up and live with being a smoker for the rest of my life. It might be less depressing than the constant failure to quit and these thoughts that plague my brain every time I try to quit.",stopsmoking

"So first of all, I‚Äôm gonna take my small victories where I can: last time I slipped, I smoked 10 cigarettes after almost 14 days of not smoking. So I‚Äôm picking myself up, dusting myself off, and continuing to go after 8 fewer cigarettes. Obviously not smoking would have been better, but I‚Äôm giving myself compassion. I‚Äôm only human.

The following triggers were there for me:

1) Somebody left their cigarettes in the break room

2) I was having a REALLY, REALLY crappy Monday. Like, considering turning in my notice crappy.

3) I had to deal with a poopy, disgusting, clogged toilet at work (janitorial position) which

4) Was not fixed after a solid plunge

Again, I‚Äôm only human and a lot of people  would have wanted something to take the edge off in that case. The best thing I can do is be prepared to deal with such a trigger before it happens again. So tonight I‚Äôm meditating before bed. I will meditate every night until the streak is broken. Hopefully that should give me more power when next time happens so I‚Äôm not letting a disgusting toilet have that much power over me.",stopsmoking

Day 4 was easier.

Today is hard again. My husband is attempting to quit with me. He caved and bought a pack yesterday but he only smoked two out of it. He wouldn't let me throw them out so I taped the pack closed and wrote over the tape overlap for accountability. If either of us want one, we have to break the seal.

I put the pack away, so it's not in view, but I keep thinking about the fact that it's there. I really should just destroy it. 

My brain keeps latching onto the idea of Just One. It's such a lie. Such a terrible lie. There is no Just One. There never has been. One begets another begets another.

I've been doing my best to keep busy. Every time I get a craving I go do a chore for ten minutes. It's been 50/50 whether it works to stem the craving. At least the house is cleaner. I haven't left a single dish in the sink since my quit started lol.

"So this isn't a 'I've quit and I'm feeling brilliant' post. This is a 'I couldn't quit but I've cut right down' post. Mainly because I'm over an extremely stressful time in my life (lost job and ex partner in the same month). Here's what I've noticed for those who are still on 20 a day. 

\- If you're male, smoking DEFINITELY affects your sex life. Time it takes to get hard. Endurance. Size. Girth. Yeah. Since I cut right down my new g/f says she feels like I am 'bigger'. I can also last longer. 

\- Naturally, only on five a day I'm only buying a pack once every four days. Money saved. 

\- My appetite has increased. I actually feel properly hungry now and eating doesn't feel like a chore that I have to do because it's the right time of day. 

\- I'm not coughing constantly in the morning. 

\- A few hours after waking up I feel like I am full of energy and have a mega amount of stamina. In the gym I can train for at least 30 mins longer and the pump I get is unreal. 

The plan is to quit completely (eventually). Not sure when. Take it from me though, if you're still smoking 20 a day you kinda get used to feeling a certain way and it feels like that's how life feels. It's not. I use the Quickmist here in the UK and only smoke after a meal. Kinda when I enjoy it the most, like most people. 

If you can't quit, or you keep trying to quit but can't, get some fast acting NRT and only smoke when you really feel like having one. I attribute most of the benefits I felt to having increased oxygen levels in my blood. Can only be a good thing !!",stopsmoking

I'm 24, been smoking (and vaping, snuffing...) for ¬±10 years, quit just yesterday. Now, these numbers are nowhere near as impressive as coming from people with an addiction longer than my lifespan. Still, it sucked growing up with cigarettes and ""the miraculous alternative"" that vaping seemed to be. 

I took a plastic bag and gathered nicotine paraphernalia that I can throw out. Swelling with pride, I walked up to my mum, telling her ""think I won't need then anymore in my life"". She asked why, I explained briefly how damaging it was. When I was done going over health effects of smoking, she looked at me, half pitiful, half disdainful:

""...and you just found out?""

Now, for the context, I'm taking a medical major, so I'm literally required to know that. She's never smoked herself, so probably not envy. Plus I've had some things I tried to quit in the past, and she's been nothing short of perfectly supportive. So, why this?

I immediately regretted telling her and went outside to throw this bag out. Needless to say, I spent some time sobbing and went back straight to the bathroom to somehow conceal my red eyes. She entered and I said how inappropriate this was. Apparently it was meant to be a ""joke"". That's even fucking worse then, I'd rather be genuinely discouraged. 

What sucks the most though is how lightly she took it, having personally known a dude who died from smoking related lung cancer. This dude was my age when he died. And he continued smoking days before his death.

I have been a smoker since 2010 and burn 4 to 5 cigarettes on average everyday. Sometimes over a pack of 10 in a day. A couple weeks back it just occurred to me to quit smoking. It's been over 15 days now that I haven't tasted nicotine.

I was able to suppress the urge by keeping myself busy with work, reading, netflix. 

I have also gone without smoking for a whole month during the Ramadan fasts. The hunger was a good distraction. But now, I don't think I can stay calmly without smoking. I get anxious, have difficulty breathing and cannot concentrate in my work.

I have compulsions sometimes to bite my nails, clench my wrists tight, repeatedly crack my knuckles and neck. These compulsions are getting amplified every minute.

How did you manage to quit smoking?
Did you exhibit any symptoms in your journey?
Did you slip? 
Is it ok to slip and smoke one cigarette a day as reward?",stopsmoking

"Hey I'm Jo, I just downloaded quitsure and did the math, it's been 20 years since I first started regularly smoking. I'm only 34. My first drag was closer to 8 y/o, but I grew up in smokey houses and smokey cars, so really I've been addicted to nicotine pretty much my whole life.

I've quit many times before or as I decided to phrase it, I ""practiced quitting"" many times. Only 3 times did I last over six months. First time was when I was pregnant(kiddo is now 13), second time I quit 2 months shy of 5 years(!) I thought I was free and done forever! Then some stuff got super messy and I started again. All it takes is ONE... *sigh* then a couple of months after I restarted I quit for 3 months and then 6 months, and several other times as well. I fought it, but I failed. Now I've been regularly smoking for oh, I'm not exactly sure, but probably close to two years again. 
I don't like smoking. I don't enjoy the taste, the drags, the exhale, the smell, any of it.
When I quit for almost 5 years, I went from cigarettes to having vape in the morning, moved my cigarettes later in the day, until I was only vaping, then worked my nicotine down to 0 MG, then vaped later in the day until it was days between, then months, I kept my vape charged and within reach for six months after I quit. 
That just sounds like a lot to go through right now, I just want to be done. So I'm going to try the quitsure.
I'm just ready to be done, yet I keep picking up cigarettes... I had swapped to vape again a few months ago, but I  haven't even been using my vape lately at all, just keep smoking...
I smoke about half a pack a day consistently, more when I drink which is about a couple times a week 2 weeks a month. 

Anyways, glad to be here.",stopsmoking

Four nights ago, after massively chain-smoking for days, I went to bed around 10pm and awoke about 2:30am feeling llike I was  about to die. I was ompletely wracked with pain. I do  have an ongoing digestive disorder and am no stranger to pain, but with was ***PAIN***.   


Also had a bit of the old vomit, which tasted feral. Aftr a few hours, I realised that taste was from the cigaretttes. I had not had a cigarette since just before bed the previous night, so I decidedd to just continue not having one. (Can't buy any anyway because I'm still not well enoughh to leave the house.  


)I have had no craings whatsoever. My mind will occasionally think of the habit, but I just tell myself it's been four days now, might as well keep going. I've been wanting to quit for years so it would be ridiculous to smoke again now while it's so easy to not smoke.",stopsmoking

Okay so I‚Äôve been vaping for 6 years. I am 21 years old and have been vaping HEAVILY (every day pretty much) since I was just 15.

I know it‚Äôs horrible and I‚Äôm even at the point where I‚Äôm just disgusted with it and with myself all together. I know that EVERYTHING in my life will improve if I can just. Put. This. Stupid.

I really struggled through the first few weeks with irritability and cravings but got through it with the help of my partner who also quit at the same time.

Some real talk: 
- My health has never been worse. That is, I‚Äôm fatter than ever and have somehow got some pretty serious stomach and bowel issues which started at almost exactly the same time as giving up. (Probably from the binge eating and the over exercising combo.)   
- I would still love a ciggie sometimes. 
- I know I can still lapse at any moment. I know I can still lapse at any moment. I know. 

However‚Ä¶..

I am delighted that it has been 6 months since I had a cigarette in my car! 6 months of a smoke free home, 6 months of never buying a packet, 6 months of walking around my home without always carrying a packet and a lighter‚Ä¶. 6 months of freedom! 6 months of cuddles with my nieces and nephews and family and friends without any fear and/or guilt and shame of stinking! 6 months of delicious food and drink‚Ä¶ money and pride!!! 6 months of enjoying the warm inside and coffee breaks uninterrupted, 6 months of really listening and connecting to people without the mind taking me off to that nicotine craving. 6 months of not being distracted by my addiction every moment‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 6 months closer to taking that last EVER puff.

Also my best friend is very anti smoking (because of her mom) and I feel like she would be disappointed in me if I smoked even just once.

"Hello everyone :-)

I've quit 71 days ago, and I can say that for now I usually don't think about smoking or miss it. Honestly.  Yes, there are some days when I think about It, but rather about weird psychological tension in my chest like when you have cravings. 

But goal of my post in the next:

When we have fear, anxiety or something like that usually these feelings place in the middle of the chest, this is the place where fears usually feels, center place. Every person, doesn't matter smoker or not, feels these feelings often in this place in the body.

But where we feel desire to smoke (cravings) ?

In my experience, It is the same place, in the chest, because lack of nicotine make us anxious.

And when we quit smoking, even in months, sometimes when we feel us sad or anxious we MAY think that It's cravings BUT in the real it's is just anxiety or another emotion in the chest.

So don't let your brain mix cravings with feelings when you feel sad or somewhat else.

It needs sometime to rewire our brains and find out that these feelings in the chest are not signs of the cravings. 

Also I want to notice that very big help gives mindfulness practice especially when we have cravings. It learn us to let it go. One of the important skills especially when we try to free ourselves in our inner space is observe and let it go. not pressure. but just letting go.

This way we can save our energy and don't feel us overloaded.

You'll let it go in one day totally, this feeling that you're smoker, or you are ex-smoker, or you hate smoking or romanticize it. In one day you'll just let smoking in your head disappear. When you won't overthinking about It. You'll know just fact that you were smoker and now you are free.

But don't hurry and don't make too pressure in you. If you feel yourself right now sad about your decision to stop, you should know, you'll be better. 100%. 

If you feel overwhelmed about your decision, just do step by step. You'll see you'll be better.

For example, only one month ago I felt myself very different and harder than I feel now. 

I don't want to describe all these changes and benefits. You can check out my post where I describe benefits after 1 month. And imagine that It become more and more visible and sensible.

Good luck, you should know you can do it if you really want, I know sometimes you feel like you can't, but just go forward and you'll see.",stopsmoking

"Here's how it went

I had an accountability partner. My mother. This was the thing that helped me the most.

I quit because I was genuinely tired of smoking. I hated it.

At day 7 i got the worst cravings ever. My mom helped me get through them. After day 7 it got easier. On day 19 I had a slip, took one cigarette. Day 29 I had another slip and took another one. Other than that I've been clean.

I am now on day 37 and I have no plans to go back. No seriously I don't have any cravings anymore. At all. The desire to smoke is totally gone and I even hate the smell now.

I have SO MUCH MORE energy now. Plus, going to the gym helped me quit.

"I'll try to be straight foward about it because that's how sick I am of cigarettes, even just talking about my struggles is driving me nuts.

I have smoked since I'm 22 years old and it was over the stupidiest reason ever: wanting to fit in with a new group of friends (the friends didn't last but damn the addiction did). It has been almost 8 years since then, and I've been talking about quiting for at least 4 of it, so I can see why I won't take myself that seriously anymore. I never intended to smoke for long, I just felt in an addiction that was custom made for someone as anxious and compulsive as I am.

This year I finally got my shit together and got to spend one month without it (I'd smoke very rarely one or two, but still counted as quitting). I didn't use any help, just plain will power, which was very hard but made me proud of myself. Unfortunately I relapsed when one of my best friends had a very awful psychotic breakdown and I had to babysit him for months, the stress simply got me and therefore for this one I forgive myself. Around june I decided it was time to do it again, this time with the help of bupoprione, and it was actually pretty easy. I don't think it was only because of the medication, but also because I had the right mindset at the time, THAT one reddit is always saying you need to have in order to actually quit. After a month totally free I even dropped the medication because I was honestly feeling in complete control, happy as never, no coughs, barelly any breathing issues, no stinky clothes and room, not even suffering while hanging with other smokers (I do smoke week though, which helped with these social cravings specifically). Then last month I traveled with my boyfriend, who likes to smoke socially but has no problem not doing it in front of me. I'm not sure how it happened but we decided to buy just a few cigarretes to take for camping, since it was a bit of a tradition back when I used to smoke, and I remember how terrible and completely scared I felt while puffing it again, and of course just a few units became a few packs and soon I was back on it. I know that it isn't my SO responsability to take care of me or my decisions, but I felt very let down for how easy it was for him to just let me relapse while knowing how hard it was for me (but I also understand him, since I'd be on loops saying 'it's ok, with the medication is easy, I will be one of these people who quit whenever they want and that's it'. Yeah right.). 

Anyways, the medication didn't help this time simply because I lost that right mindset needed. Up to that I did a full medical check up and it seems like although smoking clearly makes me cough and gets me throath pain, I am healthier as never. No ashma, no allergies, not a single respiratory issue to be worried about, and I also don't have kids or anyone to 'take into consideration'. I know this sounds insane, but the fear of immediate health issues was a great motivator, and now more than never I need to do it just out of my will, just for knowing it will be bad on the future, just for not liking to be a smoker and this will have to do it, I guess, but damn that's hard.

I've decided to do it again. Tomorrow is the day. I don't have buproprione anymore and I'd take a long time to get it again, so I've bought a few nicotine tablets, lots of cinnamon candy and a couple of shitty red-label cigarretes as well. My plan is to wake up, clean my room (and the disgusting ashes around) and dedicate all my free time on listening Allen Carr's audiobook (that's what the cigarrettes are for, also if it gets really difficult to resist relapsing at least I'll do it with something that reminds me how bad it can be.). I've tried all of these before and none has worked because I didn't have this mtfking mindset, but I can't give up so that's how my strategy will go this time. I'm desperate and honestly sick of dealing with this for so long, I'm utterly mad and willing to use this on my favor. Also, I hope this time I've learned the lesson: it. is. never. just. one.

Thank you guys for reading, I'm currently the only person around me actually wanting to quit and it can get very lonely. Do you guys have any other tips to help me? Does anyone want to be my quitting buddy? God, I really hope I get it right this time.

"* How long a day feels without taking 12-16 smoke breaks. I get productive in a very anxious, unfocused, and inconsistent way just because my brain wants something to distract it for 8 minutes every hour. 

* How annoying it is when you want to do something and you have to wait for another person to take a smoke break. Or when you're watching something and have to pause it for someone else to step out.

* Not sleeping and the intense dreams when I finally do. Can't wait till I have my first ""Oh no I smoked"" dream. Waking up from those always makes me more determined to stay a nonsmoker

* Everyone around me expecting me to behave awful because I'm in the process of quitting. Please let me tell you I'm quitting smoking without cringing or implying you're sorry for my husband. Yes my emotions are heightened, no that doesn't mean I'm suddenly a raging asshole. 

* Having to acknowledge how much I was using cigarettes to avoid things and letting a lot of stuff pile up. Now there's no ""I'll deal with it after a cigarette. Not this cigarette but next cigarette. Well actually the cigarette after dinner."" 

* Smoke smells so bad. Sooooo bad. How do I always forget how bad it smells? All of my clothes smell so gross. I want to take 8 showers and spend two hours brushing my teeth.

"I‚Äôve been smoking for literally half of my life. Started at 14, now I‚Äôm 30. From 26-27 I quit cold turkey. Gained 60lbs in that year. Started smoking again from work stress.

Chantix doesn‚Äôt seem like a good option for me because of other medications I‚Äôm on. Ive never liked the idea of vaping, even though I know it‚Äôs helped many. 
I‚Äôm kinda hesitant to do the patch, so I thought gum might be my best bet. A lot of my enjoyment for smoking stems from oral fixation. I would chew my hair and pencils as a kid. My mouth just likes to stay busy.

"3000 days ago today I joined r/stopsmoking and other non-smokers. I started smoking when I was 16 and smoked for a decade, getting up to a pack a day by the end, sometimes more.

Quitting smoking is one of the most challenging things I've ever done, mentally and physically. But it has been the best decision I made in my life. 

Beyond the excellent health benefits [(check out the improvement on my gums!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/73vub5/before_after_quitting_smoking_four_years_of_gum/), quitting helped me really feel like I was in charge of my life. It helped me realize that I could do what I wanted, could make the decisions I needed. 

I could be stronger than addiction, social pressure, marketing pressure - all of it. 

When I first quit, I counted every single day without a cigarette, and I was convinced that I would spend the rest of my life wishing to have another. 

3000 days later and I only know because of this sub.

If you're thinking about quitting, or have just started, know that you can do it. You can go the rest of your life never having another cigarette.

No cigs for a pure month and one week. All this work, and my wife's ecig... Hey its not a cig.. it cant be that bad just sitting there on the couch. I started puffing it like it was a baby's milk bottle.  That rush, not as good as a cig but I felt bad, my lungs hurt, but my depression I had for the last month went away... I was able to have a good night. All night I felt good. For the first time in a month... I smiled. I was motivated... I actually enjoyed watching a movie with her, and I laughed! 

I feel bad... but it made me feel happy. I smiled for the first time in over a month. I felt like crying. My depression is so bad, and im already on pills for it. But Nic... it makes me go... it makes me interested in things. I hate you... but I want you...

"Hey guys, first time here. I quit one year (and 2 days, I've been busy) ago after 11-12 years of smoking. I even totally forgot about it except I set an alarm when I decided to quit. 

Honestly, the last year, I haven't even thought about cigarettes. (Also was a pipe smoker, and cigars, and vaping). Neither lusted for them, nor hated them. Just completely out of sight out of mind. Indifferent. Forgot I was even a smoker, except for the odd times that I smelled it and thought ""Oh, a smoker. Didn't I used to be like that? Smells kind of unpleasant."" 

I have no right to tell you how to live your life and all, but for me - I don't miss it at all, and... you know,...it's not great. It's just... normal. No triumph - just normal blandness. Tobacco's not some magic pixie dust, nor is it some insurmountable demon. It's just something you don't think about. I have no doubt that I won't ever smoke again. I know current quitters have tough problems, and it's not that easy, but just accept this: **You're a non-smoker. You're normal.** Non-smokers don't even think about cigarettes. Cigarettes? What? Wtf is that? **Smokers are people who think about smoking. Non-smokers don't even notice it.** 

Good luck! And trust me - it's not better now. Life's still whatever. But a puff does nothing for me.",stopsmoking

"Checking in here at the end of the last cigarette of my life. I had quit vaping (which I had picked up to stop smoking) at new years of 2021. 6 months later, during a time where I decided to not drink for a while either, I had thought I was strong enough, feeling good enough, in control enough, to have a cigarette while visiting a friend.

This obviously meant I was OK to smoke while I wasn't drinking and hanging out with smokers. This then meant I was OK to smoke when I *was* drinking and hanging out with smokers. This then meant I was OK to have a cigarette when drinking and hanging out with non-smokers. This then meant I was OK to smoke in the day, just by myself, and here I am all over again. The slope is indeed very slippery, and rationalised all the way through.

I end up hating myself for this regression, and realisation that I can't control it without a change. Here I am for day 1 again - along with not drinking for a month to get past the initial phase. I'll be visiting here whenever I feel tempted, and am looking forward to that feeling when I had indeed quit for a while, where smoking wasn't on my mind whatsoever.

Quitting after 46 years. Pack a day plus smoker.  

I've only tried to quit once before now, that lasted 40 days. I got all riled up over what was basically nothing, lit up and that was it for quit attempt number one. 

Then I had something happen that convinced me that it would be in my best interests to quit.

"Apologies in advance - this is super rambly because I'm fighting a craving and I need to keep my brain distracted.

I quit smoking in Dec 2018. Cold turkey, full stop. I had a week-long relapse in Jul 2019 (stemming from the desire to just have ""one"" cigarette with a beer on the patio) and stopped it from going any further. I felt so *strong* and almost kind of smug. I kicked its ass and walked away. 

My husband quit in Sep 2019, on our wedding day. We went on honeymoon and actually got to enjoy ourselves instead of stopping every hour to refill with nicotine. 

In Dec 2019 my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I almost relapsed. In Apr 2020 my brother died suddenly. I started smoking at the viewing. 

Three months later my husband started smoking again too. 

Since then I've had four attempted quits. Each lasted between 2 days and 2 weeks and then the stress became unbearable.

Two nights ago I went out for my last cig of the night and it tasted like I was smoking straight ammonia. Like just insanely gross and acrid. I have no idea why - I'd smoked the whole rest of the pack without issue. Something about that last one just really tasted disgusting. And I put it out immediately.

Yesterday I couldn't bring myself to want to smoke, the memory of that taste still fresh in my mind. Around 8pm I got a little antsy for one, but I realized I was almost at 24 hours and it seemed dumb to give up that progress for something I don't even actually need.

Today is hard. My husband got up and got his coffee and went outside to smoke and my addiction monster keeps telling me I could just have one. Isn't it nice to sit in the sunshine? Isn't the weather particularly nice out? Isn't this the kind of day you wait all year for, balanced between summer warmth and fall chill? 

Yes. But none of it is made better by a cigarette. And I know that. I know it to my very core that it's a beautiful lie. The cigarette will always be the least enjoyable part of (what it tells me) it enhances. In reality it enhances nothing. It's a useless, smelly, expensive anchor. And I hate that I want it right now.

36 hours have elapsed. I know I'm halfway through the worst of it and I'm trying to hold onto that. I'm just so frustrated with all of it. I'm mad at myself more than anything for being back here again. And I know the way to make it up to myself is to succeed. And I know I've found success before.

"Just found out I‚Äôm pregnant! I‚Äôve been planning a quit strategy for a few months in preparation to this stage, with strong motivation that I wouldn‚Äôt go through a second pregnancy smoking throughout again. The guilt is debilitating, but I won‚Äôt go into that right now. I will just say, I‚Äôve even attended psychologist sessions to find if I could find some underlying reason to why cigarettes are so deeply wired into my ability to function. 

I‚Äôve attempted quit many times now. Even after even a few hours, I get crazy. Like, I start frothing with rage, act like I‚Äôm possessed, have tantrums, wail crying, just severe withdrawals. I know withdrawals are hard, but I don‚Äôt think the way I have them are far from normal. 

So I found out I‚Äôm pregnant, went slow with the pack I had left, got all my gum, nibbles etc ready. Wrote a journal entry telling cigs to F off and began my quit at 5pm yesterday. I already had an episode around 7pm after dinner, had to hide myself in the bedroom closet but my 1.5yr old saw bits of me sobbing and it infuriated me further. Woke up at 7am and 8:30am again I had a massive tantrum acting like I was possessed screaming into my pillow and at am I told my husband this wasn‚Äôt worth it and had a smoke. 


I‚Äôve read Allen Carr, know everything about nicotine addiction, power of the mind. Like I‚Äôve done my research. I‚Äôm willing to go through the temporary pain, but the withdrawals. When they‚Äôre there, I lose my self completely.

I noticed I mostly like to smoke as a way to destress and it simply became a habit. So if I just replace it with a healthier habit, I feel like I can easily quit smoking.

I don't have a problem not smoking when just hanging with my friends, but when we go drinking, it might be a problem for me not to give in and light a ciggie.  How do u guys control yourselves in not giving in when drinking? also, is there any forms of substitutes to nicotine in general that could be smoked/chewed? thanks.",stopsmoking
"I've somehow made it to three whole weeks smoke free today. I've posted a few days I've been struggling here. 

And I honestly am feeling worse than the first week somehow...

I don't think my mind is really in it anymore, and I want to smoke, but the only thing stopping me is ruining my streak.

Life is very stressful at the moment, I moved to a new country and then a new city, and now potentially looking at having to move away again, lots of dreams not being able to happen. The timing feels wrong, and I feel like I'm set up to fail now. Lots of people say it gets easier but honestly for me it's getting harder. I'm in a pretty negative place.

I spent like 20 minutes standing outside a tobacco shop yesterday fighting an internal battle as to why I shouldn't buy anything. (I ended up leaving)

But every day it's all I'm thinking about now, and I just don't feel like my mind is in the right place anymore.",stopsmoking

"I have been smoking for about 10 years now. I quit about 3 times so far.

The first time I quit was 4 years ago. I quit cold turkey every time. 4 months after quitting, I went on a trip abroad. I don't travel abroad much; while I was there, the climate was different. It was vacation, and I decided why not smoke here, try cigarettes from a foreign country and not smoke when I get back home. Well, it wasn't long when I started smoking 1 cigarette a day and back to pack in a month.

The second time when I quit. Same story, different circumstances, this time I was in my home country.

The most recent attempt was about 3 months ago, I quit, and it was going well; I joined a gym, started waking up early etc.

The problem is, every time I drink, I have an uncontrollable urge to smoke, and I promise myself I won't smoke the next day. And this happened very well for about two months.

I am amazed by the ability of some of my friends. They don't smoke while drinking. On infrequent occasions, about 1/10th time we drink, they ask for smoke and enjoy it. They'll never touch a cigarette for the next 6 months or year. Another friend of mine smokes while drinking, we're out of town in some countryside, and the weather is cold and beautiful. He rarely smokes in his hometown and is sober.

How do they do it? How do I do it?

"My boyfriend is trying to quit and I want to do everything I can to help support him. I'd love to know what has worked for you all, what has not helped, anything and everything.

His biggest fears right now are stress and boredom. He loves smoke breaks as a reason to walk away from a conversation and think about it, and he also likes the change of scenery (we're in the same industry and can work 16 hour days for weeks at a time). I've seen suggestions like a ""craving bag"" of candies, gum, etc. I personally know many folks who swear by breathing through a straw, but he thinks it's stupid and I'm not sure he can be convinced otherwise, ha.

Also, aside from tips and tricks, what's the language that can help? I really don't want to pressure him, but of course I naturally want to help remind him to stay on track. I'm worried my ""keep at it"" attitude could stress/annoy him into wanting a cigarette more. What's the least aggravating way to provide support?

Anyway, what I have so far is to make kinda three lists: Reasons to stop smoking and its benefits, reasons why he wants to smoke, and things to do instead of that last list. I'm hoping having something to look at on paper can be a good reminder and such.

"1) I had a strong reason, I guess the same one anyone who is a chronic smoker has, except that I was straight up told by a doctor that my lungs look like a mid 40s smokers lungs in the x ray pics. I was late twenties. That was a wake up punch. I wasn't in the hospital related to respiratory issues, just pre operation testing.

2)  An old man I know quit too, after I guess 50 years of smoking. Him quitting didn't mean much to me, but the way he did it. He said: **You can't think of stopping smoking as ""NEVER smoking again"", you can only think of it as ""you are not smoking NOW"". That is the key attitude in stopping smoking.**

That was brilliant. It is infinitely less burden, less draining, less of a mental weight to think of it as just not smoking this moment. Just this moment, not today, this hour or anything. Just NOW. The never smoking again path/attitude is such a pain, its like carrying a chain with you at all times, it is unsustainable. Imagine forbidding yourself from doing anything ever again, its a horrible feeling.  Its also depressing as shit.

Imagine when you are badly tempted, one of those moments where everything seems meaningless if you just don't light just one sweet cigarette and puff away all of the turmoil. In those moments, if you go by Never mindset, you say to yourself, No no no no, and fight your urges. Excruciatingly. Such a waste of energy. Such anguish. Beating yourself up by yourself. Impossible. And when you exhaust yourself you of course succumb. 

Now imagine the opposite. You get in that hole of despair and you tell yourself, okay in five minutes I'll have one. What happens is that your body calms because all of the craving parts of you have a resolution. They will get what they want in just a few minutes.  No fight with yourself, no mental push/pull. And urges last less than five minutes, which is convenient :), and also lose power over time and ultimately go away. When I stopped I carried a pack of smokes with me for couple of months, just so whenever I had a desire to smoke, I could say to myself; okay, in five minutes I will light up one. No fear, cigarettes are in my pocket and only minutes away from my mouth and my lungs. And in five minutes, I didn't want one anymore, actually I wouldn't even think of it anymore. Please try it. It sounds way too simple but it effing works. 

3) Last is a little mental rewrite. **Cigarettes are not calming, sedating or in any way helping you relax.** They are relaxing your physical addiction to cigarettes. You didn't need them before you started doing them. You smoke, get addicted, crave them, craving makes you uneasy, you smoke them, you relax the craving, some time passes, you crave again... They are not friends.

"Hello beautiful people,
I (23M) have been a smoker for 5 years until an hour ago. I smoked between 1.5-2.5 packets a day.
I have trying to quit for quite some time now and have been failing miserably. Smoking something that I hate for so long and the constant failures have given me depression and tanked my self confidence. It‚Äôs not that I enjoy smoking, in fact, with every passing day I hate it more. 
This depression has impacted other areas of my life: my career is going down hill because I can‚Äôt focus and have zero motivation, I have been out of touch with my  friends. I am trying to spend less and less time with girlfriend, I have stopped working out and I don‚Äôt know if it really is because of failing to quit smoking but that‚Äôs the only plausible culprit in my mind. 

I am making one last attempt at quitting smoking, if I fail I will make peace with this addiction and accept what it entails. But I have promised myself I won‚Äôt go down without a fight. I have always failed not because of crazy compulsion but because I convince myself that one more won‚Äôt hurt.

"Rationally, I know that smoking is just a stupid waste of money and health. However, I started when I was just 12 due to peer pressure, and deep inside of me the belief that having a cigarette in my mouth makes me look better/cooler is still very strong. Now I'm in my mid 20s and I've been a smoker for half of my life. I don't even remember how it feels not to be one. 

I've always struggled with my self image and with agoraphobia, and smoking was my coping mechanism and my way to elevate myself to the standard of people around me. In my culture (Italian) it is a very social thing and the feeling that it's cool/transgressive is still moderately strong among young people.

Now I've moved to a country where smoking is way more frowned upon, but I still can't get rid of this feeling that I will look like a loser if I don't start rolling up a cigarette every time I leave a building, or have one in my hand as I walk to my workplace.",stopsmoking
"Hey everybody, I am relatively new to this forum.  I think this is a great community, and i'm not entirely sure where to ask this question.

When I first started I used a juul and went through roughly 6 pods I took a year long break but got back into it when I started college. This time around I started using disposables, airflows, bidi sticks etc. I probably went through about 12 disposables, but I hope I got through my last one.

I vape CONSTANTLY. I go through slightly more than one disposable every day, and sometimes I‚Äôm wide awake until 5am just sucking on my vape. Being alone vaping in bed in the morning is undoubtedly the highlight of my day. I often drink in excess just to get a stronger hit on the vape. 

I could care less about the potential health effects or honestly the enormous cost; it‚Äôs vaping toll on my mental health that‚Äôs made me want to quit for the past year or so. I have struggled with treatment-resistant depression, generalized anxiety, and OCD for most of my life. In the short-term hitting my vape alleviates symptoms, but the rush and relaxation of it becomes the center of my world. And, of course, being without nicotine for as short a time as 20 minutes causes all my mental health issues to begin to rear their heads.

I‚Äôve put off actually quitting by reasoning that I should finally work out my other issues first, lest they get very intense during withdrawal. However, the vaping is so intermingled with my mental health woes that I think they‚Äôre unsolvable without taking away the nicotine addiction first.

Hello 

I desperately need your opinions on something I have been struggling with. 

I am a non-smoker and my girlfriend is a smoker. She has been smoking 10 cigarettes a day for about 15 years. 

After months of dating we have decided to move forward with our relationship and introduce each other to family, as her family is visiting town in November. I told her I was not okay with her being a smoker when we spoke about this and she immediately agreed she wanted to quit. 

For her first attempt, we did a ‚Äúsober July‚Äù on which she quit cigarettes cold turkey, and we both quit drinking for the entire month. It was tough for her, especially the first week or so. I did notice she seemed a bit less energetic and a bit more lethargic. I tried my best to fill in our free time with healthy activities like hiking and going for walks and remained supportive and upbeat. 

She fell off the wagon in September during a particularly tough month at work and has been smoking ever since. She called her doctor and got prescribed Chantix, but there is currently a Chantix recall, meaning that is not an option right now. 

She talks about wanting to quit before November when her family comes but I am struggling to see how. Without the Chantix I am nervous about her falling off the boat, as the first few weeks of nicotine withdrawal are insanely tough. Additionally, it seems like her triggers are coffee, drinking, and stress. She is not a heavy drinker so we both have decided to avoid bars as much as possible. With that being said, coffee goes hand in hand with cigarettes and she once spoke about getting her caffeine intake in another fashion. However, she is talking about buying a new coffee maker which is a bit confusing to me. I‚Äôm nervous as I don‚Äôt see her quitting while she continues to drink coffee. 

I have suggested exercise as a replacement, but she does not seem too eager to take that on right now. 

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable moving forward with the relationship if she continues to smoke. We have talked about this issue and she knows the cigarettes need to go, but I am struggling to see how when Chantix is not available, there is a new coffee maker in the house, and exercise is not a priority. I‚Äôm not trying to tell her what to do, but I do not feel comfortable getting serious with someone who smokes regularly. Should I have another conversation about this? Should I trust her to quit and just be supportive? What would help us both be on the same page here?

I am unfamiliar with nicotine addiction so any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all!

"Hi, I have a surgery coming up in 30 days and I need to be nicotine free. My wife is a smoker so quitting cold turkey wasn't working for me, so I decided to try an herbal cigarette called Southern Tipps to alleviate some of the habit. The Southern tipps are advertised to be tobacco and nicotine free and I have been using them for 7 days now all the while reducing the amount of smoking but I'm still not passing the home nicotine tests that I purchased. I'm curious if anyone else has tried the southern tipp cigarettes to cut out nicotine prior to surgery? And if they are fully nicotine free as advertised.",stopsmoking

"When does the emotional rollercoaster end with quitting smoking? Can anyone offer advice for past 3 months or up to?

I've never gotten farther in a quit because of the emotional stress I seem to be under from quitting. Alan Carr says it's not real but I find it hard to believe him. The trouble is I'm so irrationally and strongly irritated, angry or depressed during this time in the quit. I'm a different person and I don't like who this person is. And this is why I've failed in the past around the 3 month mark. Can anyone offer advice on the strong emotions they experience? Do we just struggle through it and hope for the best and wait until, if this is the worst, to be over?

No more dumb ass cover the smoker smell off me tactics that probably don't even work. No more hugging my kid and wondering if he'll remember me smelling like an ash tray (or the imagery of me smoking). No more jeopardizing my future for myself and as a parent! No more heavy trash feelings in my chest. No more settling to solve my agitation with a cigarette. No more mental time clocks that now I should smoke because I haven't in a few hours even if I don't even want one, but smoking anyways. No more romanticizing that being a smoker is the way to be social, (like it's some testament to being a jaded philosophical artist of some sort). No more stained teeth. No more feeling shameful when I smoke and having to walk extra far away from nonsmokers to have a cigarette. No more wasting money.

Getting sun flower seeds, and some Werther's caramel candy's. I'm anticipating being a bitch and I'm probably gonna cry. One thing I learned after multiple quits, do not have the one smoke. It will seriously bring you back right where you were before. I can almost guarantee it. Just isn't worth it. Especially when u get past the bullshit of the first few weeks. Save yourself if you can.

" For context i am M[19] and I started smoking  4 years ago. Until last year i smoked occasionally , with friends never alone. Last year a big exam was approaching and i stareted smoking from 2-4 ciggars per day. After the passing the exam with flying colours, i started going out , and when i paired alchool and cigars i smoked 2 packs.

In the last month i started  to ask myself if i am an addict. First try to quit was bad. I was felling tinglig in my toes and becouse i was very anxious i stared fearing that i had ALS and after that i started smoking again. Now i am 2 weeks in and i swear i will never pick up smoking again. The withdrawal is horrible . First week my anxiety was ten time worst then the first time i tried quiting. I had heart problems related to anxiety and i was telling myself i was going to die. Now after 2 weeks my anxiety calmed down a bit and my heart rate is back to normal. Sometimes i have headaches and anxiety bursts ( most of them centered around my health) but i know they will pass . This sub helped me a lot geting through the first week.

"Hi guys!

Im smoke free for 1 week now, and its surprisingly easy. I was a smoker for 14 years. I used patches for the first 3 days, and then nothing. I dont even think of cigarettes at all tbh, but i have one or two cravings per day, but not that intense. The main reason i stopped smoking now (i planned stopping for a while, i reall hated it) that ive been to spain for two weeks now, amd smoking is forbidden everywhere, so if i wanted to smoke i had to stand up, walk away and smoke at the street instead of the bar, or restaurant, and i found that very disturbing and socially stigmatized. I couldnt even smoke at the airport on my way back, although i had to get there 3 hours before take off, so that was a test itself.
Since then i run every day, today i ran 5K and my lungs are amazing now, its more clear already, so if you plan to give up smokeing do it!!",stopsmoking
"Exactly one year ago I posted here that I was quitting smoking. I did really well for about 2 months, felt amazing, and was really proud of myself. Then as the same old story goes, I was having a drink with a friend who was smoking and I thought, sure, Ill have one. Well, here I am a year later starting over... again. Something about the fall equinox makes me feel change. I am embarrassed to tell friends and family because a)they smoke or b) they think I can't/won't do it. If I did tell them I think they would be thinking, ok here we go again! As a reference my oldest son is about the same age I was when I started smoking. I cringe to admit  it was over 20 years ago! It is something I have always done whether in joy or sorrow. Sure, I have quit for long periods of time, but seem to always find my way back. I feel compelled to say some days a barely smoke at all, 2 or 3. Drinking is a big trigger that requires much smoking.

But a series of highly stressful events in the past 2 months (work stress, pandemic stress etc) has made me turn to alcohol to help ease the edge. I've increased from binging over the weekends to near daily drinks. Cravings for cigarettes have started again but they're no longer easily accessible. But my alcohol cabinet is pretty well-stocked.

"I always thought quitting smoking wpuld be impossible for me - I smoked for 20 years (the majority of my life), when I quit I was smoking about 12 a day. 

What helped me quit:

Well first of all, some person on this sub wrote a comment about a quiz to see if you are ready to quit on this app QuitSure. I downloaded the app to take this quiz and well, guess I was ready because 10 days later I smoked my last cigarette. So thanks random commenter, you and this creepy app literally saved my life. 

Seriously I can not recommend QuitSure enough and no, I'm not here for promo. It's free. It works. I've had few to no cravings since I quit, though a few fleeting urges especially the first few days. 
 
Other things that helped: flexible working hours so I could get up and run around the block/do yoga/meditate as needed. My jump rope was crucial the first week. I stopped coffee for 2 weeks and switched to tea and yoga in the morning. The entire Sia discography got me through some rough moments - I swear every Sia song is about quitting smoking. And CBD - the first 4 days I smoked 1 or 2 CBD cigarettes and I still smoke it with some weed as I used to roll joints with tobacco. Yes, the weed has helped too. 

Also I have been alone this entire time - we are moving and my spouse is already in the new house while I stay to pack and finish work. The isolation has been helpful as no triggers (spouse still smokes) and when I was going through the bowels of hell known as Day 3 no one was here to make me even crankier. 

The changes I've noticed:
First week - insane brain fog, I was completely useless but other than that felt super empowered and confident with myself. Worked out basically all day - yoga, pilates, running, jump rope. Got some quit zits. Had no appetite so just ate fruit and nuts and olives and juice amd digestion was PK.  

Week 2 - super constipated which wasn't so much of an issue week 1. Got some depression but I'm bipolar so was expecting much worse (mood has been pretty hypomanic otherwise, but honestly I think the hypo helped me quit).  Then came the hemmerhoids and eczema. My gums and lips got super sore and started cracking and swelling. Body got warmer which is weird but I'm less cold now. Skim started glowing. Exercise and breathing much easier. Hacking up brown stuff too but was actually pretty satisfying.

Week 3 - still constipated, laxatives for breakfast every day. Started coffee again but still no alcohol. Mood stable and can run 10 minutes now! Eczema going away but some blood when I blow my nose. Lips and gums way better. Concentration slowly returning...and feeling proud AF. 


The best for me was QuitSure, exercise, and CBD as needed. I'll probably bring the CBD with me to parties as drinking is when I usually cave. It also really helped with relaxation and sleep. 

I hope I'm able to help someone on this sub quit as one of you did for me. Good job everyone that has done it :) And if you haven't yet, download QuitSure and check out that module to see if you're ready.",stopsmoking

This shit is definitely not easy but I've been on the patch since I quit and haven't had any relapses. My only concern is quality of sleep: I quickly realized that the patch was giving me fucked up dreams, so I started taking it off before bed.

No vivid dreams since then, but my sleep habits have definitely changed. I used to be a \*very\* deep sleeper. Since I kicked the habit, I go to bed very early, and wake up at fucking 6am.

I know, it sounds dumb and like I'm romanticizing the whole thing, but I truly loved smoking. Hell, friends used to joke that I was the smoking advocate.

"Hi guys,

Please excuse any formatting issues, while I am not new to lurking here, I am to posting.

So, ten years of smoking. Started off in college while drinking - always bumming smokes and never buying any (super annoying to all the smokers out there, yes).  After college...bigger jobs, bigger relationships, bigger problems...more smoking.

I have had the opportunity to work all over the world with my career and also the honour of paying the wildly different waccy tabbacy prices along the way. Didn't matter if it was $5 in California (10 years ago?) or $30 in Adelaide (not so long ago....), I always paid. Im now in Canada and dutifully shell out $18 - at least 3/4 times a week- before to the nice lady at the Chevron down the street. 

Now let talk about the lighters. THE LIGHTERS. Im sure Ive spent $1000 on shitty bic lighters of all colours in my in lifetime. Half of which my washing machine ate and the other half of which can no longer be accounted for. Gone forever. RIP.

SO, 7 days, 12 hours and 35 minutes without a shitty cig at this point.

"I've been taking nicotine in various forms for the past 8 years. First 5 years - cigarettes, 5th-7th year - vape with occasional cigs, past year - glo. Averaging at around 15 cigs per day. I'm male, 28 and have an addictive personality.

It's been over 3 days and it goes paradoxically fine. No urges, no cravings, no nothing. Granted, I was eating a lot this weekend, was figuratively raping my fridge all the day long like there is no tomorrow.
Also, I feel that my temper has been shortened a lot, every single thing around triggers some primal rage in me and I believe I have some problems concentrating while doing some work.

But with all of that I feel a lot of energy, confidence, motivation and sometimes pure euphoria that outweighs the negatives.
And the most important thing is that deep inside I honestly don't feel the need for the cig. I mean I do realize that nicotine will lift some of those withdrawal symptoms but somehow I don't even feel the need to rationalize that smoking a cig will be only temporal solution. I genuinely don't feel the need for the nicotine.

What's interesting, I've already tried quitting. In contrast to the story above, I went cold turkey for half a year about 3 years ago. First two weeks were pure hell, every night getting myself to sleep was a challenge, I was not just sweating, I was melting in my bed, with my hands shaking, and for every damn second my mind was occupied with the one and only thought - ""I cannot do this any longer, I have to find some cigs.""

For some reason, second attempt is going much smoother. Maybe, that's because I mostly switched from cigs to vape/glo, but I felt no discomfort upon switching, had no withdrawals. So at that time I assumed vape/glo won't help me with quitting as the nicotine intake remained the same.

I also had several trips on acid in which I had a thought that's it's time to stop smoking. Well, not just a thought, a complete serious internal conversation, how pretentious wouldn't that sound. There are some cases you can find in the internet where LSD made a huge impact in battling addiction, mostly alcohol. Maybe it worked for me either.

The thing is, I'm so mad at myself. I quit this habit several years ago and it was extremely difficult. I want to stop but I just end up going out and buying another pack. No one knows I've started and I want to stop before anyone finds out. 

The general shitty feeling I have about starting smoking again almost makes me want to smoke more - I'm stressed about starting smoking so I smoke to attempt to relieve that stress. 

It never works. I wish I could stop. I'm so angry at myself. I have mental health issues and that makes it even more difficult.

I can't stop smoking. Part of it is I'm a suicidal nihilist and I want to die. The other part is the obvious addiction. I also genuinely enjoy it.

I'm thinking hypnosis might be the way to go because nicotine seems to be the one thing I have no self-control over (this is coming from someone who used to do opiates, alcohol, benzos and cocaine on a daily basis). I don't do any of those anymore, just marijuana and occasionally alcohol, but I am just having the hardest time kicking nicotine. I have even quit in the past, but that's mostly because I had things to look forward to when I wake up and life in general. That is not the case anymore. My life fucking sucks. I hate my job. My social circle sucks. My friends are all assholes and I don't really want to spend time with them. Also, I just got diagnosed with scoliosis and my car was stolen. Everything around every corner is fucking shit so why bother quitting smoking. Before you start saying some high horse shit, I'm already going to therapy and on medication, which is also used to quit smoking apparently but hasn't helped.

**Avoid Your Trigger**  
Think of the things or situations that trigger your smoking habit and try your best to avoid them. It might be a party or hanging out with certain friends; try to find your escape route. If such situations trigger your habit, then try leaving the place for 1 minute.  


**Practice Relaxation Techniques**  
Quitting smoking is not easy; you have to go through the stress that makes it hard to stop. For this, you can practice various relaxation techniques. When the craving hits, you take a deep breath and take a journey in your mind.

Life is stressful, more so than it has been in a long time. Not just because of quitting smoking, but everything else going on in my life is making it very difficult for me.

I finally threw away my last bit of tobacco, so maybe I'm feeling the loss now too. Holding onto it was sort of comforting, and now I feel panicked.

Today at 3 o'clock will be one entire week smoke free. I juggled between smoking and vaping for three years and I am fully ready to move on to a happy, healthier life. I hit 18 months alcohol and weed free and it made me question the fact I was still vaping. One week ago, I slapped on a patch and many pieces of gum later, I hit my first goal.

"Today's marks 11 days since I quite smoking.
I am not having any cravings at all.
The first 7 days were hell. The first  2 - 4 days were the most intense for me by far. 

I had tremors on the 2nd &amp; 3rd day which was scary as hell but it was over quickly, haven't had any since. I also had small episodes of blurry vision/double vision which was over by day 4. I felt I'll, had shortness of breath and a burny sensation in my chest- at this point I was convinced I might have gotten Covid but thank goodness I did not.

Then from day 5 I started to get bloated and started farting alot, like long extended farts that smelled terrible and still do.

Today is my 11th day and the farts tend to be around the evening and my belly is still bloated, I've been making a point of exercising for 45minutes minimum everyday for the last 2 days and plan on keeping at it to prevent unnecessary weight gain; I've also started eating more plant based now since I have more money to spend on healthier options. 

I'm a bit puzzled as to how I am having large bowel movements twice a day, every day. No constipation at all and I'm not eating more. I have a substantial breakfast then a smaller lunch and a salad and protein for supper. Where is all this poo coming from? And it smells like something's crawled up and died in me everytime. Howlong does this last?

Anyone else having larger, stinkier and more frequent poos?",stopsmoking
"So, I'm a 32 years old male, smoker for more than half of my life, I started at 12... I did quit 2 times for 1 year each time so that means I smoked for around 18 years?

"So‚Ä¶ I started vaping no nicotine vape juice when I was 14. Then high school started and it seemed like everyone had 3mg nicotine vape juice so I decided to do the same. Then I was 16. I hit my first juul after vaping only 3mg and godDAMN I felt brain cells die I was so dizzy I kind of fell in love with the buzz after that. Then I had a day where my dad tackled me so I went from 6mg to 12mg. I remember being so stomach sick but the buzz really took the edge of. Then 18 hit, I‚Äôd be smoking cigarettes, my friend showed me a way to take the filter out and smoke with only half the filter. I now just turned 21 and I‚Äôm really looking back thinking I hurt my brain and caused damaged. I quit all together for 2 days and I remember how much better I felt and looked.

"So, hear me out: when I started my quit one week ago, I'd already been trying to quit for a week+. Around the same time I also went back to eating whole food plant based. Without getting on a soap-box, I eat plants with as little processing as possible, high starch, high fiber, low fat and low salt, no refined oils or sugars. I think this has **REALLY** helped me a quit, and here's why:

¬∞ This way of eating gets you hydrated -- eating meat and meat by-products will dehydrate you, not to mention all the salt. Water helps flush out residual nicotine and supports **ALL** those  bodily systems smoking has punished all these years -- plus, staying hydrated just makes you feel better overall

¬∞ The standard American diet is full of oils, sodium and sugar that (yes, will dehydrate you,  but also!) push your dopamine receptors like they were buttons on a game controller, which will ignite your cigarette cravings. Eating this way doesn't give you that same sensation and, for me, seemed to help abate the intensity of the post-meal craving.   
(Side-note: devious nicotine addiction 'knows' that our bodies' digestive absorption rates sky rocket post-meal, allowing more of the cigarette to be absorbed quicker -- supposedly, one after meal cigarette is worse than smoking 10 cigarettes).

¬∞ Finally, it'll help the healing process while giving you confidence.  Eating this way gives your body a ton of nutrient dense foods rather than calorie dense foods, so your body gets what it needs (helping it heal). And honestly, it'd be really hard to gain weight while eating this way. In fact my first week I lost five pounds just eating potatoes, rice, veggies, fruit, and beans. That really gave me a nice confidence boost during the times I was feeling weak or just down on myself. 

Even if you don't change your whole diet, I would bet just eating more veggies and fruits and less meat and fats would really help you deal with the first few weeks of stopping. 

I hope this helps! Good luck and stick to the stop!",stopsmoking

"So I'm a 27 yo male from Scandinavia, I've been snusing and smoking for 10 years. (For those of you who don't know what snus is, It's like american dip, only way stronger nicotine levels) And I've tried quitting 3 times this year and I finally snapped this weekend. I couldn't take it anymore.    


I've made it 3 months free using a combination of chantix and nicotine-free snus, or using a piece of ginger under my lips to get the burning sensation. I also used heavy painkillers the first week to up my dopamine levels which helped a lot with cravings, although I am not endorsing recreational drug use, I have a pescription for back pain. Also, quitting at a time when I had low stress levels in my life helped a lot.  


If you want to know made me cave in, then continue reading. It might help some of you fellow quitters to get some perspective maybe.   


So here's the thing, I recently moved to a new place to study. On a remote island in the middle of nowhere, I don't know anyone here, there is basicaly no one in my age group at the school, so I don't socialize much. There's nothing to do besides the usual A4 life, a lot of dead air, waiting for the bus and other boredoms. I've also been in quarantine for 10 days because I got Covid, and to make the isolation even worse I'm not even allowed a pet where I live. So hello Marlboro my old friend, I've come to talk to you again...  


The boredom and isolation isn't the only thing that triggered me, It's also the fact that the irritability that comes from withdrawal never seems to go away for me, and the only thing that calms my anger is nicotine. So I just went and bought a six pack and a pack of cigarettes this Friday, because I snapped at a student and a teacher, and I figured it can't be like this. If this is how it's supposed to be then what's the point of quitting at all? snapping at people and and having a burning rage that lasts for months... nah...   


I'm on my second pack now, I don't feel very addicted however they do calm me down. Does the anger ever go away?",stopsmoking

My body smells disgusting though. It‚Äôs like I can smell the detox coming out of my skin.

Internally I‚Äôm a bit of a mess. I keep thinking about painful life experiences, some recent and some from years ago. But overall it‚Äôs good to have some sort of feelings again because I was always just numbing myself out by puffing away instead of dealing with anything.

I‚Äôm lucky that I‚Äôm in a situation where I can afford to just focus on quitting and not focus on anything else.

I‚Äôm going for insanely long walks because I just feel restless. Exploring the area. Mostly keeping to myself.

"I don't miss it, and don't even remember I used to smoke unless it comes up somehow. 

My best advice is to keep trying and don't give up no matter how many times you ""fail"" at quitting. I switched from buying packs to rolling my own sometime late last year, and I threw away my rolling supplies upwards of 5 times before I quit for good; and I don't regret it. I might have wasted a lot of money re-buying the rolling supplies when I caved, but it worked as extra incentive to kick the habit because after the 3rd time it's impossible to ignore how absurd this addiction yo-yo is. 

Be kind to yourself, even when you mess up. Note all the little signs of progress, including the way you're thinking about smoking and quitting. A lot of the time, the way you're mentally framing smoking and quitting is more important. 

The biggest thing for me was just accepting I was going to be more miserable for a while. And that's hard to accept when life is a struggle already. But just going in knowing that quitting is going to lead to moodiness, headaches, stress, brain fog, and tiredness helped me to handle all those things. 

Initially, I was so *scared* of the effects of quitting that I didn't want to try it. But once I just embraced the idea, like ""yeah I am just going to be less-than-peak for a couple weeks,"" things got a lot better. It meant my expectations for myself in any given situation needed to be different while I was quitting. I couldn't expect myself to be at 100% during the withdrawl period, so I didn't. I went to work and gave it everything I had...considering my brain felt like it was buried under 10 layers of cotton. I napped a *lot* because sleeping was just better than being awake. I went for a lot of walks because aerobic exercise helped with the stress and the headaches. When I ate fast food as a coping mechanism I didn't beat myself up over it, just took time to notice how upset it made my stomach and acknowledged it really only added to my list of general ills.

Overall I just tried to be really kind to my body. That was hard for me, as obviously smoking is quite *unkind* to the body and I had to confront and acknowledge just how much I'd been physically harming myself with smoking, as well as realize that for various reasons I personally struggle with being kind to myself. So that was something I needed to learn, and a mental muscle I needed to exercise. Just a normal level of decency to ones own flesh--what does that look like? What do I want that to look like? How does that *feel*, in my body? 

I treated quitting as a physiological and psychological process with actionable steps and obtainable goals. I studied the physical effects of nicotine withdrawal and mentally prepared for the effects and their timelines. I used an app that tracked what my blood and lungs and heart were experiencing without cigarettes (quittracker, but there's tons of others). Knowing the science-facts about what was happening to me physiologically helped reassure me that no matter what I was experiencing in my head, this was normal as a reaction to quitting and I needed to keep it in perspective that it wasn't a permanent change to my experience of existing. 


I didn't titrate down or use assistance drugs or slowly taper my use; I just quit cold turkey over and over again until it stuck, and in the meantime I tried to work on habits of kindness towards myself--both in my thinking and in my behavior. As I exercised my self-kindness/compassion muscles, I was more readily able to face the symptoms of withdrawl and grind through the 2 weeks of symptoms and 4 weeks of habit building necessary to enforce a lasting change. 

So to anyone else working to quit, good luck and be kind to yourself. It's hard and you deserve compassion no matter what part of the journey you're at. Remember that growth and progress are not linear but cyclical, and you've gained something new from each cycle you've gone through.",stopsmoking
"The last couple of days not only have the cravings been intense,  but I am so grumpy and easily irritable. I‚Äôm sad and feeling negative thoughts about myself, my body, who I am.

"I started smoking at the age of 14.  At first to catch a buzz with friends.  Within a year, I was at nearly a pack a day.  Eventually I got to a little over a pack a day and continued that way through my wife giving birth to 3 kids, and for the next 21 years of my life.  Eventually reached the point where I smoked more years of my life than not.  
In 2012 I tried quitting using Chantix.  Luckily it was covered under my insurance.  It seemed to do a decent enough job but gave me the weirdest dreams and some awful nightmares.  I never fully quit while taking Chantix and stopped taking it, which lead me to smoking full force again.  
At this point, it was more troublesome.  I didn't smoke in the car with my kids, so a car ride was something like this; Smoke just before getting the the car.  If the trip was under an hour, I would smoke as soon as we got to where we were going.  If it was longer, i would take a smoke break about every hour.  This left me smelling of smoke sometimes and making my wife car-sick from the smell and the motion of driving.  
It got to the point where I was concerned about cancer and what my future would be like and wondering if my kids would pick up the habit.  I tried to quit a couple more times without telling anyone, so that if I failed, only I would know.    
My buddy quit and went to vaping.  He tried to get me to vape, and that lasted maybe a couple months, but I still smoked actual cigarettes.  It didn't help me.  
One day, in June of 2013, I had just left Bo'Jangles for lunch.  As any smoker knows, you have to have a smoke right after eating.  As soon as I got in my truck, I fired up the after lunch cigarette.  I immediately got a headache and as I was sitting there, I could see the nicotine stains across my windshield from the glare of the sun.  I asked myself, ""Why am I still doing this?""  
I took my cigarette, my pack, my lighter and tossed them all in the trash can.  I drove home, tossed my remaining carton in the trash, told my wife I was done smoking.  I went on FaceBook and announced that I was quitting.  That way I would be held accountable.  
The next 2-3 months were rough.  I kept trying to convince myself to just get one last pack.  Smoke one last cigarette.    
I started slicing carrots and celery and putting them in baggies to much on when the impulse to smoke came on.  People often don't think about the 'hand-to-mouth' motion being habitual and a hard thing to drop.  So people often lead to excessive snacking as a coping mechanism.  
I made smoking my enemy this time.  Looked at is as an entity that was trying to kill me.  I hated it.  After about a year, the smell would turn my stomach.  I could smell the person in front of me at a stop light if they were smoking.  Going into stores where an employee had just gotten back from a smoke break.  That smell.  It was nauseating.   
For nearly 2 years I kept having dreams that I smoked or bought a pack and fired one up.  I would wake up angry thinking it really happened, then sigh in relief that it was just a dream.  
It has now been 8.5 years.  I have officially been a non-smoker longer than a smoker again.  I have been alive for 43 years and smoked only 21 of them.  It was oddly depressing to know that for about 7 years, I was a smoker longer than I was not.  Now, that has been reversed.  
My buddy who quit smoking by vaping, is still vaping.  After all these years.  Vaping as much as he did 8 years ago.  I am proud to say I haven't cracked.  Not even once.  Not even a puff, since I quit on June 12th, 2013.  
It's possible.  I'm not a man of great feats.  I have no super powers.  I am as average as they come.  If I can do it, I think you can do it.  It's hard.  It takes determination.  It is well worth it in the long run.  
I'm saving over $5 a day, which I've put toward a hobby.  I'm not passing down a terrible, life-altering habit to my kids.  My wife likes kissing me again (she never smoked).  I don't smell like an ashtray anymore.  My fingertips aren't yellow with nicotine stains anymore.

As I went past my daily limit that I had set for myself, I understood that this is a killer substance to hold onto. Keeping the story until here. As I'm writing this after smoking the last bud in my packet, I've decided to take a break from this at least until Christmas. I live in India and it is not at all easy for a chap like me to sober up for even three months. It's easily available around and every medium glorifies the use of ciggerates here.

"Hi all. 

Really seeking some advice here. I've been a heavy tobacco smoker for roughly six years (I'm 25 now), and only in the past 7 weeks have I been exclusively on the vape (strength 18mg, chain-vaping all day). After deciding to give that one up a few days ago, the symptoms have been nothing short of debilitating...

Aside from the obvious discomfort, the main point of contention is these crazy mood swings I've never experienced before, and insomnia. I honestly hadn't cried in close to 10 years, until yesterday. Full on tears, blubbering, runny nose.  

I cannot for the life of me sleep. I am utterly restless and feel as though I'm always on the verge of tears. I'm crazy emotional right now and want to know when, or if, the mist should begin to clear. 

Really hoping that this isn't going to be my default state of mind from now on, because if it is and smoking was just suppressing these emotions, I would rather go back on them to be honest.

I need a reason to trudge on and I'm struggling to find one.

I quit all my other vices FIRST this time because usually me needing a substitute for smoking would cause all kinds of bad behaviour or replacements.

So this time I‚Äôm quitting and just coping through the withdrawal.

Now I can‚Äôt sleep though. I have a ton of energy, acid reflux, I‚Äôm feeling pain everywhere in my body‚Ä¶

The cigarette withdrawal has never been this bad before, maybe because I‚Äôd usually drink while quitting IDK.

I also feel emotional but also alive. I feel all sweaty and shaky on the outside and my skin is oily‚Ä¶but I also feel clean and energized which seems paradoxical because I also feel exhausted.

Rollercoaster!

I just hope this levels out sooner rather than later.

This time I‚Äôm also taking tons of vitamins and supplements as well as an acid reducer because I always get GERD when I‚Äôm quitting and I‚Äôm taking probiotics too because quitting normally gives me the runs for some reason.

I am sucking on nicotine lozenges as well but in moderation and I have to keep spitting them out anyway because they start to make me feel sick after about 5 minutes of sucking on them.

"My boyfriend is trying to quit smoking and it has been about a week since he quit. We are currently in a long distance relationship and he is on the other side of the world, so time differences are already a strain. However, with him having quit smoking, all he wants to do is sleep or play video games because that's the only way he knows how to deal with his cravings. He sleeps for about 12 hours a day and is constantly taking sleeping pills because he would rather be asleep than awake.

I'm trying not to be selfish and I know that he is having a rough time, but I am also having a rough time because I feel like there is a lack of attention to the relationship and spending time together because he is focusing so hard on trying to keep his cravings at bay. I have never smoked so I don't really understand what it feels like to quit. I'm really proud of him for trying and I want to see him be successful.

"So, around this time last Saturday, I extinguished the last cigarette I will ever smoke. One thing that helped me was to name the various feelings, discomforts, and urges because what can be named can be understood. 

It helped to classify the different experiences into three camps: withdraws, cravings, suggestions. So, when I'd feel physical pressure in my head after a meal and my subconscious mind would push ""cigarette"" through my brain, I could dissect each different, smaller part and deal with them individually rather than as some monolithic monster.

For the last few days, the withdraws are mild,  cravings are getting more and more sparse, and the suggestions are inconsistent and weak.

However! Yesterday and today I've noticed a different kind of prompt, and I wonder if ya'll have had it too. This is clearly under the suggestion classification, but it's not overt. I find myself feeling like something is missing, something is not present and I feel incomplete. 

So, I have coffee but I'm not satisfied with it because it lacks something that leaves me feeling not-whole. The same with eating, driving, etc.

I notice it most when I'm not in the moment: when I'm just mindlessly consuming my coffee one giant slurp at a time. I'm going to try to be more mindful, to find the 'new things""  about my drinks, meals,  etc that smoking deprived me of noticing in order to combat this subtle suggestion that is disrupting my peace.

"29M, started smoking ""casually"" at 16, and daily from 18 till now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on my second read of Allen Carr's Easyway. I read it about 4 or 5 years ago and loved it, it really made me rethink my relationship with cigarettes. In fact, I don't think I've ever truly ""enjoyed"" a cigarette since then, but I never stopped smoking, not even for a day.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm reading it now through a more adult lens, I came across this paragraph:

&amp;#x200B;

 ""Ask  a smoker who believes he smokes only because he enjoys the taste and smell of tobacco,  'If you cannot get your normal brand of cigarette and can only obtain a brand you find  distasteful, do you stop smoking?' No way. A smoker will smoke old rope rather than  abstain, and it doesn't matter if you switch to roll- ups, mentholated cigarettes, cigars or a  pipe; to begin with they taste awful but if you persevere you will learn to like them. Smokers will  even try to keep smoking during colds, flu, sore throats, bronchitis and emphysema.  ""

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm realizing that, no matter how much I've thought about the nicotine addiction and brainwashing, and actually AGREE with all of that, I NEVER have those thoughts or attitude when the craving hits. No matter how strongly I believe in that, and how I'm craving to be free from this shit forever, and I know the smell and taste and feeling are downright disgusting, I always end up lighting up another cigarette. This would be more ""excusable"" if it happened in social settings, but no. I can't go more than an hour without smoking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I run out of tobacco and it all becomes very clear: I just need to NOT buy more. I won't smoke if I don't have them readily available, I feel better already now that I don't HAVE to smoke another one. While I'm losing myself in these thoughts, some part of my brain (nicotine addiction) is already driving me to the store. 

&amp;#x200B;

How. The. Hell. Does. Anyone. Do. This. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the nicotine withdrawal itself is ""mild"", according to the book, then that leaves me with the psychological part of addiction. It is so strong, my tolerance for frustration is so low, that I can't even imagine myself without smoking, it's my crutch for everything, particularly boredom and stress. I fully understand what the book says about this, smoking to relieve anxiety is a paradox. However, these argumentos have little to no effect the moment the thought of smoking pops in my mind.

"I've been smoking since I was about 16. At the age of 35 I quit for two years, then started for about two years again and then in Dec 19 I quit again. 6 months later I also quit caffeine and 3 months after that I started experiencing morning wood and spontaneous erections during the day like never before.

Hey guys. I have been smoking since I was 13, I am 18 now. In December 2019 I quit smoking and moved to snus, nicotine pouch. I hated myself for continuing the worst path; however, my craving was too strong. I always told myself when I move to Canada, I will quit as there is no snus here. I came to Canada and wasted what I had left of snus. I was ready. The first day without snus I got huge cravings and I was feeling sick. I tried to distract myself by smoking weed but it only made it worse. I became emotional and hysterical. I could not stop crying and having suicidal thoughts. Not having any friends in Canada did not help so I turned to the one thing I finally got rid of, cigarettes. I bought a pack and told myself it would be my last. It has been 6 days since I said that, I have smoked 5 and a half packs ever since. I need help, I fucking need it. What do I do? I am scared. I do not want to ruin my life and I do not want to smoke any more. I thought I was strong enough, it turns out I am a weak coward. 

I am not only addicted to the nicotine but to the fact that it was always my escape.

Me again. Former pack-a-day smoker. Managed to quit for somewhere around 50 days in 2019, blew it on some stupid nonsense, but I'm ready this time. I'm ready for real. I've been excited for every leg down in nicotine.

I'm ready to be done with this, I'm ready to stop romaniticizing smoking and making it a part of my personality. I'm going to hit 0mg, throw the vape away, hit the exercise bike and turn this shit around.

"it started with a party last week. havent been to one in like forever. i quit everything for close to half a year.

i was sitting there with a friend of mine, convinced i wouldnt get myself a beer, thinking to myself what the fuck am i doing here:

Im young, in university, friends are around and places are opening up again.

and im here, the most boring person at the location, judging people for having fun.

one beer led to another and irresitable cravings took over me and i got myself a cigarette from someone. 

and another one.

and we lit up a hookah.

it was so much fun being back with friends. this evening was so much needed.

all good i thought. not a big deal. i treated myself once. i have deserved this.

a friend of mine invited me for the next day to go drinking.
hell yeah i thought. i was craving social connection so badly.

humans need social connection. i dont think its healthy to life in total abstinence. always 'husteling'

would have been real fucking valuable for me to hustle on because of so much wasted time in my teens due to some problemes and a huge problem with substance absue.

i was on such a successful way.

but this is still not the point were it got problematic again.

the next day comes around. met with my friend and a few others. drank some beery some harder stuff and my smoking totally escalated that night.

asked one stranger after the other for a cigarette. anybody i could find to ask. didnt even look them in the eyes anymore only on there hands if their holding one.

still this isnt the point where it got problematic.

what really got problematic is that i crossed the barrier of lighting my hookah up at my place every possible second while at home ever since.

its even at that point again where i think to myself that i dont want it, i get headaches, my lungs hurt and i dont get shit done but my stupid addicted brain only needs like 5 minutes to change its mind and i prepare another head.

so...

i feel bad. not too bad bit i know what im doing is not good at all.

i think the biggest problem is that i dont hate i enough to see the bad side of it yet.

nicotine addiction got its grip back on me in less than 2 days.

i know what it feels like. the mental aspect of not wanting it but still doing it and the physical sensation of nicotine withdrawl.

its back

tomorrow im back awake, and my mind is gonna trick me into consuming again.

i know none of your comments will stop me from doing so. only i can stop myself.

the reason i consume is because i cant stand be be left alone with my thoughts when i know theres something more pleasurable whitch distracts me from my pain.

but i will embrace the pain. i love pain.

pain makes a man

i pushes me forward to new hights.

to reach impossible achievements and no fucking stupid useless substance is gonna stop me from doing so.

i want more from live than numbing pain with substances and being chained to my addiction.

i got a new therapist with whom i hopefully be able to work with successfully.

as much as i wish luck to myself i do wish it for you.

this is gonna be hard again but i will overfome this annoying sensation of withdrawl.

mostly need to work on how to connect with other young people without consuming. but its everywhere and im so fucking lonely and unhappy about how hard it is to spend time with other young people and not consume any kind of substance. feel like im missing out of so much fun only to realise the night out was totally annoying and not fun and i have to spend a whole day hungover and a full week tired and waste time and so on. i want to build value now i harvest my compound interest achievements in the future. hopefully i will be able to do so.",stopsmoking

"I was a smoker for 6.5 years, pack a day for 3 years. First 2 weeks were a hell of a ride for me, but I made a huge path in these 3 weeks in a matter of dealing with my own emotions and I feel good now.

Because nicotine is a drug. It's weak, but if you always smoke its effect is permanent. You are in a constant clouded state of mind, you do have distinct emotions, but cigarettes blur them in one big goo. That's why I smoked, actually. I had a lot of negative feelings and emotions that I wanted to blur, I wanted to literally smoke (make less vivid) them.

But if you always smoke you can't deal with them and make they go through, you just try to hide them, so they always stay there, making your life worse, always keeping your level of psychological stress at a pretty high point. Cigarettes just help you to have a constant emotional constipation. I wasn't ready to deal with myself sober even 6 months ago, but now I realize that it's way better to stay sober. I just don't like that clouded head space no more. It takes time for your psyche to learn to process sober emotions, but it's worth it.

"As much as I'd want to say that being so close to a year milestone has made it easier to stay off of cigarettes, it hasn't. The first month was rough and I was irritable and anxious all the time, made it feel like I wouldn't get past it. But as time went on it did get easier for some time, even past the 6 month streak I was pretty amazed with myself and surprised that I had made it that long. Around a month ago I started struggling with anxiety on a more regular basis. I lost my job in July and I started taking some online classes a couple weeks ago but during that period between not working and not occupying my time with anything I started to feel the urge to go back to smoking really bad. I've struggled with bouts of anxiety before and usually when I did, the cigarettes were always there for me. Being a smoker for 10+ years they felt like they became a part of my identity. It always felt like a crutch that could ground me and bring me back to reality when I was having excessive worry or intrusive thoughts. Dealing with my anxiety this time around has been more sobering and difficult because I now always have the thought in my mind that I should just go buy a pack and start smoking, to see if that helps. There's other things I find myself doing that I didn't feel necessary when I started quitting like chewing more gum or putting a toothpick in my mouth. Sometimes I'll just go out on the porch and pretend like I'm smoking but just get some air instead. I'll even act like I'm holding a cigarette sometimes. It's weird to think about how engrained that behavior of smoking became even though it's been almost a year since I had one, it's just lately I've been doing a lot of reminiscing on the times I was a smoker. I know it's a big illusion that the addiction created but it really feels like a part of me is gone with the cigarettes out of my life.

I've seen too many lung cancer patients coughing up blood and moaning in pain as they die a slow and painful death. I've seen to much judgement in the eyes of my fellow employees as they walk by me sucking down cigarettes, too many people have looked at me like I'm some sort of scum for doing it. I'm done letting this chemical have any sort of hold over me. I'm tired of feeling like a crazy person when I don't get a cigarette in every four hours. 

I've been smoke free, cold turkey for about 6.5 days now. I already feel like I can breathe better. I can taste food and coffee again. I can smell my own farts again. So far the biggest symptom has been that I feel less in control of my emotions. Maybe this is how I felt before I started smoking, and I was using nicotine to treat that in a way. I don't remember. Regardless, I am glad that my meds have enabled me to do this with minimal physical withdrawal symptoms after the first two days, besides my inability to sleep.

I'm also proud of myself, especially after today. I had to drive for 3+ hours today, and every part of me wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes before I left my home town. I found myself trying to rationalize it. ""Well, maybe I can make a rule where I only smoke when I have a long car trip, "" ""I'll throw the pack away when I get home""  but luckily I stopped myself.

In the evening I watch series on my laptop and browse the web but the very first thing on my mind when I wake up is thinking about smoking one and of course I need to smoke at least 2 or 3 before I go to bed. 

This has become so weird and I sure know how addiction feels like as I'm deep down into one. I tell myself every night before going to sleep that I'll quit the next day or at least reduce the number of cigarettes smoked but when I wake up the urge is strong. I'm tired of it and on the other hand I'm somehow used to being addicted and not doing anything all day but thinking about smoking and smoking. I could spend all day just listening to music while having a cigarette. 

Sometimes my teeth hurt and when I wake up in the morning or during the night to go to bathroom ( I'm 22 and I have the urge to pee almost every night or morning , might be because of cigarettes but I'm not sure ) sometimes I cough. Sometimes my ribs hurt.

Something's not quite right with me. I need help.

Thanks for reading",stopsmoking
I have been smoking for around 3-4 years and recently got sick. For the sake of my own health i decided to not smoke until i stop coughing and it was pretty easy because i felt like shit anyways. However now it is the third day and i am STRUGGLING really hard and trying to keep myself from getting a pack from the store. It just felt so good to not smoke for three days after these years and i feel like i might have a chance to quit for good as i tried but failed before. Any tips?,stopsmoking

"I read the book ""EasyWay by Aleen Car"" when I was in holiday in the beautiful country Montenegro. I've been there for a whole week in beautiful views when usually the need for smoking is the greatest. I managed to don't smoke even 1 cigarette while reading the book. then I got back to my country and was free for another 23 days. 

I smoked one cigarette at a best friend's wedding and I knew it might get me back. I didn't smoke for 2 hours there but then the CRAVE has win me and I smoked the cursed one.

5 days later and I'm finding myself stealing cigarettes from my brother. fast forward and I'm buying a Box.

I'm thinking about reading the book again but I feel like such a big Loser.

Please don't smoke this ""one and only"" !!  that you so want never ever!

I read online that after 3-6 months the craving for smoking will almost be gone. I'm so sorry I didn't wait for that. :(

The need to smoke will always find us even after 20 years. but much less than now.

Just wanted to share,

All the best and luck guys",stopsmoking
"I'm an ex smoker and I've come to the conclusion that tobacco should just be straight up banned from public sale. It's a blight on society and should become a thing of the past. There are literally zero positive aspects to selling tobacco apart from raising taxes.

"After 15 years of smoking I went completely cold turkey last November. Surprisingly I didn't have any cravings and giving up went way easier than expected. That was all until restrictions started easing up and I've found whenever I'm out drinking with friends who smoke I always cave at one point and have one or two. This has happened on three separate occasions. When drinking with non smokers I've no cravings whatsoever and don't want one.

I don't want to vape but should I bring one out for these specific occasions. Does anyone have any tips?",stopsmoking

"Day 20. It is still hard - i was born a smoker, screamed until 12 years old when I started smoking. And i did for another 12. At 24, I was a smoker for longer than i wasn‚Äôt. And i loved it. For so long. But I‚Äôve seen the reflection when I‚Äôm looking for them, the crazy eyes, the frantic movements, the irritability, the horrid feeling when you realise it is late, you‚Äôre out of them and everything is closed. The lengths one goes to. The wet hair smelling like death because you *had* to have one. The shitty excuses to leave, that everyone can see through. The burned clothes. The health damage. The subhumanity. It‚Äôs literally just cigarettes. It takes about 20 days to be out of the worst. I‚Äôm out of the worst. It is literally just a stinky habitual cancer stick, and I want to quit forever. It is a damn no brainer.

"I've tried to quit cold turkey in the past so many times. Buying a pack, smoking two or three, then throwing the pack and the lighter away. Going off the advice of Allen Carr, I was determined to just rip out that nicotine drip. But I kept coming back.

This might work for some people. But what I realised after trying and failing literally maybe 20 times was that I was sick of the *sensation* of smoking but not the nicotine. The need for a nicotine was the only thing bringing me back.

So I finally dropped a load of money (up-front) on a full course of nicotine patches plus gum. I thought of it as an investment that would save me so much money in the long run if it works.

I'm now five days in and haven't *once* wanted to smoke. Yesterday I even took the patch off for about 12 hours and still didn't want to smoke. Once the familiar 'pinched' feeling came (again, for a *nicotine* hit, not for smoke in my lungs), I slapped on another patch. The thought of smoking made me feel physically sick.

Here's my point: it's easy to think you're strong enough to quit cold turkey. I kept kidding myself that I could tackle both the psychological and physical addiction at once. But actually I needed to get used to a smoke-free life.

I'm already feeling the benefits. I can breathe better. I smell good. I can smell *things* (it was actually kind of an emotional, Proustian moment to walk into a supermarket on day 3 and actually *smell* the fruit and veg aisle). There are no longer dark rings under my eyes. I have more time. I'm happier. 

Without the nicotine cravings I can see the cigarettes for what they actually are - a filthy transmission method for a highly addictive substance.

Even if I'm still popping nicotine gum in the months, even years ahead, it's a much better option than actively poisoning myself. The reason that NRT is twice as effective is because it allows you to tackle the addiction by degrees. For all the good that the cold turkey method is supposed to do, I feel like the all-or-nothing approach isn't for everyone. Like any big problem, it can help to take it in smaller bites. At least, it seems to be working for me.",stopsmoking

Aspiring nonsmoker here. Been smoking for the past few years (25m) and I've had enough. I have tried to quit a dozen times and I always relapse (I think my longest streak is about 2 months). 

One of my friends recommended Zyn to me as a nicotine cessation product he found to be helpful. Zyn has been able to prevent me from buying smokes, but it seems like I've simply swapped my nicotine delivery mechanism without beating the addiction itself. 

Do you have any advice on what my next steps should be? I know the easy answer is probably to just quit Zyn and starve out the nicotine monster once and for all, but I'm having such a hard time. I can go a few days without nicotine but then my cravings for the buzz come roaring back.",stopsmoking
"Hello guys. So i have been smoking for 11 years now. Never ever wanted to quit. At the new year, i thought for a moment, i never thought i was going to smoke for 10 years but here i am. I have been struggling to quit since end of the August. It's really hard but i will never give up.

I started to smoke 2 packs a day, sometimes more. I'm at that point that it's never enough. I can't eat because i can't taste any food. I just force myself to eat. I can't sleep. I can't wake up. I don't have any energy.Really, im just 25 years old. It's not normal to feel like this. Gym started to become a lot harder. When i'm with my friends, all i think is my next smoke. I am anxious all the time. Im self conscious of my teeth and my smell. It just sucks. Not a one good think there is about smoking but your addiction really tricks and it's a challenge.

I didn't smoke for 10 days 2 weeks ago and i was a lot better and thats why i know all these are caused by death sticks. Now, i can't stand the fact i'm a smoker. Today is the day i try again. And i know i'm done. I choose life. Fck addiction.",stopsmoking

I managed to quit the year I was 30 with Chantix. I was so short tempered, had vivid dreams, and so much weight gain, but I did it. Stupid me I thought I could ""just have one"" a year later.

I have two young kids. 

I have yellow fingers, I have flehm I cough up regularly throughout the day. My throat has been sore, with sore glands for at least a month now. I had a friend tell me they always remember me having a cough. I've known them for 11-12 years now.

I smoke between 20-25 cigarettes a day.

I made the decision to taper down to 15/day for 1-2 weeks. I managed to smoke only 14 yesterday. It was tough. I felt short tempered, I felt anxious. 

If I can keep this up after 2 weeks I will go down to 10. You get the idea until I get to 0.

"Just wanted to share my experience with other redditors as it may be helpful.

Ideally I would have liked to put this post in the ADHD subreddit, but quite likely it will get removed there as there is a policy against suggesting alternative treatments. 
Also, I remember reading somewhere that there is a strong correlation with people who have ADHD and picking up smoking.

Some info about myself
I'm in my early 30s
I was diagnosed with ADHD early this year

While I have struggled with ADHD throughout my life, I did not have a proper diagnosis and could not receive a proper treatment.

Before the diagnosis - I would use alcohol everyday to shut off my brain immediately after work. I would also occasionally smoke cigarettes as they help me relax and focus. I intentionally avoided depending on cigarettes for the fear of getting addicted.


I was prescribed adderall, and initially I took it for 2 weeks. It helped a lot with focus and concentration, but I felt it blunted my emotions, and affected my sleep.

I thought at this point that perhaps I should just use tobacco since cigarette were so much more effective for me. 

However, genetic research I found that there are alternative ways to get tobacco that are not nearly as addictive.

That's how I came across the nicotine patch. After experimenting with the dose a bit, I settled on using a quarter of the 14 mg patch every day. I would put it on the first thing in the morning and take it off before going to bed.

I found myself much more comfortable with the nicotine patch than I did with adderall or without any medications. I also do not have any urge to smoke cigarette or drink alcohol to shut down my brain in the evenings.

That is a clear improvement in my impulsivity and my mind is much more relaxed and focused.

The only downside I have seen is that I feel so relaxed and comfortable that I don't have much of a motivation or ambition. I'm not sure but this could just be my mind experiencing calmness for the first time - rather than a lack of ambition. Comparing to my mind in non-medicated ADHD state, back then I always wanted to do 100 things at the same time. Not having the same constant urge to do everything that catches my fancy, it may be 'ambition' lost for the better.

I have been using the nicotine patch for 2 months now, and don't see myself going back. I've also tried experimenting not using the patch after every few days - and I can immediately see my mind if much less focused and impulsive when that happens.",stopsmoking
"Even as a young child I was in a smoke filled house and had lived and breathed second hand smoke until I started smoking myself. My first puff was when I was five but I didn't start smoking full time until I was in my teens.  I'd never been smoke free in any way until I quit in January 2018 and I did it cold turkey with no support network of any kind and I was around smokers, and it was the easiest attempt I'd ever made.  


Now I'm that annoying person who says *If I can do it, anyone can.*  


If you've tried quitting you probably already know a lot of these thing but they don't click or you don't care. We know it's bad. It can kill us (don't care). It's a drain on finances (so what). Here's one you already know but don't fully appreciate the extent of it yet.

You stink. I mean you really F'n stink. That ashtray you have outside that you wash very rarely. That's is how you smell to others all the time. Even now I occasionally get a slight whiff coming from my carpets despite never having smoked inside and having deep cleaned them repeatedly. I feel physically sick when I do. Brushing your teeth constantly and spraying perfume and deodorant work no more than they do in a toilet. Now you just smell stupid. Once you are smoke free, you will immediately think back to all those non-smoker friends/family/partners/exes and wonder how they tolerated it. You stink so much more than you realise.   


&amp;#x200B;

You'll watch Youtube videos and read posts like these in forums and get that spurt of motivation which then dwindles.  You want to quit but it seems too hard or you really can't be bothered. If you're like I was, you're probably smoking as you read this.  When I say put it out, ditch your smokes and become a non smoker right now, you might want to but probably won't but it's really as simple as that.  You're a non smoker until you smoke again. There's no such thing as ""quitting"" or  ""cutting down"".  
You have everything you need to quit right now. There is no easier time or date or setting. Stopping right now is the biggest advantage you can give yourself as it is about doing new things and breaking your old habits. Quitting later is your old habit and this is the first thing you need to change. Stop deluding yourself and clinging onto things you think will make it easier as they only make it harder.

Don't set a time to start quitting, don't cut down, don't try weaning yourself off with gum and patches. It's the slow bandaid but it does work for some, however, a little statistic based on *my* own experience and people *I* personally know is that 100% of those people who relapsed after quitting were on gum/patches/nic vape and 100% of those who have successfully quit never touched them and also changed their surroundings to help break their habits. 

Quitting isn't about stopping an addiction, it's mostly about breaking a habit which has slowly changed you without you realising it.  You need to reclaim and retrain your brain. Nicotine is completely out your system in around five days or so and no matter what you think your body is telling you, you no longer have a physical addiction. You don't *need* it, you just think you do. The more you feel like you want to smoke and the stronger the urge, the closer you actually are of being completely free of it. It's the nictone death thrall. When you're getting closer to being free of it, it's the nicotine itself **not** the lack of nicotine that makes you feel crap without it in order for it to survive in your body. Once you understand this, it's easy to push through the urges as it's a sign that you are succeeding not a sign that you're dependant on it.  

You probably already know this too. Maybe you have quit and are a few days or weeks in, so here is something else I've said before to people -  changing the things you see every day help just as much, sometimes more, as changing what you do every day.  It's not just about taking a new route to work, or trying a different supermarket or taking up new habits like exercise or drinking water.   


Something as simple as changing your phone wallpaper is a good start. Don't go back to one you liked before, get something new, something different. Perhaps try something you don't particularly like as you need to get yourself out of your old mould. 

Rearrange your furniture! Change your curtains! Use a new dining set, rearrange the pictures you may have on display around the home, reverse your bedroom layout and change your quilt covers. Rearrange or replace your fridge magnets, listen to music you would never listen to, buy a brand of food you usually don't buy, stop at that shop you pass by every day, buy a new mop, switch which drawer your clothes are in or better yet, do a big cleanout... No matter how small it is, no matter how trivial even if it's something you don't realise you notice, somewhere deep down in the recesses of your mind, you have noticed it and this little change goes towards rewiring your mind.   


Look at how much it costs you to smoke per week, then look at something that costs the same. If you were thinking of taking up a new hobby, now is the time to start as you can afford it. Put your money towards your new passion.   Just like your stench, you probably don't realise how much money you are burning. When I quit, for the first few weeks/months I would use my ""smoking money"" to reward myself with something new each week. Sometimes saving up a few weeks and getting something big. I would start buying new things to slowly replace what I already had so I was seeing new things every day which changed my mentality and attitude. Got a new kettle, okay, I'll try a new brand of coffee, new coffee? Okay, new mug. One little thing opens up the path for another little thing. It snowballs. 

One day I was driving to the local shop for full cream milk for one of the seven coffees a day I was making with my new kettle, the next thing I was walking there and buying light milk purely because it has a different label to the one I was used to seeing (these little things really do help) to make one of the two coffees a day I now drank. I went from two teaspoons of sugar to half a teaspoon and I wasn't even trying to cut down or be healthy as it just happened once I started to change little things I saw every day around my home. It *all* snowballs.

However, there's also the health thing we all know about. I knew but I didn't care.  I developed lung problems six months after I quit. Who knows, I might yet develop cancer down the track but at least I don't have these problems while still trying to quit while burning money. It was actually the money that drove me to quit and it was having new things and fresh scenery that kept me off it. I only really struggled the first five days but it was nothing like it had been the 3464315 attempts beforehand. This time it was different as I just stopped and saw nicotine as the little bastard it is. I also hated being a slave to my smoking schedule and also the stigma of having society now ranking me below junkies as they are ""victims"" and smokers are apparently just ""selfish c\*nts"".  It's not true and I still empathise with smokers, but I was no longer going to give my money to tobacco companies and even more to the government so I could stand in an alleyway on my smoke break while paedos, rapists and non-smokers looked down on me for hiding myself away and minding my own business.

I had intended to cut down and set a start time. 31st jan 2018, but on the 27th as I was halfway through the cigarette I would have before brushing my teeth before bed and something in my head said  ""stop clinging to shit you think makes it easier as shortcuts now are long paths later"". 

Wanting to sleep but having to smoke first for what reason? Brushing my teeth many times a day because of smokes. Spraying deodorant to ""hide"" the unhideable. Having to go outside in the cold to smoke.  Automatically deducting smoke money from my paycheck before food and bills. Why was everything to my smoking schedule? Why did every single photo of myself have me with a cigarette? I put it out and as disgusting as it sounds, I actually still have that half bitch wrapped up. I immediately threw all my smokes out and in the following days I gave all my lighters and ashtrays away.

That next morning I craved a smoke. I pulled out the wrapped half smoke and took a whiff and felt sick. Then I pulled out all the crap from my cupboards and drawers and decided to just do what I had always put off. Out with the old.  I changed my ringtone. I changed my desktop wallpaper. I thew out all the old crap in the freezer, I rearranged furniture. All the things I mentioned and it was this stuff that made it easier. Seeing different things every day whilst still in my familiar environment was the kick I needed.  I would donate things I still used and needed in order to force myself to have to get new ones or at least replace them with different ones. I'd deliberately put myself in situations where I would have to walk or take the stairs instead of drive and take lifts and I started drinking water despite NEVER drinking water. Really, before my only intake was through coffee.  


Changing your environment and the little things you see, do and use every day is what will break your habit which is what quitting is all about. It's all mental after the first week. Ditch your smokes right now. If you already have, go make a huge mess in your bedroom forcing you to do a deep clean. If it's clean, then go attack that junk drawer or shed. Anything no matter how small. Rearrange things in your home, move your lamps around, put your spoons where your forks are and your forks where your knives are. Rearrange any artwork or posters or even replace them and rearrange what's on your shelves, change the radio station in your car, eat somwhere different for lunch, go online and look for a penpal or message a complete stranger, grab a random book you know nothing about and start reading even if you don't read. You can do the same things but do them differently, you can live the same life but in a fresh environment.

 Just imagine you are in a web and you need to move as randomly as possible to get out of it. It doesn't need to be all at once, but you need to change more than just stopping your smoking as in hindsight you will see how much your smoking has changed your life and habits bit by bit without you realising it so you need to do more than just stopping smoking and trying to tackle the sum of those changes in one go. Start reversing that and get off of cigarettes schedule and create your own. 

Obviously exercise is one thing that comes up and I know it's not an option for everyone, so just walk. No excuse unless you're in a wheelchair in which case, just roll. Already jog or roll? Reverse your run path. 

You'll make things much easier for yourself in the long run by making them harder in the beginning but don't forget to reward yourself (just don't do it with food, especially sugar as it goes hand in hand with nicotine.)  You'll soon forget you are trying to quit as you will be adjusting to these new habits and changes while the other little things like the new morning alarm ringtone and that horrible incense you started using even though you hate incense start going to work on you without you realising it.

Changing things about yourself also changes how other people are towards you or what you talk about which in turn changes how you are. Try new shampoo. Get a new keyring. Go to the pet store and buy the ugliest goldifish they have that nobody else will want and give it a home. Change change change and new habits.

I started keeping the bottle caps from bottles of water for some unkown reason. next thing I knew I had hundreds of them. Ended up giving them to kindergartens for arts and crafts and still do it. Feel free to develop temporary quirks or lean into existing ones.

One last thing. I used to think I smoked more when stressed and it helped to relieve it and that seems to be the general consensus among smokers. However, I've found it to be the opposite and I now see that studies have found the exact same thing. Smoking does not reduce stress in the way we think it does. Taking that break you take to have the smoke and breathing along with the temporary dopamine hit does, but that's part of why we smoked in the first place. It's all mind games but it's not until you are free of it all that you can see to what extent it all controls you. I think back to chainsmoking when stressed and only ever feeling better temporarily which is a big difference from now as now I stress like normal people but am free to actually tackle issues and not smell while doing it.

  
I know it's a long rant and I've probably repeated a lot as i just started typing without looking back, but I'll leave it as is. I only hope that even just one person will flick that switch in their head and realise that you really do have everything you need to quit right this very minute. So stop with the excuses and stop waiting for the ""right time"" as that is all your enslaved mind talking. I was the same and as I said, I am now that annoying person who says *If I can do it, anyone can* and that really is an understatement. I was such a smoke addict that there are still friends and family who don't truly believe I've quit like it's some ongoing prank. Ditch the bitches and go out and buy yourself the ugliest toothbrush you can find. It's something you see every day and will have a greater impact than buying one you like.   


Good luck, unless you are still putting it off in which case, stop undermining yourself. You probably don't like it when other people mistreat you or make you do things you don't want to do, yet here you are doing it to yourself. You probably know that too and don't care in which case just remember that you really REALLY f'n stink and your deodorant cover-up just makes you smell stupid.",stopsmoking

"Hi all, 

I used to smoke consistently for about 13-14 years. The past 2 years were probably the worst I was moving from a pack a day towards a pack and a few in the past year. A long depression created a downwards smoking spiral 6 years ago, where I was having sleepless nights and I would grab my headphones and smoke 5-10 cigs in a sitting outside until I was tired enough to go to bed, and with lockdowns and wfh for a year and a half now it only got worse.

The past months I finally had enough, I was feeling it was  bad for me, every morning I knew I couldn't continue like it. I gave my cats food, grab a drink and straight back out to smoke a cigarette, sometimes I made it 3-4 hours but Everytime I caved. This week I faced I couldn't do it cold turkey, I needed help. So I bought 2 weeks worth of patches and some nrt mints for sudden cravings. I felt shame I had to admit I couldn't do it without. My mom used to smoke, she used the patches and I had the occasional streak of not smoking and she said something along the terms of you better not need patches to quit, you are 25... It haunted me for years I could do it myself how could I be so addicted, and each time I failed within a few days the past months even hours. 

But right now marks end of day 2 without touching a cigarette, it feels great. It hasn't been without challenge but I truly feel I don't need them anymore. I put the first one on and it took 5 hours for me to walk to my balcony as an involuntary movement to smoke when I realized, I don't really want one, its just a habit. The first day I made it through with one additional mint in the evening when the craving for worse I felt the craving, used the mint and it went away. Now day 2 and I made it through without a mint, not because i set myself up to not use them, just the craving wasn't there. I have had the occasional craving, at traditional smoking moments for me, before I start making dinner, after I finished dinner, when I stretch my legs after sitting down for an hour, but all in all they are slowly getting less noticeable through the day. The patches have a 10 week plan, 6 weeks 21mg patches, 2 weeks 14mg and 2 weeks 7mg. I feel I could go faster but I am not going to, I have tempted faith enough, and I am not tempting it again to save a few ¬£'s. If this helps me quit it forever I'll happily pay for 10weeks worth of patches 90¬£ for 10 weeks, thats about 1 week of my old smoking habit, it's worth it, I am worth it!

Caffeine doesnt help as much. Does anyone have other ideas? like sweets or tea. I jus feel so exhausted every single day and idk how to feel awake anymore. I used to sip on a 5 hr energy during work last time but those are actually too intense to take on a daily basis and im scared they actually cause some health issues.

"I'm 32 now and began smoking at 14 (to look cool and get all the chicks, as one does). 

I got up to about a pack a day at my peak but mostly hung around consistent homeostasis of 10-13 cigs a day. When I turned 24, it began to feel extremely gross so I gave up regular chronic smoking and switched to having the occasional one while out drinking, yadda yadda. 

During the pandemic when all bars in my city were closed, I began drinking more at home out of boredom and smoking (in my living room and blowing the smoke out the window - gross as shit I know). I decided I was going to give up even occasional smoking for the highest quality of life possible, better lung power for the gym, no more stinking clothes or furniture, not spending $10 fucking dollars for smoking 3 cigs out of the pack and angrily throwing the entire pack away the next morning, etc etc. 

Anyway... feelin' damn good for the most part. Extremely cranky at certain points and accidentally snapped on a friend over text the other day and apologized. But other than that, I'm giving myself slack to give in to cravings for sweets, coffee, sleeping in, being distracted, etc. I have a great therapist I see weekly. Welbutrin and Adderall both decrease my cravings for tobacco pretty significantly.

"This would be a long text. 
I, M 24, starting smoking at age 18. I didn't know until then there exist different brands or type of ciggarettes. 
First ciggarette was smoked with a friend after school when going to home. It was unpleasant and I didn't feel good tbh but after one day or two then I again smoked not because I liked it but kinda looking cool. Then again now without a day break. Initially thought this isn't addiction  just to show off but it goes on. Started smoking 2-3 cigarettes for a day till 1year . Then started  smoking (approx)10 ciggarettes a day for the next 1 year. 
Later next year I joined college and I was feeling great because now I can smoke in my room as I moved to my hostel far from my home. 
Started smoking weed in 1st year of college initially joint or roll but this started getting real and ciggarettes go to around 20 maybe a day. First two year of college went smooth as nothing is hitting hard in studies and kinda get   average grades. I was good in athletics until high school but started smoking my breathes keeps getting shorter and in college I tried to fit in schedule I left every sport because of smoking ( breathing issues) 
I started feeling slow and heavy because a bit worry and ciggarette. 
3rd year I finally trying not to smoke or if I do only 1-2 max but failed nearly everyday for six month. Nothing worked a bit. Used videos on YouTube and read blogs but practically I break every vow made to myself. Every week I said this will be last and 3rd day I smoke. 
Then comes my final year in college it was a disaster as company(firms) start recruiting from my college then I face backlash at every point starting from not good academics, no extracurricular, body posture not great and stamina. Every time I feel a bit less,  ciggarette was there to provide support (I feel at that time). 
So my last semester, I started having pain in my heart but  ignored ( should never do ever). Then feel if I don't quit this time then it would be lethal and tried again but again failed for 2-3 times. It was March last year then lockdown I came home but with hope that I never smoke again and damn it was somehow worked this time. For straight 2 months strict lockdown no shops open though I have tried to get ciggarette but thankfully failed every time for two months. After that I am at home working online (got job in a online interview ) and no ciggarettes till now. 

Things that may have worked for me but could help you - 

1. Mindset : You have to say that I can and you will. In my case I failed many times but finally done it. Do tell youself every time you smoke that this is not good ( I know it is hard) 

2. Avoid triggers : find which triggers you and remove that part with something else. Eg. Mine was when I was exhaust doing something with mind ... For this I break the concentration for sometime drink water and then back and other trigger when I saw smoking or near smoke. 

3. Friends and emotional support: very important but not worked well for me. My friends helped but they aren't quitting and majority of time I failed because of my friends because when I see them I get trigger. I have sacrificed but it pays back now. My friends tried to morally support me but no help there. I made distance a bit to my friends ( this was painful) but we are good. 

4. Exercise and food : They are useful but mind don't want that. I made excuse to me it is ok ( I am young I didn't need and....). They will work only if you by slowly day by day.  Starting slowly but consistent. Remember this has practically worked for me and not from some article. Each day is important . Each day. 

5. Stretching: I separate it from exercise because you don't need go for explicitly streteching. You can do it anywhere. Neck stretching is games changer. When feel to smoke stretch 

5. Alcohol and weed increases amount of ciggarettes

These are main factors but small bits also helped as this post is pretty lengthy now itself so if you want ask anything feel free. 

I know there are smokers for about lifetime and don't have any major problem but remember everyone is different and their genetics. 
Smoking help you think is my most apologetic excuse to smoke again but in long run it will not help I assure ( as much I have experienced)

"I've been smoking cigarettes for six years. Like most, I tried to quit smoking, but it didn't help me. In fact, out of the six years that I smoke, I've been trying to quit for two. 

My problem is that if I don't smoke for a long time, I start eating everything. I'm sure that I'm not the only one with such a problem.

 Recently, my friend gave me a good idea- to buy a Juul. My friend has been smoking Juul for quite a long time, and every time I forget my cigarettes (and this happens quite often), I take the device and make a couple of puffs. By the way, ironically, I gave him a Juul to stop smoking cigarettes. So, it happened that now he belongs to a group of people who like to smoke delicious liquid and exhale pleasantly smelling smoke. 

I think smoking Juul is much more convenient than cigarettes since I can take a liquid containing Cannabis or other delicious additives. I read that the liquids for vape/Juul have cannabidiol, and cannabidiol is a drug contained in plants from the genus of hemp. It increases the heart rate, excites the body, and relaxes the nervous system. It's precisely the effect I want to experience after smoking. 

I'm interested in people's opinions about smoking Juul and vaping in general and would really appreciate tips on how I can get vaping products with Cannabis to chill and relax. Thank again for taking your time to read and for any advice you could offer.",stopsmoking

"I accidentally stumbled on this subreddit and it gave me the urge to share my story. I don't know if this could help people in your journey but I hope it does give a bit of encouragement.

During the last 2 years of college was a different time for me. Had good and bad friends, experienced one of the most memorable times and worst times of my life. Got the habit of drinking and of course smoking. I struggled to fix myself right after that but I did.

Vaping actually help me with it. I went from 2 packs a day to getting the highest nic juice and started going down from there. There came a point where it didn't gave me dopamine any longer or to be more exact, it became tedious cleaning my vape, buying that once tasty vape juice till I got the vaper's tongue and seeing my hard earned money going out in a puff of ""water vapor"".

However, I realized one thing after that. I never experience relapse. Somehow vaping ease it out for me like how you would slowly quit smoking from 1 pack to a few sticks a day.

I still get that urge now and then to smoke of course. On the first year of quitting, seeing people smoke made me go a bit crazy but I held on. Now, I'm happy to say that I'm free of it. It's like I was back to those days when I was young when I see people smoking and hate the damn odor and stay the hell away from it while wondering why do people smoke.

I persevered on my own and made the decision to quit myself. No one pushed me, my family never new I smoke until I told them a month after I stopped.

I just wanted to back to the days that I am the one in control of myself and not anything and anyone else. Now it's been 3 years but I'll stop counting. Forget it about it all and not say ""I stopped smoking"" to ""I don't smoke""

Hello there kind buddies, 

After smoking a pack daily since 2012, one wonders what your body can do when you quit smoking. I quit about 3 weeks ago and have never ever felt so good. Although I have some mountaineering experience and I run a mile or two every few days, I never could push myself to anywhere near the level of my fellow hikers or athletes. 

But today, am elated to mention that I competed this workout in about 2 hours or so. My LADY friend , who always use to beat me in all sports , today got to see my fitness abloom. Honestly she have had making fun of me for time immemorial. But I guess not anymore ü§º

It is just remarkable what your body can do when you quit smoking in just 3 weeks. Apple Watch Health data indicates 5 to 10 % improvements in VO 2 , SpO 2 and so on. 


For those of you still struggling , also consider how much YOUR health shall be beefed up. 

‚ÄúProbably , you will never ever go back to smoking when you have observed how much your athletic abilities have increased. ‚Äú 

You all made this possible, thank you so much.

"Hey everyone.  As the post title says, I have been smoke free for 6-weeks.  Up until the end of July I was smoking heavily before starting my quit with the level 2 patch.  I did sneak one cigarette after a week, so I reset my quit date, but have not smoked since then.  Once I ran out of the patches, I switched to the 4mg mini lozenge, which I preferred, since it allowed me to experience the withdrawals and satisfy some of the ritualistic parts of smoking.  I only used about 4-6 lozenges per day as opposed to smoking an entire pack.

I allowed myself to run out of all nicotine products a little over 3 weeks ago and have been nicotine free since then.  Those final 72 hours were not that bad.  Some anxiety and restlessness, but I was in a situation that allowed me to literally avoid people the entire time, so my external triggers were very limited.  While I did have a little too much time to overthink, there was no way for me to obtain any cigarettes or nicotine products, so I had to just deal with it.

Now I do have access to smoking, but also a solid support network and commitment to staying smoke and nicotine free.  I have been able to drink alcohol and be around other smokers without relapsing.  I have had cravings, and will continue to for a time, but I feel confident in my ability to stay smoke free.

I have been reading Alan Carr‚Äôs book, though surprisingly I haven‚Äôt finished it yet.  I plan to, but haven‚Äôt needed to lean on it as much as I expected.  I‚Äôm just happy to be this far along.  It is possible, even if you relapsed after many years, like I did.

Do smokers find it disrespectful when their SOs ask them to stop smoking? I'm just afraid he'd want to break up with me cause I haven't said anything about it for 2 years and suddenly I'm bringing it up??

"Hope ya'll are having a great Tuesday morning!  So I quit smoking July 14th of 2020.  But about 2 months later, dealt with something that shook me and resulted in me smoking about a half pack in two hours or so.  I realized I made a big mistake and threw the rest out.  That was the last time I smoked which was about a year ago (don't remember exact date).  I've quit several times in the past (2ish months max) where a fuck-up would almost guarantee me becoming a smoker again.

It was extremely important that I did not psychologically ""start over"" or ""start from scratch"" because of the relapse because:

1. It's inaccurate.  I had been quit for two months and was used to being a non-smoker.  If I started smoking again, I would be starting over as a smoker.  Staying quit would be me continuing being a non smoker.  Additionally, I hadn't built up the physical addiction, nor patters of a smoker even if I smoked a half pack.  I did not re-pavlov-dog myself.
2. If my attitude had been that I had ""thrown it all away"", I would be more down in the dumps, and more likely to say ""might has well have another since I'm starting over anyway"".  The important thing is you don't have another, and not undo all your work you've done by becoming a smoker again.

While I think it's important you don't allow yourself to smoke, it's also important to be easy and on yourself and realistic about the situation if you do.",stopsmoking
"Hi all,

I (23M) have once again decided to break these shackles of addiction. I first started smoking when I was 18 and have been smoking close to 2 packs a day for the past years. I have been trying to quit for around 6 months now, failing everyday.  My longest quit lasted 3 days. After close to 50 failed attempts I decided to give myself a 2 week smoking pass and then put out my final one 40 minutes ago. 

I want to quit because I spend way too much time on smoking (close to 4 days a month according to my app). This affects my ability to work, even when I am working and not smoking all I can think about is my next smoke. I tend to take a break every 30-45 minutes for a smoke, so as you can imagine I can barely get anything done. As the frequency of my smoking increased I started feeling very tired, came down from working out 4-5 days a week to probably 1-2 times a month. 

All these constant failures in quitting smoking have taken a huge toll at my self esteem. From being a very confident guy I have now become someone who's scared of taking up even the simplest of challenges. I have decided I can't live like this. This needs to change, my life needs to change. I want to focused, confident and fit again. That's why I am giving myself one more chance and I hope this is the last attempt of my life.",stopsmoking

If you doubt any of the above, I would be happy to try and change your mind.

"I (42f) am taking another attempt to quit smoking. I have the problem that I am also smoking in my apartment. Remaining concentrated during home office is one big difficulty that I need to overcome. Additionally I want to finish writing my phd thesis. Some might argue that it is not the best time to quit, however, I don't enjoy smoking at all anymore. I feel with every cigarette that I am just doing this because of the craving.

I can go for hours without cig if I do something physically somewhat active. However in front of the monitor and the meetings I have the urge to smoke basically almost all the time. 

Additionally I developed unhealthy eating habits in the last year because I often smoke instead of eat and probably also subconsciously use the cigs for blood sugar control and my cigarettes have increased from ~15 up to sometimes ~23 in the last months. 

Moreover I have thyroid issues and the recovery of the thyroid function in the first three months is at least at parts responsible for what we experience as withdrawal. Cigs interfere with thyroid function in many different ways.

I also get blisters on the lips, brain fog, heavy PMS, very emotionally unstable, panic attacks, when quitting for some weeks

All this makes it a bit difficult for me to quit, while I still need to perform well enough every day. 

I tackled a lot of my health issues with supplements and diet, and I would like to go the next step to break free from this addiction. I really do not want to continue smoking because in the long run the negative effects definitely outweigh the shortterm avoidance of a difficult withdrawal and I can't stand the smell of the smoke everywhere anymore. It is disgusting. 

I came across this talk by Dr. Andrew Pipe
https://youtu.be/8nUDS9g46Uc

and he explains very well how NRT need to be individually adjusted on order to be beneficial for individual people, by first dosing high enough and then second decrease the dose in little steps. So I will give this a try. I will not quit immediately, but use the NRT to first reduce the amount of cigarettes daily, once I have found a more or less stable dose with the patches, I will replace single cigarettes with gum, whenever possible. 

I had some old patches still at home, way over their shelf life, but I thought worst case they are inefficient and I tried them since they weekend. Since they are 5mg only I observed when I would return to the frequency of approximately one every 50 minutes and noted that this is the case after approximately 4-5 hours, then I use a new 5 mg patch.

Let's say that until now I can say that the urges have drastically decreased and I feel a kind of peace and inner relaxation that I did not have for a very long time.

I am writing this OP as kind of a documentation of my own path for all of those that are interested in the approach and are in a similar difficult situation.

I am nit going to argue the quit once and for all approach. I tried for years, had weeks without cigarettes and it always affected my daily performance in a way that was actually intolerable.

Maybe I am too weak or the complexity of the other issues makes it too difficult for me. The once and for all approach did not work for me and this is exactly the argument Piper makes in his talk. If something didn't work several times, then maybe it is times to try something different.

Best wishes to all of you. I hope I will be successfull and I hope that this will help others as well.",stopsmoking

"Hello all you wonderful quitters! 

I‚Äôve been having a few symptoms of quitting smoking - needing to clear throat, croaky voice, coughing by up phlegm (although nowhere near as much as at the start).

I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I checked my smoke free app this morning and to my amazement I‚Äôve been smoke free for the best part of a year and a half! I couldn‚Äôt quite believe how long it‚Äôs been and I don‚Äôt even miss the little bastards one bit! 

It feels like when I first quit and my lungs were clearing out just not as bad, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to start again this long after quitting. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I am going to have a chat with my GP just to put my mind at rest but just wondered if anyone else had any similar experiences? Is there anything that you did that helped?

Thank you! 

Also, it‚Äôs worth mentioning, it‚Äôs been happening for 4-6 weeks on and off and I‚Äôve had a few COVID-19 tests in that time and I‚Äôm all clear!",stopsmoking

Besides that, I am a healthy and fit guy, and it slowly came to my realization that I really need to quit.

"I'm sick of being a smoker, I want to get rid of this habit that lives in my head all the time and makes me feel like a slave. I'm 27 years old and have smoked since I was 15, on average a pack of cigarettes a day, I've tried to quit several times in recent years, the last time I managed to stay for fifteen days, I was feeling very good, my energy for physical activities improved a lot, my nights sleep despite waking up all night and having nightmares, the next morning I felt so good, like I had more oxygen in my body and my heart was doing the right job. 

It's not easy, in my family many people have died from cancer and there are still many people who still smoke, it seems that the plug doesn't fall on my conscience and makes me have a willpower to overcome this addiction. Every time I try to stop I come back because I have problems with alcohol too, I'm an alcoholic, I'm drinking on average three times a week, usually until I lose consciousness.

This has affected my life in many ways, I am single, without friends, without purpose in life. Just waking up, working, exercising and doing it all on autopilot . I know I need to change and act soon, because the disease of alcoholism is going to get worse. But every week my brain tortures me saying it's okay if I go out and have a few beers, I know I'll never drink small amounts, the word moderation doesn't exist in my vocabulary.

Do I need to wait for the worst to happen and hit rock bottom? I do not think so! My decision comes from now, and I would like to follow it through the next few months and see how my life will change. It's a lonely process and since I don't have friends anymore, I'll have to trust myself, have the necessary willpower and do what needs to be done to keep a sober life, this is my wish.

"I (17F) stated vaping after someone close to me gave me one about 6 months ago. I‚Äôve been buying ever since, and all while telling myself I‚Äôm not addicted. I seriously lied to myself.

Not only that, but I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt eat when I‚Äôm stressed anymore (think I may have some kind of eating disorder). It makes me feel better about myself even though I know vaping might have more serious consequences. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been working on, but I think Ive only replaced one problem/addiction with a worse one. 

I‚Äôve tried to quit vaping twice to no avail, and I unintentionally go to vape after so many hours without.

I don‚Äôt know how to be more conscious of that in-between moment. If I don‚Äôt vape I get mood swings and nausea. If I do I only get a headache, but feel better mentally (obviously, that‚Äôs what an addiction *is*).

Essentially, I‚Äôm asking for advice. How do I quit by myself or get help outside of parents/guardians? I have big plans for myself, and nic addiction is the last thing I need holding me back. I would never forgive myself.

"Hello Team r/stopsmoking and welcome to my TedTalk.

This is a little vent from which I need reassurance, tough love and common sense. Perhaps at the end some concrete tips. First though, the part you skip if you're a fan of tl;dr:


I stopped smoking on the 12 of April 2021. It was a fantastic choice. I didn't want to be a 25-year-old smoker and to an extent, I have been successful.


For nearly five months I just didn't smoke. The first 3 or 4 weeks were a bit of a ball-ache, but I could push through. I had reduced my daily smoking heavily in the build-up and was averaging 2-3 cigarettes daily before the quit; as a result the withdrawal symptoms were (I imagine) quite mild. I ate a bit more, gained some weight and then carried on.


Imagine the pride I felt! 8 years of smoking cigarettes and not wanting to and finally I had fingers firmly hooked into my bootstraps, pulling me to where I wanted to be. It was good and I had stopped thinking about it, apart from brief cravings of a few seconds. These served more as a reminder that I used to smoke than a reason to begin again.


So imagine my dismay today, realising that I am back on track to making one of the most stupid decisions of my lifetime -- AGAIN!


I MEAN WHAT SORT OF FUCKING IMBECILE MANAGES TO KICK THESE BASTARDING DEATH STICKS AND-


But anger towards myself won't help much, I believe. I am a flawed human and flawed humans don't respond well to emotional criticism.


I was with a girl. I like this girl. This girl smoked.
This girl introduced me to friends of hers. They smoked. We sat outside in the grass at a music festival. They smoked. We wore black. We appreciated how good we have it, by lamenting how bad others did. We drank alcohol.


At some stage in the night, this girl lit a cigarette and a thousand details came together in my mind.
She looked sexy, it smelled good, we were giving the world a middle finger, because we weren't allowed to care about something as trivial as our bodies, when there was so much else happening.


I'll stop now, because I am aware that I am to an extent romanticising a nicotine high and addiction.
This is why I took the cigarette, though. I took two more that night.


I was aware that I did not want to smoke and I was aware that I had no physical urge to do so. I very simply just felt like it, hence my description above.


Last Wednesday and Thursday I smoked 4 more cigarettes, I think. I was at a training course for work and we drank in the evenings. 


I've seen too many of my friends in recent years go from people who only smoked at parties and bummed fags to regular smokers. None of them wanted to. They all thought they had it under control. For many it was a long, slow descent into dependency. I reckon my history with tobacco would arrange a speedier recession into addiction.


Here I am then, back with you beautiful people. Fuck this for a lark. It's not worth the pretty girls and collective nihilism. It's definitely not worth the yellow teeth and smelly clothes, standing in the cold with a blocked nose.


I cannot yet reset my quit date. I remain proud of the 12th of April. That was the day I began having more days without cigarettes in my life than with. But I crave accountability, too.


Does anyone have an all suggestion for me in which I can work in a relapse, take the relapse seriously, but not reset all the progress I made.


I have not damaged my lungs to the same extent I did over 8 years of smoking with these 7 cigarettes and I would like a smoking app or tool that reflects that.

"I'm quitting today for the last time. 

I realized that a lot of US culture just likes to make things sound hard and turn them into some kind of heroic quest. But a lot of stuff just isn't that hard or heroic, it's only slightly uncomfortable. The tobacco industry also has a strong interest in telling you nicotine is super addictive and impossible to quit. I think it's just not true.. 

All I have to do is occupy myself for 10 minutes or 3 bad days or whatever at worst. After 3 days the nicotine is long gone, and the nicotine addiction is barely an itch, it's not some crazy monster like meth.

"This quit attempt has been different. I've been listening to Alan Carr's *Easy Way to Stop Smoking*, finished it and threw my pack and lighters away. I didn't do it because that's what's expected or asked, but because I knew at that point, **after almost 20 years of smoking**, I was no longer a smoker. 

I set my no smoke app timer, which for me doesn't so much represent how much time my willpower has held out as much as it represents how long I've been a non-smoker from that point on -- to commemoratethe transition. That was 11 hours ago. 

I of course still feel cravings (same strength as the ones that didn't wake me up from my 8 hours of ugly-sleep every night), I still feel light withdraws, and my subconscious still sends weak-sauce suggestions, but I don't have that brainwashed dialog wreckin' my day. I'm not feeling anxious or deprived.  I'm genuinely happy, I feel good and I have no desire to smoke ever again. 

So this afternoon, I got what I would have considered the **BIG** test during my previous quits: I went shopping and my car fob slid out my shorts' pocket and under the seat. I bent over and saw one camel blue short next to a green mini-bic lighter. The occasion only missed the slight scent of sulfur and a low demonic cackle to turn it into a cliche movie temptation. 

My first thought was -- damn, I'm really **not** a smoker anymore. I don't know how many of you have had the degrading experience of tearing aparr your car during a quit or just a day when you were gonna be out of smokes for awhile, hoping to find a pack with one cig left or a half-smoked cigarette in the ashtray, but I've had that humiliating experience. Many times. When I saw that camel blue and lighter, I realized I hadn't combed through my car this time. Hadn't even considered it. I then threw the cig and flick away without a problem. It wasn't even a temptation.

I have to emphasize: this has never been my experience before and I've tried to quit a *brazillion times*. I also want to recognize the percentage of smokes who read the book and don't find it easy the first time (keep up the tries, I believe in you). I also want to say, I know I'm just one cigarette away from falling back into the trap, being a smoker again and needing to stop.  Again. Relapse is the norm and should be a part of rehabilitation. 

But right now, I feel... like celebrating! I'm really happy! 

I'm wishing everyone who is stopping, myself included, this happiness from now on! I'm rooting for ya'll!",stopsmoking
"I went over 500 days without smoking and started smoking socially again whilst on holiday with a group of smokers.

Resetting my smoke free days on the app will be absolutely demoralising, but I have no one to blame other than myself. The motto ‚Äúnot another puff, no matter what‚Äù is SO true.

But before long you‚Äôll start rationalising smoking to yourself again, and because it‚Äôs been so long since you last smoked, you‚Äôll have forgotten most of the negatives of it. 

Starting from now I will be quitting again. I‚Äôm hoping this time around it will not be as difficult, especially as most of the negative habits haven‚Äôt formed yet. But man does it feel shit to be back on day zero again.",stopsmoking

That shit HURTS I cannot believe that I was able to smoke that strength of nicotine when I used to smoke. It wasn‚Äôt even enjoyable at all. Just horrible pain in my throat as I was trying not to die from smoke inhalation. Thank god I am not a smoker anymore,stopsmoking
now it's about making sure i continue to keep myself accountable and keep my eye on the prize. wish me luck !!,stopsmoking

"So 6 months back I stopped smoking. I had quit and started smoking again in past. since over a year I was trying to smoke. one day I just said F it, whatever cravings I get bring it on. I don't want to screw up my health anymore. 

so from March 1st week I stopped smoking, I would usually spend around 250 to 300 CAD per month. smoking a 25 sticks pack in 2 days. and 1 pack costs 15$ for pall mall blue.

to motivate myself I purchased a glass jar, I would put 100$ in it per week as a symbol of how much I didn't spend on smoking. 

the first week was the most difficult. I didn't get so much of physical cravings like stomach pain or headache. my symptoms were more like restlessness, couldn't sleep, uneasiness, I would get angry quite easily. but that was only for 1 week. and I was smoking for around 7 to 8 years. 

after the 1st week, things started to get good. my brain fog started to clear up. I never knew I had such a thing. I felt lightheaded, I could think clearly without getting angry. I just felt a big weight has been lifted away from me. so I started taking evening walks. before I never felt like walking or going out since my work is from home now. 

and from that initial 1 week of torture, after that everything is good. at times I would crave it while I'm watching movie and I see someone smoke, or while I was stressed. but I did not give up.

I was more curious to see how my body / mind felt when I'm off nicotine. because since 20 years old I am smoking everyday for 8 years now. cigarette had become such an everyday thing that I couldn't imagine life outside of it.

now 6 months later, I see the glass jar in front of me in which I used to put my cigarette money when I didn't smoke. now it has totalled to around 1500$! I could not imagine I was spending so much on nicotine. now I am planning to buy myself a gaming pc this Christmas.

if you're a person who's struggling with quitting smoking. imagine if you could buy a gaming pc or any other thing for free! just by saving your smoke money!",stopsmoking
"Been smoking 2 packs a day for about 15 years now. Need to quit though for money ($10.44x2 a day) and obviously health reasons. 

Ive tried like a million times to quit and always fail because of how withdrawals make me feel. I started vaping 2 years ago (still do currently) and I think its made my addiction even worse. If im not smoking a cigarette I have this deucheflute in my mouth. 

Any tips or suggestions? Gum, patch, lozenges (lozenges seems like best nrt to me)?

Appreciate it!!",stopsmoking
"I am 2 days cigarette free. I actually quit cold turkey. I have noticed that my cravings and high, at night I feel like I have tightness in my chest but overall I‚Äôm just plain TIRED. like no matter how much sleep I get I‚Äôm still tired üôÑ",stopsmoking
"Just wanted to share that today im officially two weeks nicotine free after 8 years. 

Last night i was out drinking and ofcause i got urges to bum again, but although the people i was with had the puck (i mostly used snus) right on the table and were smoking themselves (they didnt know i just recently quit), even in a very drunken state i managed to resist and even decline when offered some. 

Ive quit for a few months before, but got back in it this exact way.
Im very proud that even in that drunken state i declined, i think its a sign that even my ""subconcious"" has willed itself away from nicotine. Heres hoping that im rigt. I dont want to touch nicotine ever again. Useless waste of health and money just to feel normal.",stopsmoking

"So I haven't formally quit yet, but I've been on patches for about 2 weeks now. It has reduced my smoking from 7-10 a day to 1-3. My body is happy. 

Today I ran out of smokes and I haven't bothered going to the shop to replace them. I'm making the decision to not and stick with the patches only for the foreseeable future, with the goal of getting rid of the patches eventually. 

It's a good decision but also extremely challenging because I'm applying for work and going to interviews atm which is very stressful.

My motivation is that I have an idea of a future I want to build for myself and I don't want that overshadowed by mortality dread. It's a powerful enough motivation that I'm making the decision to quit before it's too late.

Shit is hard though, bros.",stopsmoking
"Hello everyone,  


This is my three week update.  Here are my [introductory](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/), [one week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdwrih/one_week_update/), and [two week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pif0tx/two_week_update/) posts if you are interested in my journey, if not, this post should serve well as a stand-alone too. 

Unlike last week, I had zero things that could remotely resemble cravings. I'm free, it's over. For those of you thinking about quitting, or early on in, I think it needs to be emphasized how excellent it is to not be a smoker. I speak with a lot of people and share various experiences about a lot of topics, so although I haven't personally experienced every one of these things, I feel confident with the ones I have and the way the others have been described to me to say that all of these are in the ballpark of what it is like to be done with cigarettes. If you have done any of these things, feel free to add.  


Getting glasses, or even getting lasik. Either way, you can literally see the world in a way you never have before. No more being a slave to bad eyesight or pair of glasses/contacts. Every aspect of your daily life is instantly improved by the eye-sight you should have always had. Imagine living your life thinking your vision was fine only to discover that it is so much better. You'd be ecstatic.

Building an emergency fund. Or becoming debt free. Personally, I have never found an unexpected problem that $8000-$10000 doesn't fix. Of course, I don't have a family so my number could probably be lower than that, but I like the security. Point being, this is another thing that completely changes your life for the better. Car breaks? Unexpected bill? Covid Layoff, etc. It's amazing what this one feels like. There's no more money stress. I got this one out of the way early, but there was a time in my college days where I was so stressed about money than I would literally have dreams at night about still not having $2 to buy a coffee. Once I decided enough was enough, and put everything into saving cash for these problems, the problems stopped happening. 

Getting fit. Even just mildly. This is a good one too. I've never been fat personally, but I have been so out of shape that it was almost as bad. Getting off the couch, getting out of bed, just anything that involved any sort of voluntary movement seemed like such an inconvenience. After just a few sessions at the gym, and it doesn't matter what kind of workout you do, as long as it's *something* it will work*.* You'll get your life back and instead of making a face expressing that you want the asker to ensure that it is something important when asking you to get off your ass to do something simple, you'll leap at it because not only is it easy, but it is also fun to help someone. They wouldn't ask if they didn't need your help.

Getting out of jail (like I said, I talk to a lot of people with very unique experiences). Or escaping Poland in the Soviet ages. 

All of these things result in the same feeling, the freedom. The getting your life back. The Air smells good, the lighting is more vibrant, you want to jump for joy and you actually can! You're not trapped, and you realize that you never had to be. I'm sure there are countless others, and it's probably easier to just ask what the best moment or lifestyle adjustment you've ever made was, and tell you that smoking can't be topped, only matched. It's wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only been three weeks since I've had a smoke, or any form of nicotine, but it actually feels like a distant memory now. Not that I was a smoker, but the act of lighting one up and inhaling the smoke. Right now, that act seems so out of the question that it's hard to imagine actually doing. I guess that that is to be expected when I have not smoked the 509(!!!) cigarettes that I would have smoked over that amount of time. And yes, that is truly insane. 509 smokes. Never again.

One thing that I think Allen Carr understated, although still emphasized in his book was the relation to will power. He pointed out that it takes willpower to start smoking in the first place, and it was very easy to nod along to that. Not a single aspect of smoking is actually enjoyable until you're addicted to the nicotine, and yet we worked hard to get to that point. Why? I'm not sure, but anecdotally, I thought about every smoker I knew... It was just most of them, it was ALL of them who could be accurately described as *strong-willed* I can only speak for myself there, but I have a hunch that most people would draw a similar conclusion when thinking of the smokers they know. Maybe there's one or two out there somewhere who aren't headstrong, maybe.  


My Ferrari fund is now at over $330 after the three weeks. Mathematically, there's still no reason I won't be able to buy a supercar at some point in my life with this fund built with money saved from smoking. I'm going to love this, but already I find it hard to imagine that I will enjoy it more than being free from smoking. 

It's also amazing how little I go into gas stations. I think I may have actually been inside one once since my last smoke. Usually just pay at the pump, don't deal with those damn lottery ticket people, lines, etc. The smoke free app doesn't calculate the time saved from that into their models, but calling that 5-10 minutes per day doesn't seem unreasonable.  


Finally, today is the start of football. This is going to be interesting because NFL games have LOTS of time for smoking. I used to constantly smoke while watching football. Especially up here in Canada. See, we get Canadian commercials, and they're repetitive and terrible. We're get the good doctor, a virgin moblie, expedia, a truck commercial, and an NFL shop one during every single commercial break. Quite often, these commercials will play more that once in each break. The jingles in your head are so irritating after an hour that you have to mute the TV. This is also why I don't miss watching anything on The Paramount Network where their ads are all just clips of their own shows. Sometimes even while you're watching that exact show. 

That was an interesting post for my three week update, I came in without having a lot to say and rambled, hopefully it was at least entertaining. The truth is, it's hard to keep writing specifically about not smoking as it's become such a non-issue after three weeks. Once you kill your addiction (I called mine ""The Dirty Bastard"") by starving it to death via not letting it have what it wants, there isn't anything that would make you want to be a smoker. There just isn't. I'll never be a smoker again, and nothing about that seems uncomfortable... or even anything short of the best feeling there is. 

Thanks again for sticking along for the journey. If you have anything to add, please do so. I'll keep these posts up if I can, but some will turn into rambles like this. Any time I spend rambling is still better than any time spent smoking.",stopsmoking
"Hey yall, so I've smoked for 15 years. A bit over half a pack a day right now. I want to quit. I've tried alot of things to do that but I just start again. I'm in recovery and not drinking plus not smoking is really hard for me. I have the patches but I just tend to put them on then eventually go back to smoking. I did cold turkey once for a couple weeks, I've tried tapering down. I don't know what should I do? Any advice would be good. I've been on and off sober for a year (ultimately trying to be completely sober which I am right now). Anyone else in recovery with ideas would be great. I do really want to quit.",stopsmoking
"I have to do a cotinine test (nicotine test) multiple times for surgery. First time I passed (quit cold turkey for 30+ days) but I ended up buying a pack due to a close friend passing. Anyway, will I clear the test if I need to take it again in 3 weeks? I was sorta pushing it last time (my lvls were 60 ng/ml) which showed I was around secondhand smoke (nothing i can do about that). It needs to be under 100 ng/ml. I‚Äôm done smoking again so need to know what my chances are. Yes, I‚Äôll still be exposed to secondhand smoke.",stopsmoking
"Hi All! I've been a smoker for about twenty years. In recent years I would typically smoke 10-15 cigarettes a day. Today I've been smoke-free for five days. I'm using the 14mg nicotine patches which appear to work so well that I hardly notice anything. There was just one occasion yesterday where, after a couple of beers, it was hard to resist the urge to bum a cigarette, but I managed in the end. Other than that I feel like having instantly become a non-smoker without suffering any unpleasant side-effect. Is this normal? I was planning to follow the suggested programme of 4 weeks of 14mg and 4 weeks of 7mg, but I feel like perhaps I can already switch to the 7mg ones much earlier.

"Have done some attempts in the past, with a few months without smoking at maximum.

I feel strong enough to persist. Something has changed.

I had a date set for later (23th Spt.) but i just had to do it now.

"Hi there /stopsmoking community! Endless gratitude for the advice, support, and stories on this journey of self-improvement. This is my personal experience in case it can help someone along the way get through even one craving,  from a 10 year smoker and 5 year vaper

Wanting to Quit:
-felt so shameful/embarrassed about this habit. I was always ended up lying to friends, families, and coworkers to sneak out to get a fix. 
-awful migraines on the daily
-it‚Äôs expensive!! Living in NYC on a modest salary, I cut corners on almost everything but justify spending $20 every two days on nicotine. This is $300 a month. $3600 a year. I would bust my ass off at work for a $3.6k raise
-felt my mood was dependent on a drug

Quitting:
-I have many attempts of quitting smoking before, but don‚Äôt like to see them as ‚Äúfailed‚Äù attempts.That 25 day streak is still 25 days I didn‚Äôt smoke. Progress isn‚Äôt always linear. Some people can quit first time cold turkey and that‚Äôs incredible! But I am not one of those people. I try to look at it as if it‚Äôs a workout. I wouldn‚Äôt expect to get my goal mile time the first try, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I am doomed and should give up. Please keep trying 
-the reason I always end up smoking again is because I can‚Äôt stand being irritable. I‚Äôm trying to identify my triggers and find replacement behaviors. Recognizing my weak moments makes me actively try harder in those times
-I end my quits by taking ‚Äú just one puff‚Äù which ALWAYS leads to the habit again. I either bum off a friend  or tell myself it‚Äôs ok to ‚Äútreat myself‚Äù just this one time. You are lying to yourself. If you never make that micro-decision for one more puff, you won‚Äôt fall back into the trap. 

Resources:
-Allen Carr‚Äôs Easy Way. This is not a magic book I read and immediately found it easy to quit, nor do I use all his techniques, but am at least armed with the knowledge. Just get the book. You can sometimes find it at the library even. It is probably 5 hours of your life that you would‚Äôve been on Reddit anyway. Main takeaway is that nicotine does nothing for you except bring a tiny bit of relief that nicotine caused in the first place (paradoxically the feeling a non-smoker has all the time)
-patches and nicotine lozenges. I‚Äôve done the patch before and didn‚Äôt have intense cravings (and mostly even forgot about smoking after a week or so). This is the first time I‚Äôm doing two types - 14mg patch for a week, now at 7mg, and maybe two 2mg lozenges throughout the day. I haven‚Äôt had any really bad cravings! Even stepping down was fine, I was kind of moody for the day but nothing dramatic. Can update when I am completely free from NRT (sorry Allen Carr).
-workout. Do a YouTube workout, take a run, do some squats. Whatever works for you to exert your body somehow and get that sweet endorphin release
-SmokeFree app. Satisfying timers to keep track of your quit time, little daily missions, and things to scroll through while you have a craving helps a ton!
-journal. Write down your reasons, struggles, and benefits. This is really cathartic for me. 

All these things ($15 book, $50 NRT, $1/week SmokeFree app STILL cheaper than smoking)

I believe in you:
-don‚Äôt give up!
-you will be so proud of yourself!
-I am proud of you!
-si se puede!",stopsmoking
"I was bored. I wanted to entertain myself. I live in quite small town and there are not so much options to entertain yourself. I figured out there is something like speaking club for those who want to learn english in some government library. I wasn't really interested in learning english I just wanted to get some interaction with human beings. So I went there.   
I came too early and I was seating alone in a big room. There were tons of very old dusty magazines on shelves. People were coming but somehow they all seemed kind of ugly to me. Everything seemed ugly. I wanted to smoke so much, just one puff. I understood that I can't stand being in this room with those people anymore. I got out.   
On a way home I wanted to smoke so much, but I was repeating to myself something like: it's easy to start smoking and it will be not easy to quit again.

"Older dude checking in. I started smoking when I was about 16 because I thought it was cool. Fast forward 30+ years and I have smoked well over 100,000 cigarettes. Well, that was stupid.

I successfully quit once when I had my first kid, I started again when I lost my second. Fast forward a few years and my kid isn't far from leaving home for university, I'm tired, my body aches even though I get lots of exercise, I worry about cardio vascular issues when I wake up with tingling hands, I'm single and smoking hinders my options and I'm not going to lie or try and hide the fact I stink, smoking is expensive and times are tough these days.

I'm getting and feeling old.

But I'm not giving in. I've spent the last few months losing weight, getting stronger, learning about all sorts of new stuff, getting better at my job, becoming more empathic and passionate. Nicotine is my last anchor and has been the majority cause for the remainder of my problems. It's made me sick and has been keeping my sick for decades.

By chance I stumbled upon the quitsure app (no affiliation and it's free) and for the first time I've been able to understand nicotine and be honest with myself about my smoking. Diving into the psychological side of nicotine addiction has made the step of quitting so much simpler. I've tried and failed with NRT, vaping, cold turkey, and reduction, all of which in hindsight seem like silly things to do now that I understand how nicotine works in my body and brain. I am now well equipped to spend the rest of my life as a non-smoker, in fact the though of a smoke disgusts me. I am free.

Here's to a better life for all of us.

**tldr;** understanding nicotine, the way it interacts with our body and brain, and the psychology of addiction has had a huge impact on my perception of smoking and the thought of having a smoke disgusts me.",stopsmoking

"So I stopped smoking for a week. I started feeling my breathing get less forced and my cravings get less frequent. All great. But then I went out for a couple of beer.

And smoked the whole pack in one evening. So here I am, back to square one in just a couple of days. And my throat and tongue feels like shit. 

I've set a new quit date for the 15th. Fingers crossed it will work this time.",stopsmoking
"Hello there. I have been trying to quit smoking for the last 6 months but I relapse at the third day on almost every attempt due to stomach problems as along with extreme physical discomfort.

What side effect I had been going through:

Bloating.
Vomiting.
Extreme stomach pain.
Dizziness.
Heart palpations.

I imagine this is happening because my body has became extremely dependent to nicotine. I don't know what to do.

I don't want to nicotine patches gums or any other physically coping solutions.

I really am reluctant to see a doctor about this. I just feel like I should be able to quit without having this much of a physical side effect apart from having cravings which I can deal with.

I would appreciate some advice from OG ex/non smokers in this subreddit.

Note: I eat a lot of fiber to regulate my stomach problems but they don't seem to help a lot.

When you are reading here the people that are having a difficult time and the ones that already are like me great amounts of time passe. And you just realize it just does not matter anymore. Nothing triggers you anymore. You no longer see a cigarette and imagine yourself light one. It is just not anymore on you. What I means with this text is people it is rough on beginning but like many that smoke years or decades. If after 1 year and a mindset in the right place is all it takes for you to stay smoke free for life. Then just imagine you have 1 year to finish the course or degree and after that you are free.

"Hi, ive been smoking weed for about 2 year's straight now. I really want to quit, i always find myself saying  that after i run out ill quit, but before i ever run out i find myself ordering a new batch of weed even though i clearly cant afford it.

"Damn smoking leaked back into my life and then I told myself I wasn't mentally ready to quit etc etc.

Anyway I had a bad day a few days ago which has led me to quit alcohol again (hopefully for good this time) and smoking.

I haven't had many cravings tbh, it's not been a battle so far, I left my tobacco at my brothers house too many miles away and I told him to keep it for himself, I'm done with this bullshit.

I'll be back posting again, I like this place it does help.",stopsmoking
"I still have friends that smoke and from time to time, I might get a craving for a split second when I light up. But once those split second cravings, I remind myself that I don't smoke and that the smell is so gross. Nor will it make me feel better. I also quit for a reason. 

Despite that the social aspect might have been what I enjoyed most about when I smoked, by the end of the day, it's an addiction. And you ALWAYS here lifelong smokers talking about how they wish they could quit and tell me congrats or good for you. This might sound a redundant but I've never met someone that still smokes who goes, ""you quit smoking, that's lame"" nor do they interrogate me about why I quit. Addictions of any kind suck and you gotta realize you successfully did something many smokers and addicts failed to do. If I had a dollar for every time my friends said they wanna quit or need to quit, I'd be super rich. And I'm not judging them. That just goes to show how addictive smoking is and how hard it is to break. Going back to that and having ""just one"" would restart the process.",stopsmoking
"2 pack a day smoker, for 2 years, 31M. Before that, didnt smoke much at all. Got addicted quick due to depression. 3 weeks in, each week my lungs improve and breathing is becoming easier, its so great. However,

First, my eyes always feel as if there is pressure on them, and I noticed an increase in floaters. Which sucks. My eyes hurt the start of the second week of quitting smoking cold turkey. Anyone have this and what did you do for it? I'm going to guess its related to my sinuses going nuts.

Second, the nightmares. I have been having nightmares every night. I never used to remember dreams, but each day I wake up with a nightmare and it takes me an hour to feel better because they are so vivid and upsetting. 

3 weeks in and still recovering my body, withdraw and breathing. I had no clue quitting would take such a toll on my body. Thanks for any recommendations.",stopsmoking
"I have been looking for different ways to frame the discomfort I feel while quitting. This discomfort has been called withdraws, but I don't like that because it's focus is on ""not-smoking"" and relief from cigarettes.

Instead, I offer this: When we drink, we can reasonably expect to wake up to a hangover. A hangover isn't withdraws from drinking, rather it's the consequence of drinking. We might even swear off drinking ever again because of the pressure and pounding in our heads, the body aches, etc. While a ""hair of the dog that bit you"" might level you out a little, you know that the only way to avoid hangovers is to not drink again. 

I think the same about discomfort after quitting: this is a cigarette hangover. Every craving between cigarettes is a hangover. A puff might level me out. But the only way to never have this hangover again is to not smoke. 

I hope this might help someone when they're arguing with their own reasoning during a quit",stopsmoking
"The last 2 days I did nothing but try to quit smoking. For years Ive been trying to quit. Everytime I would fail after around 20 minutes. I tried everything.

"Me and my BF have been dating for five years and I‚Äôve always said that smoking cigs was an absolute deal breaker for me. I just hate every aspect of it and I don‚Äôt want my partner smoking. I was very up front to him about my feelings towards it from day one. He always agreed and said he thinks it‚Äôs nasty and I thought we were on the same page. Fast forward a few years and he starts hitting all of our friends vapes. Which I feel like isn‚Äôt as bad as cigs as far as the smell but obviously the addiction is still there and harmful. 

I asked him to quit a bunch of times because I was worried about his health and after like a year and a half he finally quits (I think) Turns out he just switched to cigs. And he was hiding it from me for about a month. I smelled it on him one day and kind of put the pieces together. I confronted him about it and he apologized profusely but at the same time he kind of didn‚Äôt want to stop smoking cigs. 

I was just very hurt that he lied to me and hid this very big thing thing from me as well. We got in a huge argument that lasted hours over the course of a few days and I basically told him for the millionth time that I can‚Äôt date someone who smokes cigs and that it‚Äôs a deal breaker. But for some reason that hurt him because he felt like we were bigger then that being an issue and told me I was only conditionally loving him. 

I don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm in the wrong at all because my position on it has never changed and will never change and Ive always made it SO clear to him . But he feels like I only love him on the condition he doesn‚Äôt smoke and now he feels like the way i view the relationship is different then the way he does. In the end of the argument I basically said that I obviously love him more than I care about the Cigs but I need him to quit and I just couldn‚Äôt stay together if he doesn‚Äôt. 

He told me this was kind of a good thing because he‚Äôs been wanting to quit anyways and this will just push him to.

My bf got these alt cigs with no tobacco just to help with the craving for the act of smoking and I asked him how it‚Äôs going and he just says it‚Äôs shitty and he feels like he wasn‚Äôt ready to quit.

"Hey everyone. I'm at day 5 quitting smoking. I broke the rest of my pack 5 days ago, but then smoked partial cigarettes without the filter and probably had less than 2 full ones for 2 days. Today is the second full day without smoking aside from a bit of a butt I smoked yesterday. 

It's hard. After the 3rd night, because it was so hard, I felt a bit of relief for a moment in the morning, and it was like I remembered that it is possible to feel joy without smoking, but then it went away and its back to being difficult.

With smoking its like you feel as though you can only feel joy from smoking and everything else is better when smoking, but the sobering reality is that everything else is just passing the time and the only feeling of joy is from smoking when addicted. 

I know I have experienced joy in the past without smoking, but when going through cravings its like you forget or just can't even imagine feeling it anymore without. However because of that morning on the third day when gandalf appeared with the sunrise at the east...(jk, nerdy joke), I know I can feel joy without smoking and that the reality is every little thing will start to bring joy, but its still hard to imagine when going through serious cravings.

I guess writing this just helps, because I know even something like smelling fresh air in a forest would be 10000x more enjoyable when not addicted or even something dumb like macaroni on the stove, and other things like sex(even without a partner), which just feels like releasing an urge when addicted to smoking, and playing games and getting a good item which when smoking is just like ""well now I'll reward myself with a cigarette"", because the reality is any sense of joy(arguably a false sense) and reward relies on smoking when addicted.

Anyways, I was writing the post for help at first because I needed help because I lost that 3rd morning feeling and was struggling to imagine joy without smoking, leading me to consider smoking again, but logically I know on some level it will get better and the only thing I can do is keep going with no real concept of when I'll actually feel joy again.

Also coffee is arguably not helpful, its more of a high than a down like smoking and when really high you just want something to bring you down even more, but the habit of drinking it seems to help a bit. I've been trying to have tea more than coffee because just the habit of a hot bitter drink is nice(I feel like without sugar its actually more enjoyable because the sugar just feels like a poor smoking substitute).

Also having essential oils in a diffuser seems to help a bit, along with the smell it also makes the air more humid causing you to sweat out more nicotine. I've also been running every day/other day. I feel like the more I do to get through smoking the harder it is, but I also know its partially because everything I've been doing is making me get rid of the nicotine faster causing stronger cravings.

Now I'm just ranting though. If you're struggling just know you can experience joy without smoking even though its almost impossible to imagine when going through strong cravings. If you've had a brief moment of joy without then just hold on to that feeling. The reality is I haven't truly experienced joy in over 10 years from smoking/drugs and I know it could be years until I really experience it again, but it has to be better than this.

I'm honestly not usually this depressed, which makes you think ""well I laugh and what not when smoking"", but the reality is aside from those brief moments with family/friends, you're not fully experiencing joy because those hours and hours between those moments you could be enjoying yourself rather than passing the time and numbing your body just to feel rewarded from dumb things you do when you can just feel rewarded by the actually thing in itself instead of relying on a cigarette.

"Just curious about people‚Äôs experiences.  What made your quit possible?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/plupob)",stopsmoking
"Some benefits I got after I stopped smoking

* My throat doesn't hurt anymore. One of the best benefits. My throat was always irritated and dry and in pain. I was addicted to cigarettes but my throat was miserable.
* I cough 80-90% less. Didn't cough a lot before, but it's still better.
* Just generally breathe so much better. And the smells become stronger. 
* I am generally out of shape so I do run out of breath easily, but this improved so much after I stopped smoking. Now I feel like I'm actually a little out of breath and not dying. 
* Might be unrelated and TMI but I have better bowel movements.
* Just feel better, not being tied to smoking. I am really happy I quit smoking. 

Tips:

* You need a strong motive and you need discipline. I thought I had a strong motive so I was baffled that I wasn't quitting already. Then kind of had a fit over the fact that I keep smoking and just quit. I was very frustrated that I couldn't quit. It helped.
* You don't have to set a date if it's not your thing. You can if you feel like it helps and I encourage you to, but you can also just say ""fuck it"" at 2 am on a Tuesday and it's going to work. 
* Keep your hands and mouth busy whenever you feel like you want a cigarette. I wouldn't recommend chips or such. Maybe gum or mints or candy that you can suck on. And allow yourself to eat what you want to a certain degree. Remember: it's very hard to diet and quit smoking so most specialists advise against it. You can return to the diet once the cravings stop and smoking is less of a problem. 
* Not gonna lie to you, the first three days are tough. You can't focus, you want to smoke, etc. The good thing is that you are stronger than your desire to smoke. It's one day. You can power through one day. And if you can power through that day, you can power through all the rest of them. 
* Only if you feel prepared: As soon as you're out of the crazy cravings period, you can try to expose yourself to triggers (drink coffee, drink alcohol, hang around with friends who smoke). In this way, over time, they will not present as triggers, or, at least, they won't be such big triggers. It's also fine if you avoid these triggers. Whatever keeps you smoke-free. 
* If you fail, try again. Keep this as a goal. Most ex-smokers failed at least once. Quitting is hard, but it is doable. It doesn't matter if you manage to do it the first time or the seventh time or whatever. As long as you manage to quit, it's worth it. 
* Do not tell people you quit unless you have to. Some people can be assholes when you're trying to quit and the things they say will not always be helpful. You just mind your journey and ignore those who talk big but don't appreciate or respect hard work. 
* If you need professional help, seek it. Smoking is as much of an addiction as any other addiction. It's okay to need help.",stopsmoking

"An unexpected benefit of quitting smoking has been increased energy. Just passed the 3-week mark. Cravings are decreasing.

Sometimes when I smoked, I would feel that with the nicotine ""high"" would also come a sapping or draining of my energy. I was aware of it, but figured that the ""benefit"" I perceived from smoking outweighed that energy drain.

I was wrong. Not only was it a physical energy drain, it was a mental one too. My mind feels faster and I feel more free overall to do what I want because I don't have that nicotine stealing my energy.

I anticipated feeling better, but I wasn't anticipating this much of a difference. It's significant.

Started smoking at 18. I'm 41 now. Active lifestyle‚Äîsurfer for 30 years, rock climbing, spearfishing. Quit smoking because it was holding me back from higher physical performance.

"I'm having a hard first night. 

It's 3:30 a.m., and this rude insane addiction just woke me up, screaming through my dreams into my subconscious, that it *needed* to be attended to. It wouldn't be ignored. The more I tried to suggest it away and go back to sleep, the larger it grew until it was a nightmarishly huge beast: a looming three-headed monster of insistent deep cravings, wide-spread withdraw symptoms and unrelenting mental suggestions. Anxiety gripped my body and took control of my voice,  ""This is terrible! I can't do this!"" I wailed to my partner. 

I don't have much a plan. I have some reasons to quit. I have people in my life who want me to quit. But right now, all of my will to quit is being snuffed out by the betrayer part of my mind, which is well-practiced in compiling with the beast's insidious suggestions, telling me why I could (why I SHOULD) have  just have one more cigarette (it'll take the edge off); buy just one emergency pack of cigarettes to get through the worst of the withdraw; I never really wanted to quit, I just needed to cut back; NoThInG iS wOrKiNg! 

I grabbed a cuttie, some ice water and this phone. I read my reasons to quit, my hourly success goals (despair: not even a full day yet -- how many times have I been here). I read some of you on this sub-reddit. 

I remembered: One cigarette doesn't make this feeling go away. One cigarette, my last cigarette, is the reason I feel this way. This is how it feels to be a smoker between their last puff and the next, and the only way not to feel like this is to not smoke one cigarette more. You can't feel satisfied as a smoker -- you can not crave as a non-smoker.

Withdraw is unpleasant -- I don't want to restart, prolong this

I do not want to be anxious, smelly, unhealthy, unable to take any job I want or go any where I please because I have to consider this beastly addiction first (before myself, my family, our well-being). I *WANT* to quit! 

This is working. Relief comes the longer I don't feed the last cigarette with another cigarette. By just not taking a drag, I'm slaying a dragon.

"So, I started smoking around 4-5 years ago (I am 19, about to turn 20, and I started around 15, yes I started fairly young and I am still young), I became quickly addicted because I have BPD and other mental illnesses so I‚Äôm very prone to becoming addicted to things (Ive had a fair amount of bad coping mechanism, some I‚Äôve been able to quit,others just for a while, others not at all), and my whole family smokes and enabled me since I started, but my friends and gf are very supportive of me quitting, she‚Äôs actually the one who‚Äôs buying the patches for me cus rn I‚Äôm unemployed. I tried to quit a couple of times, the most I managed was a year,after that just a few months, always relapsing,but lately I had been smoking like 5-6 cigs a day, tried to go without it like two days and I had very bad withdrawal and I couldn‚Äôt take it. Borderline is kinda very cyclical, things are kinda bad but ur working on them and trying,then you feel like you‚Äôre doing great and getting better and then everything falls apart again kinda suddenly, in this stage is when I tend to relapse, but then I calm down and I see all the shit I did and I‚Äôm like back to square one. (I have a psychologist and psychiatrist and I‚Äôve made progress but bpd is a pain in the ass to have + I have other issues).

Every smoker knows that at morning urge to smoke is just huge. You can kill for this first morning cig. So my situation sucked by a lot. I was in a panic. I didn't know what to do if I couldn't smoke my morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Only smokers will understand how important it is. Morning cigarette.

I was saved by very old(and also very lame) electric stove. It was looking just like black metal circle. And, lucky for me, this metal circle was heating up. But it was heating up so damn slowly. It took at least fifteen minutes before I could smoke from this stove.

So I quit smoking cigarettes on Sunday August 29th, 2021.  My last cigarette was on Saturday night, the night before.  I went 10 days without a cigarette and then decided to smoke just one cigarette.  The cigarette tasted so nasty and made my throat hurt.  

So I'm now back to no smoking cigarettes again.  I switched to oral smokeless tobacco (dip) and this is what has worked best for ME. 

I also have been using nicotine lozenges from time to time, but they just aren't as satisfying as the dip for ME. 

I am not encouraging anyone to use nicotine in any form, I am simply sharing that switching to using dip works well for me because I have less and less cravings for cigarettes as each day goes by.

In my opinion smokeless tobacco is a safer alternative than cigarettes.  I have read many reliable studies and research to back my opinion up.

Good luck to everyone trying to quit and I hope everyone can find a way that works for them.",stopsmoking
"What the posts says lol. When someone asks if I‚Äôd like a smoke and I say ‚Äúnah I quit‚Äù and they get all excited and start cheering for me or whatever? It makes me viscerally angry and it REALLY makes me want to light up in their face and be like ‚ÄúNEVERMIND‚Äù. 

WHYYYY am I like this!? 

It doesn‚Äôt bother me over text or reading it in this thread. 

But I don‚Äôt even tell people I quit anymore because if they congratulate me I am going to vomit on their shoes.",stopsmoking

"I started smoking in 8th Grade, which was 12 years ago. This is the first time I've quit cold turkey.

I've never been big on posting, but I'm just so proud of myself and wanted to share it with someone :D

Anyway, the first 3 4 days were awful. I just kept chugging water anytime I felt the urge to smoke. It has gotten a little easier since then, but I also haven't been able to sleep for more than 3 4 hours at night. Last night, I got 6 hours of sleep and it felt amazing!

My skin looks better than ever, and I can feel my lungs clearing up. I know I can do this. I don't want to be a smoker anymore. 
Wish me luck ü§û",stopsmoking

I have been clean from alcohol and weed for 18 months and I just picked up the nasty habit of vaping again to cope with the stress of school. I want to get clean and it‚Äôs been weighing on me so I‚Äôm gonna give it my best shot at quitting again. Last time I was forced to quit because I was in an ED residential program but this time I need to do it alone. Any advice is greatly appreciated! Let‚Äôs keep each other motivated.,stopsmoking
"Yesterday was my 1 month mark, I was smoking 2 packs a day and quit cold turkey. The first week was the worst but I wouldn't say I was rude or had a short fuse. I've never had anger issues. The last 2 weeks have been worse and worse however. I'm lashing out easier, getting angry at my wife over nothing. 

Playing video games I'm easily frustrated and want to throw my controller (Ive NEVER been that guy before. Ever.) I can't even play chess. I went off on a guy for beating me on a chess site the other day. What the hell is wrong with me? I feel like an absolute dick and a sore loser.

I was hoping to use games as something to keep my mind off smoking but I feel like it's ruining that aspect of my life. I still miss it, I feel like there's a hole in my life and the time I'm saving by not smoking is spent staring at a wall blankly. I'm just so angry all the time and I'm usually a happy guy. My wife doesn't deserve this. 

On top of this my car fucked up. I was spending $250 a month on cigs so I was going to blow that money as a reward but now it's all gone in the fucking car. Feel like I'm getting nothing for quitting now. Anyone else have this a month in? How did you all make it stop?",stopsmoking

"I recently quit smoking cigarettes. I smoked cigarettes for about 11 or 12 years.  I quit smoking cigarettes by switching to oral smokeless tobacco (dip).  The risks are so much less with smokeless tobacco compared to smoking cigarettes.  

Also I would suggest nicotine polacrilex gum or nicotine polacrilex lozenges.  I like the lozenges better.

I went 10 days without smoking a cigarette and decided to have a cigarette and it tasted horrible. 

Anyways I'm back to no smoking cigarettes, switching to dip made it possible.

I'm a very big believer from reading many reliable studies and research that smokeless tobacco is a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes.",stopsmoking
"After 39 years (I'm 57/male) I have quit. I was a pack a day smoker. The reason was a cancer diagnosis (Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma) and I've had one partial Nephrectomy on one kidney and now in a month I need another one on my other kidney. This is my 8th attempt at quitting and it's a heck of lot easier for some reason but....The help I need is how to handle the nagging little ""itch"" I have in the back of my mind that is like "" I need one...I need one"".

I am using nicotine gum and this makes the itch tolerable but there are times it gets to be too much. I'm  3 weeks out and the itch keeps coming and going. I just some tips or suggestions on how to handle this. I have had multiple opportunities to buy a pack but I have avoided this by watching movies or playing video games but I need help when these are not available. PLUS, I do not want to put on a ton of weight either, which I have put on 5 pounds in the past 3 weeks.

Thank you all in advance.",stopsmoking
" I‚Äôll never go back to smoking. This time, for the first time, I really made the decision to never smoke again.

It started with breathing problems 10 days ago (I‚Äôm 30M). Panic hit me so hard that I‚Äôll remember it for years, and it‚Äôll be a reminder to never smoke again.

Things that I‚Äôve found helpful when the urge gets very bad:

-meditation 
-swimming and more importantly sauna 
-going for a walk 
-eating some fruit
-drinking coffe AND doing something physical right away (coffee and cigarettes used to be my favorites)
-slowly re reading THE BOOK

Things that didn‚Äôt work for me in the past:

- vaping
- eating every time when I get the urge 
- smoking only when drinking 
- smoking 1-3 cigs a week

"I guess this has been asked a thousand times, but any advice?  


I'm having my wisdom teeth out in a month, and naturally they've told me I can't smoke for X amount of time before hand, and Y amount of time afterwards. Obviously, the first thing I did was Google ways to get around this warning, and the likelihood of the smoking having a negative impact on the surgery.

Quite frankly, it's idiotic that my brain is wired that way. What an insane idea.

I've been smoking for about 15 years. I tried to stop one, moving onto a vape for 8 months, then caved at a music festival (circa 2013).

I ENJOY smoking. I enjoy the taste, the smell, the feeling. I don't want to quit, but I want to want to quit - if that makes sense?

Can anyone give me some advice on how to even start to want to quit this. I know about Alan Carr, I read the book years ago.

"I had prepared so much for my quit date this past Sunday that I think I worked myself up to expectations I wasn‚Äôt able to meet. I was an emotional wreck trying to quit that way. 

So I didn‚Äôt quit. I ‚Äúfailed.‚Äù I have cut way back and it‚Äôs always on my mind, but then I had to have emergency dental work done. My dentist and the wrath of googling post surgical complications put the fear of God into me. I slapped on a patch and have managed to survive almost 24 hours. 

I am going to stay the course and see how far I can go. I think that‚Äôs the right mindset for me right now. It‚Äôs an approach much like I take with my drinking - I will not drink with you today. I will not smoke with you today. Then tomorrow I‚Äôll wake up and vow the same thing. I can only worry about today. 

Overall, the amount of cigarettes I‚Äôve smoked since that ‚Äúfailed‚Äù quit date is about a third of what I would have normally smoked. I‚Äôm celebrating this small baby step.

"So I stopped smoking 6 days ago now. My cravings are still pretty high, and I've been feeling kinda anxious, sore chest/tightness, achy etc..

Hoping to vent a bit here and see how other people deal with everyday stress after quitting.

I moved with my partner from the UK to Spain in April, and we moved to a new city last month. It's been ridiculously hot all of August and we both have been unwell with different things, so had a shit month. We haven't had a very good opportunity to get to know our city as it's been too hot to go outside, everyone leaves here in August. So we've both had an underlying level of stress, questioning a lot of things, and not enjoying our time here all that much. Recently I started having heart palpitations, which I attributed to vaping alongside smoking (I know..), but I'm still having palpitations 6 days after stopping.. so I'm assuming by now it's mostly stress/anxiety. I've had my heart checked and it seems ok.

Because of everything going on, my stress levels are very high, I feel very anxious and can't sleep well, and I am considering resuming smoking a small number of cigarettes because I don't know if I can deal with this added layer of stress from the withdrawal right now. It's getting a bit too much for me... At the same time, this is the longest I've gone without smoking in over 10 years, and my first attempt at quitting, so I'm sad to let it go to waste and have to go through the same again.

How can I deal with day to day stresses of life after quitting?

Is there actually such thing as a bad time to stop smoking, because it really feels like it?",stopsmoking

"I'm scared. 
Not just because of the carving, but because of the people around me too. A lot of family, friends and colleagues are smoking. 
I'm scared they will offer me some cigarettes (I don't really think that this will happen). 
I'm scared of the evenings with friends when we go out for some drinks. 
I'm scared of my work when my colleagues ask me if I want to go out with them. 
I'm scared what the people around me will say and what they will think when I tell them I want to quit.
And I'm scared of what they will think of me if I fail.

Especially my mom. 
She's a very heavy smoker. She's been smoking for like 40 years now. 
I remember the time we got our first dog. I was in elemantary school and we both wanted one. My dad said we can get one if she stops smoking. We got the dog and a few weeks later I saw her secretly smoking in the basement. 
I watch her going outside alone to smoke after dinner or something and I don't want that for my life. It kinda hurts seeing this. I asked her more than once if she wants to quit with me together, but I think she will never quit.

I'm 26 years old now and smoked for seven and half years. And I want to quit. 
But I don't know if I'm strong enough at this point, I don't know how to handle with the carvings and I don't know how to deal with the people around me. 

And please don't get me wrong. I'm not scared of panic attaks or something like that. I'm just kinda scared.

"Hello! :)
Due to a very traumatic personal experience I have relapsed and smoked a pack in about a week, coming to a climax when I smoked 5 cigarettes today after being smoke free for 2 months. Enough is enough, my lungs have just made the most horrendous wheeze (I should add that I‚Äôm asthmatic) and my health anxiety is on an all time high, this IS my lesson and my last straw.
I have smoked on and off for about 3-4 years (I‚Äôm 21), with 1 1/2 of them being ‚Äúsober‚Äù (is that even a word that applies to smoking cigarettes?). So I know I can do this, I have done it once. I could use any sort of encouragement and kind words, like I said my health anxiety is crazy high and I‚Äôm basically convinced that I‚Äôll drop dead from lung cancer any second (this is only a slight exaggeration, haha‚Ä¶), so any reassurance is happily welcomed.

That anxiety sucks so much. I would absolutely blame myself if she ever took up the habit.

Another thing I‚Äôve noticed that instead of having more energy, the last few days I‚Äôve been completely exhausted, which is disappearing because I was looking forward to working out but want to listen to my body and not push myself too much because I know I have a lot of healing to do.

"hi guys i'm new to this sub! i'm hoping to get some help through this.

so i started vaping december of 2017 (i was 15) to fit in with my new friend group. they didn't force me in any way, i just really wanted to be accepted by them.

i didn't even like it at first. it made me uncontrollably sweaty and anxious. however, at some point, it escalated to the point where it became an addiction -- and i knew it.

i used juul (of course HAHAH) and these days, it's about 1 pod a day. it's even gotten to the point where if i'm extra stressed, i can go through 2 pods a day.

for reference, 1 pod is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes in the level of nicotine and it takes, on average, 200 puffs to finish a pod.

i want to be healthy. i want my lungs to feel better.

i am lucky enough to be only 19 and not be legally allowed to buy vape stuff, it does help with not buying it when i have a strong urge.

i have gum and it helps so much, but for some reason i get into this cycle of thinking 'i just wanna get withdrawal over with' so i stop chewing the gum and then i get so desperate i start vaping again. it's a vicious cycle.

my dad buys me the vape stuff. horrible, i know, but he has been a food addict for his entire life, and he's almost 50. he can't seem to do it and my mom says that he most likely doesn't think others can get through addiction, since he hasn't been able to.

i know i'm strong enough. i have summoned up so much willpower in many situations in my life so i know i can get through it. i just don't prepare enough.

also, just to be clear, the only person in my life who believes i can do it is my mom. she has been a huge help, but my point of bringing this up is to say that i have no other support for this -- as i said above, my dad is no help and my only friend right now smokes daily. she also doesn't seem to believe i can do it, but she's seen me fail many-a times so it's fair i guess.

i just need help adding more coping mechanisms in my life to help me quit and advice for taking preventative measures for when i do get strong cravings.

"Hey guys! Today is the day I'm gonna give up this nefarious habit. I had already tired to stop in the past, but I wasn't really serious about it. This time is different, for many reasons, I joined a local support group run by NHS professionals and attended their first gathering yesterday. Actually, the reason I'm writing this is because they adviced us to keep a diary and share it with other people who are going through the same. I guess it might be useful to find some support outside the group as well, so here we go.


I started smoking when I was 22, mainly because I was depressed and lonely. But the very real reason, I think, was just to piss off my obnoxious, manipulative father who had always used guilt and shame to control me.
I knew I wasn't acting smart, but somehow I felt like I had and **I wanted** to do it. That first ever pack I bought was like a reminder that nothing but me is in charge of my own actions and can decide how to live my own life.  Yeah, it's pretty dumb but somehow it made sense to me. 

But it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. Except... I really like smoking! I like how it makes me feel, the bitter taste of tobacco and the smell it leaves on my fingers when I smoke. It's just not worth it, I know, but still I'm not really incline to conscious decisions when I want something.

Today I trashed the last pack I had, my lighter and ashtray as well. I don't want to risk to fall again for them just because of my impulsive temper.



What did you do to ease the process and motivate you? I see that many people here use apps to track for how long they didn't smoke but I don't think they'll work for me...

Yes, I know that many smokers associate alcohol with cigarettes. But anyone who has smoked for over ten years associates everything with cigarettes. So I don't see a problem in drinking glass or two.

I want to quit smoking so badly but every time i don't smoke for 3 hours or more i get blistered from negative thoughts and depression it cripples me to a point where i even get suicidal thoughts or not caring about anything at all because i think my life i shit.

"I keep getting up to pace, I don‚Äôt really know what to do with myself. I keep thinking about cigarettes and nicotine gum. I do have things I can do but I keep mindlessly getting out of my desk chair to walk to where we used to keep the nicotine gum :( I‚Äôm so excited the physical withdrawals are gone but it‚Äôs so distracting to try and focus on my work because that‚Äôs when I‚Äôd chew it most. Can‚Äôt chew regular gum because that just makes it worse. So glad none of it is in the house or I‚Äôd be chewing or smoking nicotine without a second thought. I made a post about how hard it was around day 4 and I‚Äôm just so glad I made it here because it‚Äôs more manageable than I could ever imagine and it gets easier everyday!

I even abstained from smoking during a very stressful and depressing event. Which I‚Äôm surprised at myself because normally I use that as an excuse to cave.",stopsmoking
"Just finishing up day two without cigarettes and it's going really well this time as I'm using patches (no cravings yet, just brain constantly ""suggesting"" cigarettes, as they are completely ingrained in my life...)

I have been wondering, as the course of patches is meant to last for 12 weeks, and you're getting a constant stream of nicotine the whole time, what should I be expecting after that point?

It would seem most recommendations are that you get down to the lowest patch, and stick with that for two weeks. What then? Just full on stop? For any of you who have tried NRT, what approach did you take after the X week mark?",stopsmoking
"This is not a strict plan at all. I used to have really bad panick attacks, which withdrawals would trigger, and part of me quitting included getting into a better situation (in my case, housed and weeding out toxic people, working on my boundaries, etc) and learning grounding excersizes, self care, cutting down on caffeine, getting support emotionally from friends and other places, and things to manage my anxiety. I believe the fact that I have a lot of trauma and anxiety is what made my old quit attempts so much harder and I've basically learned that it's really important to be kind to myself.

Before March 2020 I'd attempted to quit many times cold turkey.

In March of 2020, when I became housed, someone I live with has breathing problems, so I took care to walk away from the house to smoke, and I tried vape but it was too complex, and then I found vuse ecigs. That worked and it wasn't super cloudy so it wouldn't bother anyone since I was on the opposite end of the house in a room added on later that didn't have vents leading into the house. 

So March 2020, I quit cigs and switched to vuse ecig pods. It was a pretty easy switch, if I'm being honest, and now cigarettes make me sick. The physical benefits were pretty noticable, my breathing cleared up, my stomach issues cleared up. I liked not having a cigarette smell or having to go out of my way to go outside. I liked being able to puff every few minutes instead of smoke a whole cig every 2 hours. Vaping the ecig in bed is nice.

I have attempted to quit cold turkey several times since then and it doesn't work.

So I have introduced nicorette/nic gum partly because it's possible to get it delivered since it's not marketed as a tobacco/nicotine product but as a quitting aid, although if the kids\~ start abusing it it'll probably be unavailable too. (Please don't, people like me really need this stuff. :c)

Fast forward, I'm now using nic gum every couple months. It's a slower process than it was switching from cigarettes because it's not about someone else's health anymore, it's about my own personal mental health, and it's basically me becoming slowly more calm and steady in my day to day life. I do feel that way more often, but one major thing is now holding me back and that's the fact that I work, a lot, and the type of work I do is mentally exhausting and takes a lot of cognitive energy. 

So now I'm working on finding less taxing work I can do to cover my basic needs, and so far that is starting to work out very slowly. And I'm cycling between pods and gum every couple of months. 

The gums works at keeping the hard withdrawals at bay, but it doesn't help when I really, really need to concentrate hard and softening that edge isn't enough.

I expect to quit completely by next March, but I'm not pressuring myself. I am at a point where I'm just tired of nicotine. I mentally don't want it anymore, just my body does. So I expect when the mental load is off, I'll be fine to move to gum full time, and then eventually cycle between nic gum and regular gum. So far, at this stage, regular gum actually helps a lot with the fidgety, oral urge. It's not near as strong as it used to be.

So, to wrap up. 

March 2020 - traded cigs for vuse alto ecig

April/Mayish 2021 - started using nic gum sometimes 

March 2022 - loose goal for quitting 

Overall, it's been a combination of changing my life, basically doing a lot of self therapy, and paving a path where it's possible for me to quit. 

I think it's interesting that in trying to quit nic I've had to really take all this other stuff into account and that as I work on my life and myself emotionally, I'm also working on quitting long term.

It's also nice to be able to call myself a former smoker and to say that I quit cigarettes, after so many failed attempts.",stopsmoking
"I am on day 9 no nicotine and I‚Äôve been running for about 2.5 months now. 

Started at the bottom earlier this year in late June at the most out of shape I think I‚Äôve ever been. I saw really really slow progress but I knew I had dug myself a deep hole. 

I quit smoking 9 days ago and already the difference in lung power is night and day. 2 weeks ago I ran 3 miles under 30 minutes at 9:59 pace for the first time. Today I ran 4 miles at 9:30 pace and felt like I had more in the tank.

I had 2 cigarettes left yesterday, and after I was done with it, I told myself I'll not buy another pack of cigarettes.  I'm not the type to ask a strangers for a cigarettes so I figured it's the first step to quit smoking. But the craving kicked in couple hours later and I ended up buying flum vape. I know it still contains nicotine.

"This may not be relevant to everyone here but one of the biggest stresses I had when I was a smoker was the pressure to hide it from certain people. Like I'd always smoke around friends, coworkers, etc. But when I was around family members or dates that would find it to be a dealbreaker, I was a ""non-smoker"". 

Any time I was near family, I either waited to smoke and sometimes I would stress about being eager to leave them so I could have a cigarette. Sure I was legally old enough to smoke but my Dad would have threw a giant fit considering my grandma (his mom) and uncle (his brother) both died from lung cancer and emphysema at 55 and 58. My grandma died right in front of him before I was born so I never got to meet her. And my uncle died as my Dad was heading down to visit him. When my uncle died in 2012, I was not a smoker and that should have been my sign to never start again, except I did and smoked for about 7-8 years until I finally quit. 

There were times I'd sneak out to have a cigarette only to get paranoid about smelling like it and being caught when my family was in town. That's the insanity of addiction. There were other times I would go on a date with someone who had in their profile ""non-smoker"", ""no smokers/cigs"", or ""don't go out with me if you smoke cigarettes"". I just wouldn't smoke around them or make sure I didn't smell like cigarettes before the date. That was an added stress in itself. Even times when I'd go to the dentist, the dentist could tell I smoked due to stains on my teeth. So it goes to show that smoking does all sorts of damage than just lungs. 

Anyways, once I quit, it took a huge weight off my shoulders in many different ways, but a big one being that I don't gotta worry about hiding it anymore as I don't do it. I've just come to the conclusion that if you have to hide a habit from someone then it probably isn't good for you.",stopsmoking
"So, I was a fairly heavy smoker for a decade‚Ä¶about a pack and a half at the worst of it. Quit ten years ago and became a really occasional smoker for several years with the help of nicotine gum and later lozenges. About 4 years ago I swore off even an occasional smoke and went full time on the lozenges.

Here I am all this time later still on the lozenges but finally decided to wean myself down and quit. Bought some Altoids which turn out to be a decent placebo. Haven‚Äôt craved nicotine since I bought these. 

There is a chance that I am not actually addicted at all‚Ä¶ except for a psychological craving for the peppermint. Perhaps I haven‚Äôt really been really physically addicted in years.",stopsmoking

"I have shared my story before but here is a short recap for context. I had been smoking since the age of 16, going to smoke 23-25 cigarettes per day. It was part of my identity, or at least that is what I thought and I didn't want to quit strong enough. I was active regardless that, no drugs, frequent exercise and a vegetarian so I felt overall healthy. Except I wasn't.

For a completely different reason (not seemingly lung related) I was advised to have a chest CT and there it was. Emphysema at the age of 29. COPD, the disease I though only 'oLd PeOplE' had. My doctor told me plain and simple 'either you quit now and take care of yourself or you walk around with an o2 tank by the age of 50'.   


I woke up and quit immediately. And now I hate myself less for ruining my body and making unrepairable but I am doing my best and being asymptomatic most frequently. I also hate smokers in public spaces! I used to be them and it's just karma biting me in the ass, sitting and having people smoking in my face! I know I can't complaint, I was them and though I was so cool when I was just making my self weak (and poor!).

It has been a year and all I want to say is thank you to this community for your support. To others who inspired me to just keep going and never look back. I wanted to share this small personal victory here and maybe help one or two people who have doubts or fears.

And to those of you who think you cannot quit, I want to say, you can! You deserve better than what smoking does to you, to your body and your pocket. It is not easy but it can be done, I promise. And though it may feel like shit for some time, it is worth it.

"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm trying to stop smoking and i was thinking that I don‚Äôt know much people who are successful in life AND smoker.

For exemple in my family:

They are both a little bit fat and never exercise

My aunt has a master degree and a job she likes, good situation, living in Paris and visiting many countries during the year.

"I‚Äôm at a little over a year and a half (1 year, 6 months, 11 days) and I feel pretty good about it. The smell of cigarettes makes me kinda sick now and at this point I feel like I could go forever. 

My big struggle is now that I‚Äôve pulled myself from this vice and its influence, I can more easily see what I have allowed myself to do because of it. My partner doesn‚Äôt smoke, but they do vape a very high nicotine content vape fluid at a very rapid rate. Adjusting for the nicotine content, it‚Äôs well over a pack a day if it were cigarettes. I bought them their first pack of actual cigarettes. I was the one who changed their mind from ‚Äúthose are gross‚Äù to ‚ÄúI think I might have one of those as well‚Äù and I did the same to our best friend in high school, a friend who is still very important to me and it hurts to see how heavily that friend chain smokes. She‚Äôs still in her 20s and sounds like Marge Simpson‚Äôs twin sisters. 

I wish that I could help them towards quitting the same way that I helped them towards addiction, but it isn‚Äôt as simple, even when I‚Äôve had my own success quitting to lead by example. I would give anything to have never done that to either of them. Anything at all.

Yesterday was the same, my first full day working (I work from home) as well, and I'm very used to taking cigarette breaks throughout the day, I think that's what I'm struggling with most, not doing that same routine I've don't for years.

"I was 15 years old and I was on a plane with my father. The flight duration was only 3 hours. Very short flight, right? But not for my father who was a heavy smoker. I guess he was feeling really bad without his fix because he went to a toilet and tried to smoke there. Do you think it's okey? Have you ever tried to smoke in plane? My father returned to his seating place accompanied by a steward. He tried to make excuses. He said it was all just a misunderstanding. But of course no one would believe it. Now this whole situation seems funny to me, but I think then I felt ashamed. Pimply teens rarely have overconfidence, you know.  
A year later I became a smoker myself. While I was a student it didn‚Äôt bring me that much inconvenience, but when I started working something changed. At one of the jobs, I had to sit in my place for 6 hours without a single break. It's not very pleasant even for a non-smoker but for a smoker it's just torture. I'm sure you know how bad it feels when you want to smoke desperately but you can't.  Approximately once an hour, you could go to the toilet for 1-2 minutes. Sometimes I was desperate enough to take one or two puffs in that time. Do you think it helped? Yes, but not for long. The funny thing is: I was not the only smoker in this office. Lots of girls and guys suffered as much as I did. What a twisted sick world, hah? Why people so stupid? Why am I so stupid?

Today I vow to completely let go of you. 

When I was stressed, you calmed my emotions ‚Ä¶ so i thought ‚Ä¶ when I was tired, you woke me up ‚Ä¶ so I thought ‚Ä¶ when I was sad, you eased the pain ‚Ä¶ so I thought. 

What you really did was cause emotional and spiritual harm to my life. You distracted my thoughts, my reality, my goals, and my motivation. You took me out of the moment every single time I hit you. You brought disomfort when it was warm outside. You gave me a negative self image due to the thousands of times I‚Äôve told myself, ‚ÄúI need to quit‚Äù. When I was watching a movie, you took me out of the moment, barely allowing me to finish. When I was working, you hurt my ability to be the best of the best. When I wanted to love someone, you drowned my emotions, not allowing me to display my love fully. You hurt me worse than any ex girlfriend ever has. You have distracted me to the point of no return. 

Now, I let go of you, and you are gone like the wind, out of my life. I only held onto you for 3 months, but it was a severely toxic relationship. They say to be aware of your relationships, and nicotine, you are the worst of the worst. You are blocked from my life. You are not allowed to call, text, or ring me anymore. I will not be answering. 

It will take me about 3 days to get over the tiredness without you, just like any other relationship. But after that, I know I will see growth like I have been craving, and like I was before I knew you. You, nicotine, were part of my journey, but now, you no longer serve me.",stopsmoking

"Quick backstory; I started smoking about 5 years ago after I left school and got a job at McDonald's. Basically all of my coworkers smoked and I got offers all the time. I didn't do it until I just thought fuck it, I'll try it once. That was a mistake as I ended up enjoying the headrush and starting bumming off them. Then I bought packs myself and you know the drill.

Earlier this year, I quit after smoking on and off the previous year as the pandemic made me think about my lungs and how it was a waste of money when I was getting my Covid cash from the government. I felt happy and I started feeling way more better after I quit.

A couple days ago, I was offered a cigarette by my friend and I thought I may as well just take one as I haven't been addicted to them in ages. As soon as I felt that puff come in, I felt sick to my stomach. To the point where I felt like I was going to vomit. I gave it back to friend and told him to finish it. 

Looking back at it now, I am happy that I am not addicted anymore and the fact that smoking makes me sick now instead of happy. My question is did this ever happen you?

I‚Äôve gained 10 pounds, weight which I could stand to gain as I was thin before. I‚Äôm an avid walker and I‚Äôm very active. At this point I‚Äôm cool with the weight gain but I am wondering when/if this will level out?

Second question‚Ä¶the grumpiness is real! I am in a 12 step program and have tripled my usual routine because I was surprised by some crazy resentments that popped up after I quit smoking. I know that this is my greatest tool but I was wondering if anyone knows when the bitchiness starts to go away. 

Grateful as heck to be a nonsmoker today even if I can‚Äôt stop eating or bitching! Thanks everyone :)",stopsmoking

"So attempts to go cold Turkey have absolutely failed for me in the past. Couldn't get past a day. The main reason was that after a few hours my brain was practically screaming at me that I would fail and that what was the whole point of quitting anyway.

I'm surrounded by cigarette butts, my room and clothes smell like a pub, my teeth are about 2 shades yellower, on rare occasions I can taste my breath and it makes me gag, my whole family hates it, I hate the taste, I'm developing a smokers cough in my 20's and I can't buy menthols anymore. I hate it yet my brain still loves the death sticks. 

So I've bought nicotine patches. The only time I've had moderate success with quitting was when I used nicotine gum over lockdown. It was hell but I got to 4 months and relapsed almost immediately when public spaces were open again. So nicotine patches. I did it then and I can do it now. 

My triggers are coffee, my bedroom, my phone, my computer, social interaction, stress and boredom (so not many üôÑ). The plan is, stay out of the bedroom. Lock all apps except ones I need for work and study. I'll give myself one hour with everything unlocked which I'm going to devote to sobbing to strangers online. I bought a fresh pack of chamomile and I'm going to make chamomile ice tea to sip throughout the day. I'm peeling a few nectarines so I can have something to chew when I get cravings (the segments not the peel). I've got a few deep breathing exercises for when I feel like I'm going to stab someone. 

Hopefully it works. Wish me luck.",stopsmoking

"When I was younger I used to play some RPGs like Neverwinter Nights, Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines, Dragon Age, etc. In such games, the physical and intellectual abilities of the characters are expressed in numerical parameters(strength, agility, wisdom, etc). So, has your strength increased since you quit smoking? Has your agility grown?  
I think a lot of people are afraid of quiting because they think that they will change for the worse. That as persons they will be only pathetic shadows of their former selfs. What do you think? Is it true or not?   
Maybe the most significant change for me is that I became more spontaneous. It became easier for me to go to new places. When I was a smoker I used to think all the time about when I can smoke the next cigarette. Now I can enjoy things that surround me. Take a closer look at them. Etc.

"Hey guys, I'm a 31 year old male, starting smoking at 29 due to depression after I got nerve damage. It felt like the only thing that would keep me calm was smoking. I smoked 1 pack a day, and then covid hit  for 2 years smoked 2 packs a day, as I worked from home and was an idiot. I was noticing the last 6 months a slight dry cough form, and I it was getting harder to breath. Thus, My body was telling me, it's time to stop this crap.

I quit cold turkey 2.5 weeks ago, and right away, I was able to breath better, and was not coughing up a single flem ball, I felt like a new man. Then, the 2ed week, I feel out of breath, and i'm coughing more, without visible flem, but I can taste it sometimes. Also, my throat now hurts when I swallow, I got more eye floaters,, my sinuses are going nuts, as well as my anxiety. I can't tell if I feel out of breath due to anxiety or if i'm really out of breath and just forgot how to breath since I smoked so much (chained smoked a lot). I would not lie to say I'm scared of copd, which I just learned of (everyone talks about cancer, but not many warnings on this fellow). When I go on walks, I don't run out of breath, I can run up stairs just fine, everything a normal person can do, and feel fine, but when i'm sitting still or doing things with low activity I feel out of breath... Which is opposite of what i'm reading. (i've legit been noticing every breath for days now)

Anyway, my wife thinks i'm going nuts due to the anxiety quitting as caused me, and says to wait a year (I smoked and my lungs need to do all they can to clean up) and increase my activity and i'll be just fine. However, the thoughts of copd and it becoming harder to breathe after I quit have me shaking every night. I don't even want tested at the moment, because I was a smoker just 2.5 weeks ago, filled with flem, and know that my lungs are repairing, so if I wait I'd score better...

I'm proud I quit, but not Im just riddled with health anxiety, having a hard time working, can't focus, and just so screwed up.  I thought id quit, and id feel better, but I feel 10 times worse and my mind is making me think I have copd, which I know is not an instant death sentence when treated correctly at my age, though scary.

I do not get why that is such a scoffed at method of quitting.  Not all methods work for everyone, but it might work for someone, and writting that option off for everyone is never a good thing, imo. Because for some, it might be the perfect solution, and they might not be able to suceed otherwise. I do not get why so many science/drug journalists do it.

"Last week I bought a pack of cigarettes after not smoking for 4 years. I thought I was done with them for good. Every once in a blue moon the idea of one would pop up but it was never strong enough to make me buy any. 

Last week my girlfriend had a conversation and it seems she is questioning the relationship. Romantic rejection is my Achilles heal and the only thing I could think of to numb the emotional pain was a cigarette. 

I‚Äôm probably up to 8-10 a day. I keep thinking I‚Äôm done then I crave another. I‚Äôm an avid cyclist, something I really got into after I quit the last time. I can average 19-20 miles an hour and it makes me feel great. Today I went for a ride for the first time this week and rode hard but it was much more of a struggle to keep my normal pace. 

I don‚Äôt want to fall back into this again. The comfort that comes from smoking seems to be the only thing that keeps the emotional pain bearable. I had thoughts of running my car off the road after our conversation, and I figure smoking is way better than that, but I feel like it‚Äôs a slow form of self harm. 

The relationship is not over, things may be okay, but the stress is killing me. If my girlfriend finds out I started smoking that could very likely end it. 

On the other hand, if the relationship ends,I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to just stop caring and am going to turn into a heavy smoker just to get by. 

No one knows I‚Äôve started, and I want to stop before anyone finds outs 

If things end, I have no desire to date again for a while. I feel like this will be the only thing to distract me. 

Looking for words of encouragement. 

TL;DR relationship worries have caused me to start smoking again",stopsmoking

I need my brain and this is why I smoke. I have this book that I wanted to right...for a long time. I think it's pretty good. I have it in my head. 

My body seems to react pretty well to not smoking...it heals itself. I was coughing all day...I think this is good, gets the bad stuff out.

"Just wanted to share what worked for me. I used Allen Carr, but went about it a different way. 

I had previously read Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking, and while the logic made sense to me, I found that I would quickly be back smoking again in situations where I still felt that romantic connection to cigarettes (with certain friends, after work, having some beers), which would then quickly lead me back to smoking all the time. Then i tried something else....

I started Vaping, obviously thinking that it is the lesser of two evils. However, as many would know I found vaping actually increased my nicotine intake due to the ease of which you can do it at work, inside etc etc. After vaping for several months flat out, I was starting to get mouth ulcers and not feel great generally. I realised something needed to change... So I again turned to Allen Carr. However, this time I got the audiobook of Allen Carrs easy way to quit Vaping.

Since starting vaping, I had broken the social addiction to smoking, for example at bars, with friends, on lunch breaks at work, I would vape instead of smoke, and, without realising it had been several weeks since my last cigarette. This was important as it allowed me to see my addiction for what it was, a pure nicotine addiction. Previous attempts to quit, I had convinced myself that it wasn't smoking I was addicted too, it was the social aspect of ""goin' out for a dart"" where your troubles would melt away and the conversation would get more deep and enlightening. However without even realising it I had been easily able to break this habit by simply using a different form of nicotine, which quickly broke that illusion for me.

This little change made the Allen Carr method work perfectly, because it was suddenly so clear to me that it was actually just nicotine i was addicted too (which has no real physical withdrawal symptoms after a few days) rather than smoking cigarettes. 

Combined with the fact that I believe vaping to be incredibly lame (and if you're a grown adult who thinks the rest of the adults watching you do it don't think you look like a try-hard teenager you are very mistaken).

It made the concept of quitting actually exciting, because that ""theres's nothing you're giving up"" line finally made sense. 

Anyway I am now 45ish days completely nicotine free, have had more energy, saved so much money, regained the circulation in my hands and feet and generally have so much more self esteem.

It may be counter productive to say start another type of nicotine to quit smoking, but if you are like me and its the social aspect holding you back, it may work for you!",stopsmoking
"I was going strong for 2 weeks kicking my 10 a day habit using my vape to taper off nicotine. I hit the 9mg mark and felt a bit angry for 2 days but that was it. But after those 2 weeks I smoked again, 1 on Tuesday, 3 on Friday and 1 tonight. My mental health is in the shitter. I got gastritis 3 months ago and since then have been agoraphobic and I missed out on the time of my life, I was meant to spend the summer on my friend‚Äôs yacht in Mykonos. Now I don‚Äôt even get invited to my friends‚Äô get togethers anymore, they‚Äôre like ‚Äòwell hes been sick so long we just don‚Äôt bother.‚Äô NO ONE GIVES A FUCK. I was so nauseated at 1 point I couldn‚Äôt stand for more than 1 minute. I couldn‚Äôt sit in a chair. That time has thankfully passed but the nature of gastritis is such that if I enjoy it it‚Äôs an irritant (I should be on bland foods only and water, I‚Äôm close but I still dare to put cheese on my bread). I was suicidal to the point of going to buy razor blades, but I called a helpline first. Since getting slightly better I‚Äôm less suicidal but I can‚Äôt stand how weak and anxious I am. I have nicotine patches but I‚Äôm too scared to try them because I don‚Äôt want any more nausea, even though they‚Äôre ok for use for gastritis. I‚Äôm looking to get lexapro and klonopin for my anxiety but I lament the fact this happened in the first place. I‚Äôm still so young and only drank and smoked for 2 and a half years. To get this shit so young is incredibly unfortunate. I don‚Äôt wanna be suffering anymore, I just want to be that guy who has a few drinks and enjoys the party. Not the guy who cycles through 10 pills to fucking feel functional. It‚Äôs just such a long journey ahead and I can‚Äôt even focus because I‚Äôll go on a walk and then that voice will be like ‚Äòyou pussy you can‚Äôt even go 500m from your house‚Äô ughhhhhh I‚Äôm so frustrated.

"Good morning all,   


I am now two weeks into my life as a non-smoker, and it's fantastic. I made my introductory post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/) and my [one week update here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdwrih/one_week_update/).  


Last Sunday when I wrote my one week update, the week had flown by and been extremely easy. I was stoked at how well I'd quit smoking and didn't have a worry in the world that I'd ever go back. This week was slightly different.   


Certainly it is still true that I won't be smoking again, but this week there were a few times in the evening where it just seemed like it was something I was supposed to be doing. I went and sat outside in my chair out of habit. I was aware that I wouldn't be smoking but I am still not used to the idea that I don't have to stand up out of my chair every 45-60 minutes. There was one instance where I was contemplating getting my car keys and driving to the gas station, but I reminded myself that I didn't want to be a smoker again, and within two minutes, that settled. No big deal, but I showed signs of a crack there.  


On Friday, I went to a buddy's place for a bbq and a lot of beer. He was smoking constantly as he does, and me? Well, not only did I not have a cigarette, ask for one, or ask for a drag, I didn't even want one. It was completely out of the question! I was not only capable of sitting there drinking without having one, but I now know that I can be in its presence and not be shaken. It was wonderful. I can completely trust myself to never smoke again it seems.   


The worst was when my buddy forgot to get more smokes when he got the steaks. He had to go make a separate trip for more smokes after getting the food. It reminded my of that feeling -- that panic about not having enough. I didn't envy that in the slightest. I am so glad to be done that. And I still have no doubts that my last cigarette ever was 2 weeks ago at 9pm.  


As mentioned in my update, I have saved my smoking money and put it into an index fund. I am now actively calling that my Ferrari fund. It's at just over $220 now (in two weeks), and should be enough to get me a Ferrari in 10-15 years (It might be a used one, or I'll wait longer). That's gonna be a cool present to myself for quitting.   


Looking at the smoke free app, all the health improvements are listed, and noticeable. My teeth are whiter, breathing has improved a lot, and energy is way up. In last week's post, I mentioned that my energy was through the roof to the point that I had to add runs and walks to my general workouts. That is still true, but either I'm more used to it, or it's stabilized -- there's no way to be sure of which, but I'm happy with it. It's a huge life improvement.   


The most shocking number on that app to me isn't my 3 days of life regained just by not smoking for 14 days. Nor is it that I'd have smoked 333 cigarettes in that amount of time, it's the *time spent not smoking* number. **How the hell would I have spent 28 hours smoking?!** The calculation makes sense at five minutes per smoke, but holy smokes is that a waste of time/life. Over an entire day out of my two weeks was used on smoking. And that isn't adjusted for sleeping time or anything, that's just 28 hours gone. So in the *life regained* section, it really should include that. Smoking isn't life, it's an annoying curse that subtly takes over every aspect of your day. And takes full days from you very quickly.  


So all this being said, I am two weeks smoke free and I am yet to find a single downside. Cigarettes do nothing but kill. I went from smoking 25-30 per day to zero with ease and I really hope more and more people make this decision. I want everyone to experience life as a non-smoker. If I can do it, even for two weeks, so can you.

But my boyfried caught a cold and couldn't smoke for a few days and then took this as a good opportunity to quit again. I really didn't want to and we even fought about me not seeing the point of even trying anymore. In the end I agreed to it and now it's been 4 days and I kind of start to be a little more optimistic about this attempt. We even went out for drinks yesterday and even though I really really wanted to smoke (and him as well) we both didn't.

"I'm approaching 48h, and woke up with strong cravings today, slight sadness, and an overwhelming feeling that nothing will ever replace or fill the gap left by smoking...  Right now I feel like I'm internally trying to convince myself of things I'm unsure of.

Anyone who has quit, do you genuinely enjoy life more without cigarettes?

Is there anything that you enjoy as much as cigarettes, or do you realise that you never really enjoyed them at all?",stopsmoking

"I just wanted to share with you guys that, after being a daily smoker for 19 years, smoking more than a pack a day at the end, I've now been tobacco-free for a year as of yesterday and the vaping I've replaced it with has been nicotine-free for a couple months!",stopsmoking
"Two nights ago I hopefully smoked my last cig and weed. I started smoking even though I have severe asthma about a year and a half ago, because almost everyone does it here. Even though I knew how it was, I didn't want to be left out. Almost twelve years of not smoking went down the drain.

After smoking half a pack daily for around a month and a half, I had to use my asthma can around 3 times a day, and once a night. I knew I will give up smoking for good when october starts, because I have to go back to college, and I want to lose weight/spend less money/fuck bitches. But something bad happened two nights ago, which made me realise time doesn't forgive or understand you.

I was in the bed, chillin at 4 am, having a wank. Suddenly, I had to cough. I knew I had to get up, find my can to get air. But I coughed so hard and I felt like I had so little air, I started to feel dizzy and I started to panic. I was alone, no one at home, and I felt like even thinking was making me consume air. I calmed myself down, went to open a window to get some fresh air, and thought about what happened. I felt trapped in an open cage. I got angry with myself, like how stupid are you, man? You have health problems and tons of other stuff, you want to experience a lot of things, and this is how you want to go down? You want to get killed my SMOKING? Crush those cigarettes, and don't even think about smoking another one. That's what I did.

Yesterday, almost late at night, I thought about smoking a cig. Firstly, I said no. ABSOLUTELY NO. By time, I was like yeah man, one to see how it is. Why I didn't go to the shop was distance, as the shop near me closed.

I am so pathetic, I don't know how I can go through this addiction. Relapsing thoughts are hard when I want a cig... I guess that's how natural selection picks it's people, like me.",stopsmoking

"You know what? I am happier than never before. One day I just had this realization that happiness is a choice, dear people. We choose to be happy or not. That's it. That's the post.

I'm happier than ever before, stress free, and physically better. Couldn't have done so without feeding off the positivity here. Love y'all. ‚ù§Ô∏è",stopsmoking
"Hi, it's been 20 days today, which I'm so proud of, but I just wanted to ask if anyone has some experience with everyday throat pain and in how long it goes away? I thought it would be gone by now. Few days after I guit it got much much better but since then the pain still remains and I don't want to overlook some other medical issue assuming it's smoking related.

Sore throat was one of reasons I quit because it lasted for months that time. Thanks for any thoughts, I know it's nothing serious I just wonder if someone experienced the same.",stopsmoking
"After I quit smoking I have heavy mucus in the back of my throat and sinuses, is there anything I could take to remove or dilute the mucus it‚Äôs so thick",stopsmoking

"There are a lot of situations when you want to smoke desperately, but you can't. During flights. Family dinners. Customs inspection at the border. In Airports. In Subway. Etc.   
Ironically, I realized that I can no longer smoke when there were no more obstacles between me and smoking. I was working remotely, and I was permitted to smoke as much as I want. And I enjoyed it. But only up to some point. Then pleasure turned into weariness. And this weariness was going stronger every day.   
Finally, I got a mental breakdown or something. Everything annoyed me that day. Evrything seemed ugly and pointless. I was totally unable to focus. I smoked one cigarette after another but it didn't help. Maybe before that I didn‚Äôt want to quit because I was afraid that my condition will become worse. That I will lose some pleasant moments and inspiration. But that day I realized I had nothing to lose. Except my nicotin chains, lol.  
I will be extremely glad to hear your stories!",stopsmoking

Even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs that little time it usually is. Power through that struggle for a bit and then it disappears,stopsmoking
"Thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Tomorrow is my quit day. I am ready. I won‚Äôt even finish the pack I have left. I‚Äôll smoke my last one and destroy the rest. 

I am quitting because I recognize that I hate the power they have had over my entire life for 20 years. I‚Äôm not stressed out when I can‚Äôt smoke, I‚Äôm stressed out because I smoke. 

I want to live a long life. I want to walk for two straight hours for fun, admire my beautiful teeth in the mirror, enjoy reclaimed time and productivity like a goddamn adult. I want to be free from the anxiety that comes from planning my schedule around my next fix. I want to be all the things I know I am! I am a successful, creative, resourceful, intelligent, beautiful woman and every cigarette keeps me from arriving at my true potential. 

It‚Äôs time and I am ready. I will also show up in your comments a fucking mess, but I know that is simply part of the process. Thank you for being here.",stopsmoking
"I finally am pulling the trigger again after a long time, hit the patch and suckin lollypops for the oral fixation. I genuinely think I can do it but I‚Äôve hit a roadblock I wasn‚Äôt expecting.


Has anybody else experienced severe depression when off smoking? I feel like I‚Äôm at a low I never expected when I normally am fine. It really threw me for a loop and I‚Äôm just wondering if the two are tied together in some way now that I‚Äôm off the pack a day lifestyle.",stopsmoking
"Been about 41 days smoke free and it‚Äôs not as bad as I thought it would be.

Days like today when I‚Äôm beyond stressed and that creeping thought of a cigarette in the back of my mind has become easier to handle. 

I know it‚Äôs not worth it to go to the store and get some smokes, I know I am better than that. 

I am willing to live a life free of the grip cigarettes had on me for 10 years.

I am not willing to be controlled by them ever again.

Good luck everyone we got this!",stopsmoking
