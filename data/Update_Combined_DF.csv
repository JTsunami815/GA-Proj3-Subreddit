0,"I used to sing in a band. I also have sung a lot of karaoke. I have always been a singer. I am good at it. Once I got sober though, I just stopped. It's been almost 2 years since I have sang karaoke even. Partly because of Covid but mostly because I couldn't bring myself to go into a bar and sing sober. 
Well I finally went tonight. Me and my step dad went and drank Pepsi and I sang one song. I was terrified. Shaking before I even started. I mean almost a panic attack if I would have let my emotions take over. But I love to sing I was determined. I put up my song and had to wait for like 7 people to go before me. Every time he called the next singer my heart was beating so fast and I was short of breath. It was ridiculous. I mean, I have been singing my entire life. Why was a so damn scared. Finally they call my name and I get up there. My step dad said after the first two lines of the song he was a little worried. But after that, I fucking killed it. I killed it! I was amazing. I did it, and I did it fucking sober! I can still sing and I can still sing Rock and I can still get into it. Sober!! 
Afterwards I literally grabbed my purse and I walked out. I was shaking so bad I had to move. Everyone cheered and clapped and they wanted me to sing again but one was enough. I will probably go again soon with someone from the program that sings but damn. That first song sober. It was crazy. My nerves were insane and just one shot of vodka would have calmed me right down. But I don't need that anymore.  Because of AA I know that if something terrifies me, I can do it anyway. I got a HP that is more powerful than what  booze could ever give me.

2,"In the meeting tonight this was the topic. It struck me because we fight so hard to hold on to the habits and lifestyles that completely demoralize are true authentic self . I was thinking back and wondering why so long did I hold on to the pain, was it pride or ego maybe it was the fact that I didn’t believe that life could get better. I had to do something and frankly even the bottle was getting old or should I say the same embarrassing messes I kept re-enacting hoping that one day my life would change. I person I once partied with was sober and suggested a meeting so I went. I walked into that room of 80+ alcoholics and was uncomfortable and not really taking it serious. I learned that day that I might have a slim chance of getting 1 month sober , it’s funny 1 month was my goal that was back in June 1 2018 3 + years later I was my home group and this was the topic . I did not know back then but I surrendered my old life for a brand new one and I don’t regret which team I have chosen.

9,"Hi all :)
I (31F) am looking for a sponsor. I live in the UK.
I currently have 24 days sober.

I previously have had a sponsor who let me go unexpectedly yesterday, so I have a grasp on the 12 steps and how it works. I have a copy of the blue book. I have not began any steps yet. I have attended multiple zoom meetings and try to do this at least once a day.
I currently work full time as a nurse and also have a disability. It had previously been suggested that I was not taking my recovery seriously enough due to not being able to commit to daily phone calls at specific times, gratitude lists being shared before 10am everyday, not making calls to 2 people from the WhatsApp group every day, meditating every day etc .

I found the approach quite overwhelming and I physically or mentally could not reach my previous sponsor's expectations which upset me. She was very helpful and insightful.
I am a chilled and laid back person but I am still serious about remaining sober and it means so much to me. Perhaps an strategy/arrangement with less obligations/duties will be less stress inducing and more achievable due to my lifestyle and current circumstances. If such a pathway exists and is attainable I would be so happy. 
I understand the importance of a sponsor and im worried if I go this alone I may falter. 

I apologise if this isn't the right place to seek a sponsor - if that is the case then any point in the right direction would be very valuable to me. Face to face meetings would be a good place to find a sponsor but I cannot routinely attend these like I can with Zoom. People on Zoom do offer sponsorship but I mostly attend American meetings and I feel logistically due to time zones a sponsor from UK would mean I can commit more and less likely to let anyone down.

11,"Its hard for me to quit because its like a form of self harm to binge drink, and when I want to quit, its because I care about my health, but I don't have anyone in my life who cares about me. So I often don't see the point and have a hard time when I get an emotional trigger. I am no contact from my entire family who are devoutly religious and do not care that a family member sexually abused me, and are all narcissistic in that they did not care and did not protect me, they have all protected my abuser. I have struggled with systematic abuse and abusive living situations and poverty ever since I escaped my family of origin. My abuser also stalked me for four years using his police position till I finally threatened legal action if it did not stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I often feel like no one would care if i did, I am the only one who cares if I live or die, but I am also terrified of living and dying, I am scared I will always be alone. And I am scared because I can't do it on my own, I have tried to quit on my own, and just can't do it, I am not stronger than this addiction and I wish I was. I wish I never drank in the first place. 

What happens at these AA meetings? Has anyone ever made friends or found sponsers at the meetings? I know its not a groupies meet up, but I do feel I would be stronger being around people who understand me that I can talk to. I feel so alone and I have avoided AA meetings because I am scared to even admit I have a problem but I have a problem. My stomach hurts, and I feel sick. How can I get over this hang over?

I'm not using him as an excuse, but I know he was part of the problem. 
Nowadays I can't drink responsibly, if that's even a thing, recently I've been letting drinking get the best of me. Drinking has become my routine, every day after work, to the point of getting the shakes if I don't. 
My fiancé drinks too. I've asked her to stop or not keep any alcohol at home, but she's fought me on the subject every time. 
I love her more than life itself, but I can't continue down this path. I can't be a source of stress to her anymore, I want to stop!! The last time I got so drunk and lost in my thoughts, while she was trying to gelp me up, I swung my arns trying to get up and hit her face!! Something I've never done nor would I ever think about!! Now she has this painful, visible reminder of my behavior. I apologized a thousand times and she assured me I didn't do it on purpose, but I still did hurt her and that's killing me right now.
I don't want to drink ever again, but how can I do it if there's alcohol in the house? 
I poured it all out this morning, at least I thought I did,  but she had kept a few cans in the bedroom and asked me to please not throw them away. I'm afraid to take it away from her, cause I don't want her going out of her way to find a drink, if she's going to drink, I'd rather she does it at home, safely.

There is a direct linkage among self-examination, meditation, and prayer.  Taken separately, these practices can bring much relief and benefit.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 98

If I do my self-examination first, then surely, I'll have enough humility to pray and meditate - because I'll see and feel my need for them.  Some wish to begin and end with prayer, leaving the self-examination and meditation to take place in between, whereas others start with meditation, listening for advice from God about their still hidden or unacknowledged defects.  Still others engage in written and verbal work on their defects, ending with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.  These three - self-examination, meditation and prayer - form a circle, without a beginning or an end.  No matter where, or how, I start, I eventually arrive at my destination: a better life.

“When we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed crisis we could not postpone or evade, we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either God is everything or else He is nothing. God either is, or He isn’t” Alcoholics Anonymous pg 53.

The program of Alcoholics Anonymous is not about me, demonstrating to God what I can do. It’s about God demonstrating through me what He can do. My sponsee is locked up, decided to take his will back. A member of my home group was found dead on Sunday. He had an 8 year old daughter. 2 other members of I know passed away from the disease in October.

Whenever I see the worst of our disease, I love to read this passage found in Appendix II in the far back:

“Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual concepts. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial. We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program. WILLINGNESS, HONESTY and OPEN MINDEDNESS are the essentials of recovery. But these are indispensable.” Alcoholics Anonymous pg. 568",alcoholicsanonymous, became alcoholic crushed selfimposed crisis could postpone evade fearlessly face proposition either god everything else nothing god either alcoholic anonymous pg 53 program alcoholic anonymous demonstrating god god demonstrating sponsee locked decided take back member home group found dead sunday 8 year old daughter 2 member know passed away disease october whenever see worst disease love read passage found appendix ii far back emphatically wish say alcoholic capable honestly facing problem light experience recover provided close mind spiritual concept defeated attitude intolerance belligerent denial find one need difficulty spirituality program willingness honesty open mindedness essential recovery indispensable alcoholic anonymous pg 568

43,"So I've been in recovery for a little over 4 months now and as the title suggests I have a few questions about recovery and its effects on sexual activity. For the record, I'm a 29 yr male. So the number one thing I've noticed is my extreme sensitivity during sexual activity as compared to during my active addiction. Again gonna try to be not over the top but still get my point across. During my addiction I would have plenty of stamina in terms of endurance until completion, almost to a point of sometimes not completing period. Now after a few months of recovery, it seems like my sexual activity has swung in the other direction. I now frequently last to a minute if that. While I still maintain an erection, this has been mildly vexing in its consistency and such extreme in the opposite pattern. So my questions are is this something others (not just males) have experienced? Do others have experience with this tappering off and normalizing? Any advice for dealing with this? Still with my partner of past 4 years so partner is consistent. As is porn usage although just to experiment I have lowered it, although it was a healthy level before.

Not drinking alcohol for this long is something I haven't done for half of my life and I'm very grateful for getting to learn who I am again and getting to improve my life.

49,"KEEPING OPTIMISM AFLOAT

The other Steps can keep most of us sober and somehow functioning.  But Step Eleven can keep us growing...

- THE LANGUAGE OF THE HEART, p. 240

A sober alcoholic finds it much easier to be optimistic about life.  Optimism is the natural result of my finding myself gradually able to make the best, rather than the worst, of each situation.  As my physical sobriety continues, I come out of the fog, gain a clearer perspective and am better able to determine what courses of action to take.  As vital as physical sobriety is, I can achieve a greater potential for myself by developing an ever-increasing willingness to avail myself of the guidance and direction of a Higher Power.  My ability to do so comes from my learning - and practicing - the principles of the A.A. program.  The melding of my physical and spiritual sobriety produces the substance of a more positive life.

53,"🌟trigger warning. Abuse and recovery 🌟

Knowing everything happens for a reason and I’m exactly where I need to be living on life’s terms really does take a lot of the overcomplication out of my life.
8 ish years ago I was in a women’s refuge, had been born into abuse and had thought my only worth was be treat like shit on the daily as it was all I new. Not one person in my life was a positive influence so how could I be a positive influence? It’s something learnt. The abuse spiralled when I hit my late teens and I ended up thinking it was normal to be treat like a prisoner. I fell into clear co dependent issues and Daily witnessings of my abuser torturing animals, having no way out. Not even a phone and being threatened to have petrol poured down my throat while my shoes were taken . Daily abuse was in the cycle and I knew they meant what they said with threats because their actions showed it. 
I never learnt how to understand myself or process emotions. I was a jittery mess and had no where to turn. Would be panicking all day every day and struggled with thoughts of suicide. The day I started rebuilding my life I called the police and was moved into a hotel with a bag of stuff. I didn’t have much, just some basic clothes. Ended up doing a course that taught me how to recognise certain triggers (through women’s aid) somehow I managed to have jobs through this , although sparse and I tried to just study as much as I could too. 
Unfortunately it was challenging and the guilt and shame of it all used to eat away and I really spiralled with alcohol- started young on this too. The alcohol became the main constant in my life and I felt I had some security in this. I never drank in the mornings or at work so that was my perfect excuse to fuel it. I didn’t want therapy because I didn’t want to have to relive it all again. Every time I tried to rebuild my life I didn’t understand how to communicate properly as I’d been used to a certain way of living and it was difficult. Every time I had people showing any emotion (anger/happy) I struggled understanding and I just kept spiralling. Soon enough I kept getting told regularly to think before I speak. I wanted to but didn’t know how and it was a constant pattern of self sabotage. 
In the end I spoke out after keeping it all in. Somehow it felt a bit better. I didn’t realise until I started getting therapy and recovery the importance of speaking out as it sets you free from the baggage of your past. Tbh I didn’t even think I’d ever be able to comfortably write this . But the thing is this post isn’t for attention or any one to feel bad by this. This is for the silent suffering addict that is pretending everything is ok. Get in recovery and the work the program. Happiness isn’t man made by alcohol etc and feeling genuinely happy is a thing. We all have a story to tell and being able to see the growth in my journey is just lessons I needed to learn . I am starting to recognise my own defects of character and being able to work on this is what sets me free. Anyone’s opinions on my life does not matter and I can’t change what people think of me. All I know is I’m exactly where I need to be right now and I’m not having to try and control my life anymore. 
As times going on all the positives are showing like light bulb moments and being able to understand myself more and more every day is a blessing and I wouldn’t of been able to do it without recovery. I surround my life with as many positives as I can and recovery and give you it all in abundance. I have people in my life I trust and they trust me, I have a stable job that I try to push myself to take all the rewards I can handle because I know it’s the complete opposite of my past. People don’t like me and that’s ok, I’m not in this world to question why or beat myself up over it. I meditate, write gratitudes and try to constantly take in all the growth I can get now and try to learn to the best of my abilities

54,"So I’m 26, and I would say on the outside I have a lot going for me career wise. However, for so many years now I’ve been drinking so much. Not just socially, but I’ve definitely been that functional alcoholic. No one knows how bad it is besides my ex because he lived with me and saw me have weeks where I drank everyday. Alcohol has definitely affected our relationship and he has told me over and over how it changes me. I hear him, but I realized when I’m here in State A I drink. When I go back home to State B I don’t even think about alcohol. I don’t crave it, even in social settings I won’t take a sip. It was recently my birthday and in State B during a celebration dinner, I didn’t drink. Because of my control in State B, I know I haven’t reached the worst levels of alcoholism. However, I know it’s there. Last night I reached an all time low. I not only drank but I lose my self worth, and do things I’m not proud of. I go through all the emotions that comes with drunk guilt, but I keep putting myself in the same situation. I know many people would say, hey just move out of State A. Yeah, I probably should but I’m in a position that I can’t right now. I don’t know what it is about being in this state, but my worst self always comes out. I’ve never been to AA, I’m scared because of judgment in my career. I care way too much about other’s opinions. Life is rough, sure. But I really don’t have room to complain. I can recognize my privileges and the blessings I have. I just don’t understand why after so many years, so many mistakes, I can’t find the will the change. Why can’t I control myself in this State.

Thinking about drinking? Work the 1st step.

Feeling hopeless? Work the 2nd step.

Expectations not being met? Work the 3rd step.

Etc.

At 12 I was laying in my bed and I woke up at 6 am (the first thing I remember after the blackout) and tried to drink water, which I immediately vomited out again. Then I went back to sleep and I did this about three more times, every time feeling a little better afterwards.

62,"       I’m a 28 Year old male who is hooked on chewing tobacco. Since I was of legal age to use nicotine products. I’ve quit cigarettes and dip and then come back to the habit countless times. I prefer chew because you can do it anywhere whereas with the other there are more restrictions. In May of this year I relocated from CO to N.J, acclimated myself to the A.A community here and got a sponsor. Overall  I feel like I’m having more success in my Recovery than I have in the last 6 years of being in and out of the rooms. I’ve finally made it to Step Ten and I’ve got 8 months of continuous sobriety. 
          However I’ve noticed that my habit is taboo and that it makes people feel uncomfortable. I use a portable spittoon called a “Mudjug” where you can’t see inside of it and it’s odorless. My goal is to meet and be closer to new people to make friends (and this is definitely happening) but it seems obvious to me that this habit interferes with my ability to connect with others. 
      The truth is I despise this addiction myself. I think it’s nasty too and I feel like crap after and sometimes during use as well as getting headaches and having to go to the restroom often because of it.  But I’m very much hooked on the “nic fix” and feel like the flow of nicotine in my bloodstream keeps me wired and going. It is a strong stimulant for me and just like with drugs and alcohol, it satisfies an “itch” that I have. I also worry about getting cancer at some point. The fear of going without any stimulant at all scares me, but I reason that if I got off the drugs then I can do this too. I’ve set my quit date to December 1st.

70,"Two of the things that have held me (23F) back from quitting are:

1. Being not ready to give up alcohol forever.
2. Going on this ""sobriety journey"" while still living with my family where I have no privacy and I have to live these things out in the open.

So, on the day I finally decided not to drink anymore (Oct 3), at least for a while, I used the excuse of Sober October. That way, I wouldn't have to reconcile the thought of a life without alcohol, and I could pretend to my family that this is just a trendy, temporary change, not a whole new identity or whatever.

I'm proud of myself for having gone 4 weeks AF. I haven't been sober for that long since before I started drinking. 

I'm taking it day by day. I miss it, so badly, but it's been surprisingly manageable (don't get me wrong, I still smoke a ton of weed) and my family has been supportive without being suffocating.

So, I'm going to keep going. I don't know for how long. But that has made today really difficult as I feel I am starting this process of grieving the loss of my favorite pastime, most effective medicine, best buddy, etc. Also, next time I decline alcohol at home, they'll realize it's an ongoing (""permanent""?!) thing, and it'll be so Official. Of course, I know deep down that I don't want the accountability- if no one knows I quit, then when I inevitably relapse, everyone will know I failed instead of just me.

71,"Change playmates and playgrounds AA suggested. The title is an example of the result of doing so.

A number of years ago I started experiencing symptoms of heart disease, chest pain walking my dog. started into pay-as you go medical treatment without insurance. Could see I was headed for some bankrupting expenses. 

Called on an AA friend, an accountant who had had some heart work done. He stopped whatever he was doing and got on the phone. Having good recovery, he thought nothing of putting my problem ahead of his work for the time being. For the same reason and having more clarity of thought than I, not being  threatened with the seemingly unsurmountable problem, he had some optimism and looked for facts to support it. His doctor suggested that I visit the medical education clinic of a particular good teaching hospital.  I did. I was accepted as a patient and treated like royalty as far as I was concerned. as it happened my resident had other business the day of my  angioplasty  with stent and one of the big guns with his name on the letterhead actually did the procedure. although I'm sure the intern would have done as good of job. I recovered completely and was back to work and life quickly. I paid $83,34/ month for a year for everything.

Years have passed and I started experiencing heart problems again. This time with Medicare and supplemental insurance I now pay for, I chose the same hospital, one for their excellent reputation and service and two to repay their generosity from years ago.

I doubt if a guy on the the next bar stool would have set me on the same track as my accountant who used to drink too much, just like me.",alcoholicsanonymous,change playmate playground aa suggested title example result number year ago started experiencing symptom heart disease chest pain walking dog started payas go medical treatment without insurance could see headed bankrupting expense called aa friend accountant heart work done stopped whatever got phone good recovery thought nothing putting problem ahead work time reason clarity thought threatened seemingly unsurmountable problem optimism looked fact support doctor suggested visit medical education clinic particular good teaching hospital accepted patient treated like royalty far concerned happened resident business day angioplasty stent one big gun name letterhead actually procedure although im sure intern would done good job recovered completely back work life quickly paid 8334 month year everything year passed started experiencing heart problem time medicare supplemental insurance pay chose hospital one excellent reputation service two repay generosity year ago doubt guy next bar stool would set track accountant used drink much like

77,"So recently I called my sponsor to give him my daily check-ins and he stopped me halfway through and said “Look, (my name), I haven’t been 100% honest with you. I don’t actually have two years sober. Tomorrow I will have one year.” He went on to say that when he was in sober living a year prior from the day of this phone call, he had gone out and used heroin and crack and was scrambling for fake pee to pass a UA. At the time, I told him he was still my sponsor and I thanked him for telling me. Once we got off the phone, though, I started questioning his credibility as a sponsor. He asked me to give him his one year chip that following day at a meeting. Now he’s going around and telling the people who have been affected by him living in this year-long lie. But I’m starting to notice he is getting short with me. He wants me to wake up at a certain time every day, do the daily reflection every day, and write down 5 things Im grateful for. I admit my fault, when i first wake up in the morning i wanna do stuff that is fun, not the meditation and 5 things i’m grateful for. and i also enjoy staying up late with my housemates and watching movies so getting up at the same time every morning is annoying. So yes, my fault i have been slipping with that. I’m 19 and i’m human. i make mistakes. Not excusable but reasonable. Anyways I admitted I lied to him yesterday about it and he got pissed. There was even a point where he called me just to yell and scream at me, and the second i tried to talk after letting him rant and chew me out, I just hear *beep beep beep*. I started wondering why he was so short with me yesterday and I remembered he is in the process of telling people he had not been living an honest program for a year. I also realized I have the self respect finally to draw the line where I’ll tolerate how people treat me, and yelling at me over the phone and not letting me talk is something I don’t deserve.

78,"Hello everyone, my (37F) husband(39M) has a drinking problem.  He is sober on days that he works and is an amazingly sweet man but on his days off he decides he needs to make up for lost time drinking.  In the past he used to openly drink 2 bottles of wine, 3 large beers and half a fifth of vodka.  He would usually start at 9:00 am and be passed out dead drunk by 2:00 pm.  He would become horribly aggressive and obnoxious to the point I couldn’t wait for him to pass out so I could have a normal stress free day.  I told him he had to stop drinking when I became pregnant with our first daughter as I didn’t want a fall down drunk around our newborn baby.  He lied to me and never stopped.  I’ve caught him twice now drinking vodka in secret and dumped it in front of him warning him I would leave if he did it again.  Well, he’s found a new hiding spot for his booze and will throughout the day take swigs of it but not get drunk to the point of passing out, just being aggressive and obnoxious.  Last night we were at his parents condo to celebrate Halloween and they could tell he was drunk right away.  I have high functioning ASD so I have a hard time identifying subtle changes so to me he was acting weird but I wasn’t thinking drunk.  We weren’t there 10 min before he starts a fight with his stepdad over not being able to get medical marijuana for free like a mooch from his stepdads supply.  It got so bad that he was scaring our 3.5 yr old daughter that she was shaking in her Elsa dress and clinging to my MIL for dear life while I told him to knock it off.  We were kicked out and he basically scream cried the whole drive home driving like a crazy person on trick or treat streets.  I immediately decided I can’t deal with his lies and selfishness about drinking because he feels entitled to a drink on his days off.  I’m wanting to know how to get him to see he’s hit rock bottom and to get help from AA?  I want to leave and just take my daughter with me back to our home state but he’s already threatened me with kidnapping charges if I do that.   I’m also pregnant right now with a high risk pregnancy so I can’t leave on a plane right now.  It could be a year until I can implement my leave him for a few months until he gets help plan.  What else can I do in the meantime to thwart his drinking?  Please help.  I’m desperate.  We’re even planning to not invite him to holidays so our daughter can have happy memories and not these hateful drunkard ruining every birthday and holiday memories that she  currently has because of his selfishness.",alcoholicsanonymous,hello everyone 37f husband39m drinking problem sober day work amazingly sweet man day decides need make lost time drinking past used openly drink 2 bottle wine 3 large beer half fifth vodka would usually start 900 passed dead drunk 200 pm would become horribly aggressive obnoxious point wait pas could normal stress free day told stop drinking became pregnant first daughter want fall drunk around newborn baby lied never stopped caught twice drinking vodka secret dumped front warning would leave well found new hiding spot booze throughout day take swig get drunk point passing aggressive obnoxious last night parent condo celebrate halloween could tell drunk right away high functioning asd hard time identifying subtle change acting weird thinking drunk 10 min start fight stepdad able get medical marijuana free like mooch stepdads supply got bad scaring 35 yr old daughter shaking elsa dress clinging mil dear life told knock kicked basically scream cried whole drive home driving like crazy person trick treat street immediately decided deal lie selfishness drinking feel entitled drink day wanting know get see hit rock bottom get help aa want leave take daughter back home state already threatened kidnapping charge also pregnant right high risk pregnancy leave plane right could year implement leave month get help plan else meantime thwart drinking please help desperate even planning invite holiday daughter happy memory hateful drunkard ruining every birthday holiday memory currently selfishness

I am so grateful that after four years of sobriety, I was able to come that close and still walk away. The smell of wine sent a chill down my body, like I just smelled rubbing alcohol.

85,"Hi All,

I posted this in another sub reddit, while getting some advice and researching AA. I stumbled across this and thought I would post here as I have some questions.

I am 40 year old male; I have a really good job that is classed as one of the most stressful jobs in the world. I have a wife and family and friends. I never drank in the week, mainly because I cannot function the day after. But come Friday after work, I could easerly drink half a litre if vodka or 10 beers and get smashed! Of course, I thought, it was just my down time from work. I would then get in fights, do really really stupid stuff when out and be.....well......honestly..... a total bellend. I would then identity this is wrong, identity the drink as the problem. Go through a circle of guilt, anguish and embrassiment. I would stop drinking for a month and then start all over again. This weekend, the same thing has happened again. I am now 3 days from event in question, writing this, with my head in my hands in embarrassment. I cannot, I mean cannot continue with this cycle in my life as deep down, I am just a shy, big hearted nice guy. This funking ass that comes out when drunk......I hate, it is not me and I don't want to be this person any more. It is time to grow up and take some responsibility of my actions. Step 1  stop drinking for ever.

My question; 

1.does the above sound familiar to anyone? If so, how did you fix it?

2. What do you do with your spear time? I fear that if I don't occupie my self I will fail again.

3. AA; how can I make contact with a local group to get support?

4. What type of meetings are there? Is there a beginners one? 

Sorry if this comes across as a ramble, but my head is a mess right now, I I just looking for some advice.

88,"I have been thinking about alcohol and how it relates to other things to do and I would to start a discussion. I am going to share.

I think have gotten pleasure of enjoying perhaps an hour or two when I drank alcohol. It took that edge off. An escape from feeling like I was living a life clocking in to do things I hated. I connect with a person over a bottle that under everyday circumstances I couldn't connect with. I got to go to a place of singing, dancing and talking. Things I love. When I moved into my house. The feelings of being in love way surpassed that bottle feeling.

Alcohol nearly always caused a black out and stress the next day. When I had first started drinking I thought it was entertaining to wake up and a person would tell a story about all the funny things that happened. Years later, my mom started to tell one of those stories. And I looked at her and said my drinking must for somebody else to see because it were to know about then I wouldn't be blacking out? If I was supposed to experience what was happening I would of remembered it or been there.  That was a moment..an ephipany moment. Why would I do all that for an hour or two of a connection and then lose all that time to darkness and wake up feeling sick the next day. It didn't cause me to feel good anymore to hear stories that I did ever know even happened. And if they did, I was gone. So, why did it matter? 

How does it relate to now? When I talk with a person and think they are giving another made up story I feel sad cause I don't connect either it's a story and if it is not I wasn't there. 

What I wish is that we were both here. Enjoying each other.",alcoholicsanonymous,thinking alcohol relates thing would start discussion going share think gotten pleasure enjoying perhaps hour two drank alcohol took edge escape feeling like living life clocking thing hated connect person bottle everyday circumstance couldnt connect got go place singing dancing talking thing love moved house feeling love way surpassed bottle feeling alcohol nearly always caused black stress next day first started drinking thought entertaining wake person would tell story funny thing happened year later mom started tell one story looked said drinking must somebody else see know wouldnt blacking supposed experience happening would remembered momentan ephipany moment would hour two connection lose time darkness wake feeling sick next day didnt cause feel good anymore hear story ever know even happened gone matter relate talk person think giving another made story feel sad cause dont connect either story wasnt wish enjoying
89,"It’s 5am where I am now and I’m suffering from insomnia effects plus hungover from a night of drinking. I have work in the morning and it’s not going to be lovely. So far I still have it together, like last week when I know I’ll be busy with work I’d stop myself from drinking for a few days. I was craving for alcohol, but I was able to control myself. I’ve not blacked out from drinking ever really, but I have driven home (10+ minute drive) under the influence that I passed straight out after I got home. I’ve also intentionally starved myself because its easier to get drunk while hungry.

When I say I’m suffering from ‘a night of drinking’ it wasn’t very accurate. It’s been a three day trance, and I’ve been drinking like this almost every weekend. I’ve set rules for myself that I’ll drink only on weekends, but lately I’m having strong desire to break that rule and drink like this every day. Hell, I thrive better on alcohol anyways, I’m more talkative, less socially awkward, happier, more motivated, braver, everything. But I’m scared. My partner’s extremely pissed off at me for drinking like this. I’ve told them to please not take my alcohol away because they did it once and I’m horrified of how angry that made me feel. My home is a mess because I’ve got no energy to clean things up. I’ve dropped 10+ pounds in this past month just from starving myself so I can drink better. I don’t want to stop, I know I can’t and won’t stop, parts of me thinks the fact that I can just not drink when I know I have things to do and I’ve never blacked out makes me feel like I might not have a problem. Meanwhile other parts of my body, my life and my partner are all screaming otherwise. 

I’m not sure if I should stop or keep drinking to see how this plays out.

That might not sound particularly bad, but for me, it’s traumatizing coming out of it. I was out for an hour or two. My roommates took care of me so I’m okay, but I’m terrified.

94,"I CANNOT CHANGE THE WIND

It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels.  We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

My first sponsor told me there were two things to say about prayer and meditation: first, I had to start and second, I had to continue.  When I came to A.A. my spiritual life was bankrupt; if I considered God at all, He was to be called upon only when my self-will was incapable of a task or when overwhelming fears had eroded my ego.  Today I am grateful for a new life, one in which my prayers are those of thanksgiving.  My prayer time is more for listening than for talking.  I know today that if I cannot change the wind, I can adjust my sail.  I know the difference between superstition and spirituality.  I know there is a graceful way of being right, and many ways to be wrong.

97,"I’ve decided to share my experience with my alcoholism and addiction, in hopes that someone struggling will be able to relate, or at least let the hopeless addict who may read this know that they are not alone. With that said, I’ll begin by saying that I had turbulent childhood. My mother was incarcerated at an early age, and I was in and out of homes, dealt with a lot of trauma, as well as some decent stints of incarceration and homeless as a teenager. I started drinking at 12, smoking pot at 13, and was using needles by 14. Being a homeless at that age is very hard. I was sleeping under bridges, stealing food and trying to not get killed.The general formality of my childhood left a king size chipped on my shoulder. I was running the streets and eventually landed in a juvy center in which I had been in and out of several times before but this time I wasn’t getting out for about 16 months. It probably saved my life. When I got out I legitimately wanted to do good. My mother had been recently released from prison and I seriously cared about nothing more at the time than just being able to be with my mother. It quickly went to shit as she was an addict also, and just happen to be a phlebotomist. Before long she was helping me hit. I was a trash can at that point ,  was pushing mdma and heroin into my veins whenever I could, holding a shitty payed under the table job. She was back into prison pretty quickly. I spent 16-19 holding a job and working my way up , beating a heroin addiction but only to replace it with drinking and smoking pot excessively. At 19 I was raided by swat, suffering grave injuries from the raid. I was selling a lot of weed and mdma at the time, the only thing they didn’t take from me that day was my Coinbase account which luckily had enough funds for me to get a good defense and live off of for a little bit after I got out of jail. I was so gravely injured that I didn’t have to sit for very long, but it took me a year to learn how to walk again and by that time I had no body. At the time I honestly had just wished they killed me. I signed for ten probation, stayed out of trouble for a while and did everything I could to try and get my life back on track, But I was never willing to stop drinking and before I knew it I would cause anyone who would come to love me leave due to my excessive Xanax use and drinking. When I was 25 I had managed to hold a pretty high position with the company I worked for and my Roomate was just as bad as I was about drinking. I still as an adult was not willing to leave the street mentality behind and ended up back in jail here and there, but always could hire attorneys and just barely scrape by without getting really fucked . My life was in shambles, everyone I had used to see at party’s I only saw at funerals by then. I got a call  one of my last childhood friends had died one day after work. I was very close to her family and her, as they took me in when I was a homeless 13 year old living on the streets. I decided I should go check up on her mother and when I went over everyone was using heroin and me in my drunken state decided that was my sign. Never stopped using it, got fired , and was pretty hopeless. Decided I was going to start my own company, and got to it. But my addiction made me isolate literally as much as possible. Once I got a taste of some decent money, I graduated from heroin and Xanax to fentanyl and morphine analogs. This went on for about a year, many over doses , many trips to the hospital. I was ready to die. I won’t go into too great of detail, but I was constantly alone and doing everything in my power to kill myself. I couldn’t go without a couple of hours without poking myself, and ended up eating around ten Xanax bars a day. There’s literally many months and months of my life I do not remember. I don’t care too either.. I was using while I was out driving around and had one particular overdose in my truck in a parking lot that was within minutes of taking my life when I was narcaned. This was my life. I ended up getting a dwi in a parking lot while parked and back into fucking jail again. This time my lawyer took my money got me out and then told me he was gonna take my money and call it even for getting me out of jail, not represent me for my case unless I went to detox. Without the funds to hire a real defense I was not left with very many options. I so desperately wanted to get sober already, and figured I would just give it a try. Shot half a gram of dope ate a handful of Xanax asked my ex which I had lost in my addiction to please watch my dog, and was out to detox. Only problem was when you mix Xanax alcohol and heroin your liable to overdose, which I did. Woke up back in a hospital that my poor ex had taken me to because I fell out on the way to detox (I thought I was in detox  when i woke up there lol) and eventually by the grace of god a detox employee came and got me. Those 6 days were hell, as I’m sure y’all are too familiar with. Had a seizure, the subs werent helping at all because of the analogs, and I slept about 8 hours total. 1 hour here maybe another hour there, never more than a hour at once. On the sixth day my lawyer called me and told me he wanted me into rehab or he I would be in prison. There was no way I was going to go, and when asked why he didn’t tell me this is the beginning his answer was “because you wouldn’t have gone to detox had I told you”. He was right, and I’m so grateful for it. I didn’t want to work the program at all, the way I looked at it was like it’s just easy time. A couple weeks in when I started to feel okay I decided I better get my ass to work. I wanted to have some sort of fighting chance. I prayed and prayed. It wasn’t easy time at all. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired, I couldn’t help but to look back at all the fucking chaos in my life and it made me so sick. It still does. There was no fucking reason for things to be so damn hard. I had seriously always searched for answers, I wanted to know why my childhood was the way it was. Why my mother did what she did, why my father did what he did , why every fucking body did what they did. Never once did I look for those answers within myself. The old search only caused more paint and way more questions. I did not make anything easier on anyone. I needed to find myself. I completed rehab, got out and managed to salvage my business, get the woman I love back and fucking for once in my life experience it without any mind altering substances. I started a strong program with AA, and was fully ready to surrender. In the beginning I still kinda wanted to die, as I had made choices and decisions that I was never supposed to live long enough for to see the consequences. AA as given to me what I couldn’t possibly obtain myself. The program has made me a better man and sobriety is just a side effect. My mother never got that chance. I find myself now getting ready to start with a mentoring program to go back to the same facilities I was locked up in as a gun toting teenager to go and try to help kids now. Every fucking day I get to wake up sober. Every day I get the choice to either help someone else or sit in my own shit, and I refuse to do the latter any longer. I do believe life is a big gratitude test, I still have a lot of shit hanging over my head (prison is still a real possibility, Roomate mentioned earlier died last week   ) but for every 1000 things I have to bitch about I have at least one thing to be grateful for.  Like they say one day at a time. I didn’t write this trying to sound like a victim, I wrote this out in hopes that it may touch one person and to let you know that I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL!!!

100,"Hello all, my girlfriend has a serious drinking problem and it’s killing her, and it’s killing me to see happen. I’m done enabling her shit, we went to the hospital earlier today for some serious health issues and the only thing wrong with her was what the alcohol was doing to her. 

I’ve been awake for two days keeping an eye on her literally constantly, she hasn’t left my sight for two days. And before we went to the hospital she had a glass of wine and half a beer. When they tested her, her BAC came back as 0.4 (no, not a typo). From a single glass of wine and half a beer. 

The only thing the doctors said was that it was killing her, and it’s the only thing that is wrong. But the second we got home she was drinking again, and obviously we got into a fight about it. 

I want to help her, I want to be there for her. I’ve had my own struggle with alcoholism, I know this isn’t an easy thing to do. But she’s choosing the beer over me, and it’s hurtful. 

When I tell her that she gets inconsolable. She won’t be sober long enough to have a conversation about this, and I just don’t know what to do. When I try to help give her the coping skills I used to have a healthy relationship with alcohol, she just has no interest in them and begs me to go buy her beer instead. And as ashamed as I am to admit it, I would. 

Any advice is appreciated, but mostly I just need to vent.",alcoholicsanonymous,hello girlfriend serious drinking problem killing killing see happen done enabling shit went hospital earlier today serious health issue thing wrong alcohol awake two day keeping eye literally constantly left sight two day went hospital glass wine half beer tested bac came back 04 typo single glass wine half beer thing doctor said killing thing wrong second got home drinking obviously got fight want help want struggle alcoholism know easy thing choosing beer hurtful tell get inconsolable sober long enough conversation know try help give coping skill used healthy relationship alcohol interest begs go buy beer instead ashamed admit would advice appreciated mostly need vent

105,"This is a long post but i wanted to be detailed in everything going on and my feelings:

I am 7 months sober, and take ADHD medicine that for me and my recovery and HP- i know my intentions in taking my meds are in no way for any other reason but for ADHD symptoms. I have never abused it and am very honest with ny self and ny HP when i take it to be sure I'm in right intentions for my sobriety. With that said honestly said..

So a while back when my SO (and the absolute love of my life and sober partner) and I first started dating he asked me about my sobriety and if I was taking substances at all. I have kind of learned from past experiences about telling people about me taking Adderall as prescribed and being judged in my recovery and didn’t want him to do that or doubt that I was honestly sober because he personally wouldn’t be able to take this medicine and consider himself sober- he was really insistent on how he needs to be with someone who is completely sober and can’t be with someone who isn’t or is taking things he doesn’t consider in sobriety.

When he asked me, I at the time wasn’t on it nor had been for a day or so, and didn’t have any left because I ran out and was still figuring out finding a new doctor 
 (I moved states).
So, in fear of him judging my sobriety, not wanting to be with me or have a relationship with me because of fear and trusting me, not understanding why I take it and how I don’t abuse it, just making his own conclusions and basing our relationship future off of a difference in opinions with my medicine and not allowing us to continue one or have trust because I take it- I didn’t bring up that I had still taken it in sobriety or that I was still planning on taking it eventually in the future.

I did it out of fear of losing him being misunderstood with my ADHD diagnosis and how i manage my symptoms, judgement of my recovery and sobriety and me personally. Plus, we had just started our relationship. So in my head it wasn’t that I wanted to lie or keep something from him, I just wasn’t ready to tell him about taking meds yet, I wanted to wait until we were more into our relationship and created more of a foundation of trust and love- I thought that then I would be able to have shown him how strong my recovery/sobriety is and how he can trust me entirely and trust my sobriety and we could talk about me being able to take my meds and understand how that doesn’t affect my recovery. 
I figured he’d be able to still love me and believe me later when I told him finally. I was so afraid he would get scared and leave or give up because I know he’s ultimately protecting his sobriety and his life above all else which is the most important. And I understand how being with someone who takes substances is a no no and very scary for him.

But I felt worse and worse about keeping this one thing from him, I finally  talked and was open to him about me taking it. 

He wasn’t happy, upset that I wasn’t completely honest and transparent from the get go, I explained why I was fearful and took responibility for where was wrong cuz I was- he says he understands. 
He loves me a lot and was hurt on that- and told me he can’t be with someone who takes controlled substances for his own sobriety. So I ultimately made him sad, wasn’t as understood as I hoped to be about my meds, and have to choose between being with him or taking my medication.

I told him I choose him, and I don’t want him to still have lost trust in me, or feel any future doubt or inability to be with me now that he knows I have taken it recently and used it at all- and I don’t want him to fear our relationship whether or not I take it was based on me lying. I don’t know if hell wholeheartedly be able to trust me, and I also don’t know if I can just stop taking this medicine and that is fair either.

 I don’t want to be on this medication forever, I need to find a doctor here and willing to find other solutions for meds, but I have them now and they help me, and I wish I hadn’t told him because everything I thought would happen kind of did, not to extremes at all, but I hurt him, he is worried a little and needs to think this over if we can get passed it, and ultimately he wouldn’t have known I was taking it- because it doesn’t change who I am and id taken it around him before I ran out- and none of this would have happened and I wouldn’t have hurt or worried him for no reason.

But I hated omiting truth to him, and if were a team I needed to be completely honest sooner than later and hope he’d understand, and I think he’s trying to on the why I kept it from him part- but now I don’t know how to make things better with him, im scared I messed things up, I don’t want to lie to him and take my medicine without telling him, I want us to get back to where we were in our feeling for one another and love and trust, and I am so scared we won’t be able to.

I don’t know how I should feel, im so sad I hurt him, im afraid to lose him, and I don’t know how to handle the medication situation and if I strait up need to choose him over taking helpful meds until I can change them- or if in this situation, its okay to maybe not involve him in my medication stuff. I don’t know if im completely in the wrong, and I don’t know what to do from here between us. 

I did a 10th step on this and am surrendering this over and know I'm powerless over his feelings and decisions about our relationship and future and my recovery  in his eyes. But I'm so afraid to lose him, omit truth, be judged, etc and don't know how to resolve this.

107,"I fell off the wagon last night. On a positive note, I didn't get drunk nor did I have a hang over. Usually I over do it and sleep on the floor in the rest room. I consider this a small victory. I didn't lose complete control, I didn't drink and drive, nor did I go back to get more. I've been trying for a while to stop, the most I was going was 5 days or less with out whiskey. I'm proud of those 21 days. Here are some things that I noticed about being sober.

- I saved a lot of money in October, around $500, maybe more. I smoke more cigarettes when I'm drunk, and then instead of cooking for my self a reasonable meal, I buy some fast food, which can be expensive, especially if I am drunk and getting it everyday. After a slew of drinks, I don't want to cook.

- I felt my brain was moving faster. My job felt easier, I could type faster. Other things as well, like I had more patience for problem solving.

- sober, I was a better person to be around. Family and friends told me as much, people that had no idea that I was 21 days sober, had mentioned that was just something about me that was different, in a good way.

- I had more time, to help my kids with their homework, accomplish little goals like yard work, cleaning out my garage, or other home improvement projects. Normally, being drunk, I wouldn't want to do anything. If I started drinking early enough, the day is pretty much over. I wouldn't accomplish anything. Getting stuff done made my house look great, which felt really good.

- I felt better, healthier then I have in a long time. My skin looks better too.

I'm not going to give up, if your reading this, you shouldn't either. We don't need alcohol to have fulfilling lives. I'm looking forward to all the things I will accomplish being sober. I can do this. You can too.

When troubles arise with my significant other or someone else; I read pages 416-420. 

I strive to be of service wherever I can be; at home, with my family, picking up the phone to talk with other alcoholics and actively listening to them. I volunteer at my church and I strive to be as selfless as I can be. I still have my days of uncertainty but I find that things improve when I reach out to others who have experienced similar things that I have and have ""come out the other side"".

M: Whoa. I still have this number.

R: Wow, hello. I hope you're doing well.

M: Yeah. Thanks. How're you?

R: I'm alright. Heading back to \_\_\_ in a few weeks.

M: Oh? For what?

R: To work at a clinic there, I have an old colleague that runs the practice and needs people.

M: Medic stuff?

R: I'm a Radiation Therapist now. Little better of a gig. I'm doing travel contracts now so the compensation is a little better than the army.

R: Where you at? Are things well?

M: I'm in the state of Confused.

R: Naw, you're pretty tough. Everyone is a bit confused, life isn't easy.... ever.

M: hahahaha

M: 1) You don't think I'm tough. 2) I am more confused now. Empathy? From you?

R: I've been treating cancer patients for half a decade; empathy is not a bad thing.

R: Anyway, I was thinking about you.

M: ...

R: I apologize, I had no place in reaching out. Good night.

M: I'm glad you did.

R: So I'm going back to \_\_\_ and was thinking about our time together, I just want you to know that I didn't treat you with the respect you deserve.

M: I already knew that.

R: I thought it was only fair for me to acknowledge it as well.

M: Recognizing the problem is the first step.

R: I hope things are going good for you. I'm was thinking about you and felt compelled to reach out.

R: I wanted to apologize and let you know I've reflected on our time together and understand I was not kind.

M: 5 years with cancer patients and this is the level of humility you can muster?

R: Well I'm not gonna cut my dick off and start wearing Birkenstock's.

R: I understand that you're a human and we had a unique connection that was every sexualized and full of objectivism, perhaps that's why it was so physically gratifying, but I understand that our time may have been hurtful and I wanted you to know that I understand that. And that I feel you deserve acknowledgment as a human.

M: That's a description of your experience not an acknowledgment of mine.

R: I'm willing to listen.

M: You were there.

R: Let's just say I wasn't. What was your experience?

R: Anyway, I'm not prone to apologizes. I'm horribly flawed and frequently act selfishly. I just wanted to apologize for the way I treated you.

M: I'm genuinely sorry for you that you only know how to take from others. I'm sure that has caused and is causing you a lot of pain.

M: You have that line down pat. And I know you dish it out to everyone, not just me. That was a great day when I learned that.

R: I can accept that you wish not to accept my apology. I wish you well.

M: When you learn how to give a proper apology, I would be happy to field it. But what you said earlier shows that you have learned in eight years that I have a human body that you used to gratify yourself. eight years.

M: I was sitting here wondering what I got out of all of that pain. This. This is what you taught me. Don't take shit. But I'm still me so I'm still being far more generous than you deserve.

M: You're welcome.

R: I just wanted you to know that I failed to see you as a complex human and that I understand that caused pain.

M: I used to think you were turning down our insane potential. But what I realize is you weren't strong enough to be worthy of my heart.

R: I was in no place to be a teammate with anyone.

M: I appreciate your effort. I guess I still expect more decency than you are capable of.

M: That's a far cry from brutally using a good person.

M: Pointing out that you are an ass doesn't achieve anything, certainly not a pass.

M: But I thank you for showing that you acknowledge that I would be safe enough to even come offer an apology. That means more to me.

R: I see that you're deeply hurt and an apology will not be acceptable. I can't change the situation or relationship via texted words, that is very fair. I simply wanted you to know that I respect you and I wish I had treated you better.

M: Thank you. I appreciate that.

M: I made you cookies to deal with the pain. A kindness for you to counter the hurt you gave me. Did you get them?

R: Like recently... to Texas?

R: attachment: meme of little girl burning down a house with the caption: Next time don't eat my cookies

R: Sorry sorry sorry, I have a very twisted sense of humor given all the people that I watch die.

M: You're an ESFP aren't you?

R: I think ENTP

R: No ENFO

R: ENFP

R: Naw. I'm just a regular dude who's playing the song by ear. Sometimes I play beautiful notes, sometimes I play sour notes.

M: Honey. You REALLY gotta retire that shit and evolve.

M: Doesn't it get old using the same line a thousand different ways to every person for every reason?

M: Your roommates lucked out cuz I make the best cookies ever.

R: There aren't any other persons. It's just me and my boy.

M: I don't know what you're talking about. The fact you think I sent you cookies to a place I don't know where you live eight years later is.... you and your boy must be drunk. Rob, go get your kicks elsewhere. You still don't respect me.

R: My boy is my son, he'll Be 3 in December. I'm going back to Alaska to work in a clinic that an old work friend at UTSouthWestern who is now the chief therapist. She's going to have a baby and I'm going to cover her position. She's a dear friend and a bad ass therapist so I want to help. I had been thinking about you for some time and just wanted to reach out and apologize.

M: You know, that night at the cabin, you were in bed and I went out to the bathroom and all your friends were gathered together and they invited me into the group. But you thought I wasn't good enough for you because I wouldn't fit in with them. You speak highly of every other woman while you can barely muster an acknowledgement that you are thinking of physically gratifying yourself. Is your son born of a tattooed motorcycle-riding redhead that you've dedicated your whole soul to? I am beyond sad for you that you had such amazing opportunity to experience my love and you registered only my body. If you were an ENFP, you'd have an ocean more to you.

R: Fuck you. I was wrong to apologize. Own it.

M: Ha. We finally hit the truth.

M: Apparently you forgot what our connection was. You just reminded me the last time I felt it.

R: So happy only have one pain in the ass Baby Momma.

M: I don't even know what you're talking about. But you just showed your truth.

M: Baby Momma. Dude. You were supposed to be better than that.

M: Don't bring the same old person you were eight looooong years ago to my doorstep. I've lived and grown lifetimes.

R: Yup. I did. I give empathy and kindness and everyone wants money and more more more.

R: My mistake. I just wanted to apologize and say I didn't give you a fair shake.

M: This is actually my business now. I charge $100/hr for this.

R: Send me a bill.

M: Your name is written in the annals of my life story as the person who hurt me the most. Considering \_\_\_, that's quite the accomplishment. So you have no idea what it means to me if your apology was actually genuine and you actually did respect me. You're too afraid of me. Maybe in another 8 years. I wish you all the best in \_\_\_ I really do. And you know I am wholeheartedly sincere.

M: I'll take this. I'll take what you can give. Thank you.

R: Well if you've been \_\_\_ I hardly believe I did the most damage by taking you to the shooting range and buying you dinner and rocking your body, in a positive way, we had some really good times but things didn't lineup and whatever whatever whatever. But you're just getting nasty now.

R: Sorry I didn't see you as a long time partner, I should have let you know earlier.

R: I'm apologizing for not letting you know sooner.

M: You did let me know. And proceeded to use me. Willfully. Ruthlessly. As you have been thinking of lately. And that's why you're back wanting the same. Still not seeing me any different.

R: I apologize for monopolizing our sexual relationship because physically it was next.

M: ok drunkety drunk drunk. Thank you. I appreciate the apology. Go to bed.

R: I've been focusing on my sobriety for some time now, I reached out as part of the process. I understand the lesson now.

M: Well I don't. And you just invalidated your apology. So thank you for using me yet again.

M: Our connection wasn't physical. That's why you remain emotionally closed off to me, even in an apology attempt. It won't be valid until you can be brave enough to really access what it means. But good for the trying.

R: Lets just leave you and I in 2013. I accept my flaws and failures. I accept my role. I'm not that person anymore. I want you to know I did not treat you well.

Fuck.. Halloween is a time that brings me feelings of regret, feelings of anxiety and that irrational fear of missing out on a good time. All the parties are this weekend and the temptations are knocking on my door and in my head.

“Forget it, relax.” 

“Take a sip” as Jim Morrison’s “Break on Through” plays in my fucking head.

When I got sober earlier in the year, EVERYTHING was right... but I was still damaged. 

I lost my sobriety later this year and somehow feel like it just keeps getting worst. Even after being sober.

This cycle is toxic. And sure, I’ll say I might need help but honestly I can stop right now and be alright. It’s been a week since I haven’t touched a drink..

I’ve lost so much already that it hurts.. 

I can’t keep losing

I decided it was time to resurrect myself and made the decision for myself to march back into the life i left behind with my chest pointed to the sky and found a sense of purpose. I missed being close to my family and friends. So I told my family and they kicked me out: they told me I had two options: they’ll pay for rehab *one more time* or to hit the streets. Lingering in that pink cloud I chose to go to rehab. Now I’ve been out and I am living in sober living. I’m working the steps with a sponsor, doing daily readings in the mornings, going to meetings 3-5x a week, etc.

But I sometimes feel like I am not getting anything out of it other than days building up, and for what? To build something beautiful just to one day pass? Existential crises in recovery propel a sense of exaggerated somberness. Sometimes I feel like getting a tent and the substance of whatever my heart desires is no different from living the life of complete abstinence, just because life in it of itself is just the longest distraction from impending death that we’ll ever do.

130,"Hi, 

TL;DR: After a ten year binge and a broken life, I'm sober again.

I'm new to this sub but not new to AA. I've been sober off and on for years and now I'm back. I'm back because I fucked my life up again, ended up homeless, and I'm staying at a clean and sober house to stay off of the streets. 

I ended up being homeless because my partner sold their house and decided to live in a different state. A place I didn't want to live. I went to the streets because I wasn't prepared to move out. Because I was drunk through the whole move. I ended up in a clean and sober house because something, call it God if you want, told me to unfuck my life. 

I can't remember when I started drinking again and I can't, exactly, remember how recently I stopped. Maybe last Friday. I'm thinking I might have started up again about ten years ago. I'm pretty certain it was everyday for ten years. For some reason I just can't remember all the details. 

In my first stretch of sobriety I made a principle to always be employed, never drink on the job, and keep a home. That didn't work out exactly as planned. Obviously the drinking became a problem.

I never thought I had a problem with alcohol. People drink, and work, and live their lives, and don't end up homeless. I never thought I was a ""real"" alcoholic. Those people are homeless because they love to drink more than work or live ""normal"" lives. I never thought I was one of ""them."" I fact, I still don't think I'm one of them. I know I'm wrong about that and the CD I'm experiencing is intense. I feel like I'm in shock. 

For the last six years I was in a relationship with a person who was my exact opposite in so many ways. Different religion, different politics, different views on financial matters, different views on how to live. But we were physically hot for each other and they liked to drink. But they were a ""normy."" We argued and fought a lot. And somewhere in the past three years I began to hate them. I also began to drink more and more. I knew why too. Because being nearly passed out drunk meant I didn't have to deal with how I felt about them. 

I'm a nice person. I would not say anything that would hurt a person deeply. I'd especially never say anything to a person about the mistakes they made in their past. This person had no problems with doing that. They consistently used my past against me. I could go on and on but I'll just say they were an emotional abuser. And they did it well. They hit all the traits: Manipulative, Controlling, Gaslighting, Demeaning, etc.. So along with the oppositional personality and their abuse I found good reasons to drink. I needed an escape. I even and often imagined killing myself because I couldn't find a way to escape them and ultimately escape my self. 

I've been sober for about a week. I've never craved alcohol. The cravings are strong. I don't know if I'm craving alcohol or just the escape from my feelings and troubles. Maybe the two are one and the same. I'm on my way to a meeting today. I've got some more problems to deal with but I'm just going to deal with today's problems, sober.

132,"Hello, new to this thread and AA in general. I've on and off attended meetings for a few years but never committed nor found a sponsor. I have a number of issues with AA that keep me away but the one that really got to me the most was the how it works that gets read at the beginning of each meeting. 

""Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average."" 

To me this always read as kind of culty or presumptuous from an organization that claims a 50-75% success rate and that the only alternative to AA was prison, hospitals and death. That being said I haven't actually talked to anyone in AA about this passage which I suppose is why I'm posting it here. What is your take on this section? I see it read so much but not really discussed.",alcoholicsanonymous,hello new thread aa general ive attended meeting year never committed found sponsor number issue aa keep away one really got work get read beginning meeting rarely seen person fail thoroughly followed path recover people cannot completely give simple program usually men woman constitutionally incapable honest unfortunate fault seem born way naturally incapable grasping developing manner living demand rigorous honesty chance le average always read kind culty presumptuous organization claim 5075 success rate alternative aa prison hospital death said havent actually talked anyone aa passage suppose im posting take section see read much really discussed

I share this because I tried to moderate on my own for a long time  and kept relapsing into getting drunk, usually within days or weeks. I battled with alcohol for 20 years.

The program works if you work it, the first step is the hardest. Admitting that you are powerless over alcohol and your life has become unmanageable. 

The gifts that I have received in the past 11 months are too numerous to count. I’ve submitted to my higher power and try and live life on life’s terms. Allowing life to flow through me without my toxic, habitual resistance.

135,"Hi guys, I'll try to be brief.

I'm currently working in a country where alcohol is illegal. I've been here for a couple months and have at least 3 more to go. 

 I'm used to at least have 2-4 drinks per day once I'm out of work. The first 2 weeks here were hard. My body was asking me to go have a drink. And just being in a hotel room with nothing to do didn't help.  After those 2 initial weeks, I actually felt better and didn't miss drinking that much. I actually went back home for a week and even though booze was readily available I didn't even feel like drinking. Which was great!  
I'm now back in this dry country. It's been 2 weeks now and that alcoholism feeling is coming back again. It's driving me nuts and I have tons of anxiety.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Did it go away after a while? Looks like I'm pretty alcoholic if I'm feeling this bad. Any advice?

Note: No need to mention things such as going out (there's literally nothing but desert all around me), hanging out with friends (no friends and very little people here), doing sports (I do exercise every day for about 20 mins but forget about going out in the heat). I wish I could do any of those things but it's just not possible here.",alcoholicsanonymous,hi guy ill try brief im currently working country alcohol illegal ive couple month least 3 go im used least 24 drink per day im work first 2 week hard body asking go drink hotel room nothing didnt help 2 initial week actually felt better didnt miss drinking much actually went back home week even though booze readily available didnt even feel like drinking great im back dry country 2 week alcoholism feeling coming back driving nut ton anxiety anyone situation go away look like im pretty alcoholic im feeling bad advice note need mention thing going there literally nothing desert around hanging friend friend little people sport exercise every day 20 min forget going heat wish could thing possible

Never since it began has Alcoholics Anonymous been divided by a major controversial issue.  Nor has our Fellowship ever publicly taken sides on any question in an embattled world.  This, however, has been no earned virtue.  It could almost be said that we were born with it... 'So long as we don't argue these matters privately, it's a cinch we never shall publicly.'

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 176

Do I remember that I have a right to my opinion but that others don't have to share it?  That's the spirit of 'Live and Let Live.'  The Serenity Prayer reminds me, with God's help, to 'Accept the things I cannot change.'  Am I still trying to change others?  When it comes to 'Courage to change the things I can,' do I remember that my opinions are mine, and yours are yours?  Am I still afraid to be me? When it comes to 'Wisdom to know the difference,' do I remember that my opinions come from my experience?  If I have a know-it-all attitude, aren't I being deliberately controversial?

140,"Last week my sober living house got a new resident. I told them all week, ""this guy's getting high"". He came straight from treatment. The house managers kept testing him, and he kept passing. Last Saturday, they tested him again he came up positive for methadone. They decided to let him stay and send the test out to the lab because they thought maybe the gabapentin gave him a false positive. Later that night he snuck out after curfew. I called the house manager again he came at 1:30 a.m. and tested him still just positive for methadone. They decided to put him on a 10:00 curfew indefinitely and let him stay. Before he went to sleep he came up to me and said ""I know you have 11 months and take this very seriously and I don't want you to think I'm not trying to get better..""
I told him ""you don't need to worry about what I think, if you do the right thing this will all take care of itself."" I told him and all the guys in the living room ""if I think someone's getting high I'm going to say something because I don't want to find a dead body in this house"" that was the last thing anyone said to him before he went to bed. His roommate fell asleep on the couch in the living room and didn't go upstairs until 6:30 in the morning. Around 6:30 his roommate came into my room turn the light on and told me ""I think that dude is nodded out or overdosed”. I ran upstairs as soon as I entered the room I knew it was too late. There were purple spots all over his body he laid half on the bed with his knees on the ground and his face in the pillow. I administered narcan but I knew he was gone. I felt his leg, ice cold. I called 911 and had his roommates start waking everyone up in the house so they didn't get woken up by the police. His mother showed up with his sister and girlfriend and I heard them screaming and crying. They found a needle in his arm with half a shot still in it. Also, they found urine he was passing tests with.
When they put him in the body bag they didn't even carry him. They drug the vinyl bag across the hardwood floor. The sound haunts me. The whole thing changed me it's hard not to personalize. He died on his knees.. literally brought to his knees by addiction. I can't think of a more unflattering way to go. It's a reminder of why I'm here. Life gets good and I forget sometimes.

148,"I relapsed, and found that every relapse usually involved my closest friend and I. I guess I really tried to create a sober space for us to enjoy outside of drinking because I really wanted to stay connected with her while doing the steps and going to meetings, arranged places we could visit, coffee, hiking. 

Although I found I was ignored whenever I tried to arrange said activities, and only called upon by her when she wanted to me as a drinking buddy. Of course my alcoholism would destroy me when I decide to cave in to seeing her, and damage our friendship even more so. I’d relapse and shame would consume me. 

Just recently I relapsed again with her, I decided to get honest, I let her know I was an alcoholic, and that most of our activities involved alcohol at the moment, that for me it isn’t healthy as I can’t control my intake, that it’s been a huge issue since my teen years, so for now I’d have to end our friendship until I was stable enough to meet her as to save our friendship, until we were both able to have that healthy space together we can enjoy our friendship in without it. 

Now I feel I may have made the wrong move by being honest, as though it was holier than thou, nobody needs to change anything I’m the one with an illness. Maybe I should have not said anything after the last awful relapse causing me to damage our friendship even more when Hyde came out again. Controlled myself when tempted.

Although I feel relieved to have said. I hope one day we can mend things although I understand friendships come and go at points.

How should we deal with close friends or friends in general in these situations? Is it normally best just to let things naturally dissipate, to ignore the elephant in the room, or to be honest about needing space and letting them know we’re alcoholics?

155,"I’m only day 4 sober but this isn’t new to me. I’m a “chronic relapser”. Have basically been on and off binging for 5 years now. Racked up 8 months once, otherwise it’s every 30-60 days like clockwork. I had 5 years sober before this. I have a tremendous amount of trauma and depression/anxiety issues on top of my poly substance abuse with alcohol being the number 1 issue. I need accountability and activities besides the gym (my only true outlet and current passion). 

Can I find a sponsor online or do I need to go in person? I’ve tried meetings in person before but I’m so challenged socially with AA in particular,  no one at meetings talk to me and I’ve never felt like I was a part of the group. I’ve shown up as a newcomer multiple times and have never felt welcome, seems like everyone is already friends and don’t extend a hand, which is what I’m asking for right now. I have a hard time connecting but I need that if I’m to stay sober. Often a relapse is triggered by my lack of interpersonal relationships with people who understand, and well people in general as I’m quite a loner. So when I do vent to someone they just say things like “you’re an adult, go out and have fun” which I believe, and go out and drink myself into oblivion until I can’t anymore and I’m back at square one, shaky and gripped by the “fear” brought on by withdrawal or “hangxiety”.

1. Im an alcoholic, spirits have basically possessed or obsessed me since a drop of liquor first hit my lips. Drank daily 16-24 then got sober for 4.75 years; now I’m back at day 4 at 33 yrs old
2. There is nothing but a being greater than me that can guide my will to be aligned with a greater cause and thereby action 
3. I need to turn my will over to G-d as I understand it. I used to think drinking was turning my will over to god, I’m reality it was turning my will over to my shadow in a way that can’t be integrated 
4. I’m more than willing to make an inventory of myself and 
5. share it with another alcoholic in confidence, or a whole group for that matter 
6. - 11 I’ve actually done all these steps when I was 24

Only thing is I fear becoming a groupthink member spouting idioms like “one day at a time” without actually believing them to newcomers like me who found it a deterrent . I also don’t want the big book to be my Bible. It’s a normal book and a tool, nothing more.

158,"OUR SURVIVAL

Since recovery from alcoholism is life itself to us, it is imperative that we preserve in full strength our means of survival.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 177

The honesty expressed by the members of A.A. in meetings has the power to open my mind.  Nothing can block the flow of energy that honesty carries with it.  The only obstacle to this flow of energy is inebriation, but even then, no one will find a closed door if he or she has left and chooses to return.  Once he or she has received the gift of sobriety, each A.A. member is challenged on a daily basis to accept a program of honesty.  My Higher Power created me for a purpose in life.  I ask Him to accept my honest efforts to continue on my journey in the spiritual way of life.  I call on Him for strength to know and seek His will.

159,"My name is D and I'm an alcoholic. I've barely cried. I have a few moments where I cry but overall I'm okay. I feel this incredible sense of relief and gratitude. I (30f) am just so grateful to have had this person in my life to shine a light on my alcoholism because before him I really didn't think I had a problem and if I had never meet him then I would of definitely carried on. I would of still been drinking and using and driving AND thinking it's all totally normal. 

I have a sponsor currently finishing up my step 4, so I can go over it with her, but I did very thorough steps 1,2 &amp; 3. I've made the decision to turn my will and my life over to the care of God, and I firmly believe He's got this. I am not afraid of the future and I do not regret my past because it brought me here, and here is exactly where I need to be.

160,"Hi and Goodmorning.. 

I’ve been awake since last night.. Haven’t slept due to overthinking and had no other place to go tonight but here, on this Reddit.. 

I don’t feel like the same person. I feel older, more experienced but at a cost.. the biggest loss was the future bride to be, who no longer speaks to me. 

I was in complete love, and never shared with my ex of my past alcoholism. And because of the frustration of my past, it collided with the future we were supposed to build with one another.

I plan on being a professor at a university, because it has been a lifelong dream of mine. But having her break up with me and abandon me at my most desperate time, my most vulnerable.. She left.

Ever since I lost her, I lost the will, the drive, that love.. It affected me so deeply that I missed a year of school, and since 2018 my sobriety has been hard to get in order. The love of my life moved to New York and really left me in the dust.. And my drinking just worsened..


I have a GF now but do not feel happy here with her, she makes me feel bad for being myself. I started drinking when our relationship began because honestly I am not happy here either..it’s not her fault I drink/drank, it’s just I drink to forget what a piece of shit I can be sometimes.

I miss my ex and it’s been years now. My body hurts from the alcohol abuse and im trying to be good.. 

I feel alone still, I just wanna find something with more meaning now..
I’m fighting the urge, but I need a reason to live without alcohol for comfort. I need help.",alcoholicsanonymous,hi goodmorning awake since last night slept due overthinking place go tonight reddit feel like person feel older experienced cost biggest loss future bride longer speaks complete love never shared ex past alcoholism frustration past collided future supposed build one another plan professor university lifelong dream mine break abandon desperate time vulnerable left ever since lost lost drive love affected deeply missed year school since 2018 sobriety hard get order love life moved new york really left dust drinking worsened gf feel happy make feel bad started drinking relationship began honestly happy eitherit fault drinkdrank drink forget piece shit sometimes miss ex year body hurt alcohol abuse im trying good feel alone still wanna find something meaning fighting urge need reason live without alcohol comfort need help

166,"I'm 23, almost 24 (F). I realize over and over again that I've been using pretty much every day since I was 12/13. It freaks me out in a way it doesn't freak out my peers. My mom is a serious addict. She never went all the way to IV heroin while I've been alive (that I know of) but she was a junkie like 10 years before I was born. I feel like I have her tendencies. She's certainly been consumed by her addiction, she doesn't have relationships with her children, she hasn't had a long-term partner really since she and my dad broke up, she got evicted because of either just not paying or some drug-related offense I bet, and she was homeless when she was on heroin. She'll be 60 in a few months and is headed toward dying in squalor alone of her addictions and their consequences. I'm sad for her. I watched her get to this point and I understand how she just slowly crept there. I too use drugs just enough to keep afloat and not destroy everything all at once. I have jumped from addiction to addiction, some more destructive than others. I've stopped cold turkey on the bad ones at times but always held on to more ""manageable"" things.  

I've certainly damaged relationships and myself and almost died even. And that was enough to make me pull it back or stop for a time. But I've never been able to fully pull myself out. I've never truly committed. I've gone to therapy and rehab and found god and fallen in love and traveled and gone back to school. I've markedly made my life better and ""changed"" and gone after things that fulfill me and make me happy. I have long-term friendships. I worked on my relationship with my dad and distanced myself from my sister and mother who were abusive. I've gone to rehab a few times. I've honestly tried and moved forward. I subsisted for a few years on kratom daily and my life was good. I want, in theory, to be sober and healthy. I feel a lot of shame around all of this. I just moved to NYC a month ago and I've done coke two times by myself and multiple times with others and blacked out a few times. Both of which I haven't done in a while and def not consistently in years. Nothing terrible happened yet, I can feel it coming though, partying is so accessible here. Way more than where I was when I first started all of that. Why can't I break through? How bad of a bottom would I have to hit? I don't ever really let it go that far and even then, I can see how I'm just stealing potential and time and happiness from myself. At least I haven't yet, recently. But I know where it's headed and I can't let myself ruin everything I've built.  

Sorry this is so long, stimulants do that. 

TLDR: Please help me to help myself! How do I truly commit to sobriety and stop my addictions for good? How did you do it and why did you? I am young and don't want to waste my life. I have goals and interests!!",alcoholicsanonymous,im 23 almost 24 f realize ive using pretty much every day since 1213 freak way doesnt freak peer mom serious addict never went way iv heroin ive alive know junkie like 10 year born feel like tendency shes certainly consumed addiction doesnt relationship child hasnt longterm partner really since dad broke got evicted either paying drugrelated offense bet homeless heroin shell 60 month headed toward dying squalor alone addiction consequence im sad watched get point understand slowly crept use drug enough keep afloat destroy everything jumped addiction addiction destructive others ive stopped cold turkey bad one time always held manageable thing ive certainly damaged relationship almost died even enough make pull back stop time ive never able fully pull ive never truly committed ive gone therapy rehab found god fallen love traveled gone back school ive markedly made life better changed gone thing fulfill make happy longterm friendship worked relationship dad distanced sister mother abusive ive gone rehab time ive honestly tried moved forward subsisted year kratom daily life good want theory sober healthy feel lot shame around moved nyc month ago ive done coke two time multiple time others blacked time havent done def consistently year nothing terrible happened yet feel coming though partying accessible way first started cant break bad bottom would hit dont ever really let go far even see im stealing potential time happiness least havent yet recently know headed cant let ruin everything ive built sorry long stimulant tldr please help help truly commit sobriety stop addiction good young dont want waste life goal interest

175,"I’m approaching my 1-year sober milestone. I’ve largely stayed far away from dating, I live near NYC and going out for a drink is most people’s idea of a good icebreaker. That and I just wasn’t ready to even hookup or casually get to know anyone.

Last month I met someone off a dating app and I’m quite smitten. Things are moving fairly quickly and we’re both interested in a relationship, but I’ve been firm with my boundaries regarding no relationships until I pass my year milestone, as well as certain boundaries surrounding drug and alcohol use. 

For those who mostly dated drunk and had to navigate dating and relationships in sobriety: how did it feel for you? Personally, I’m terrified most of the time because I can’t A) use alcohol as “liquid courage” anymore, or b) get drunk to serve as a buffer against things that make me uncomfortable. I am experiencing all my fears and insecurities around close relationships with other people in real time, no checking out. As bad as I make it sound I’m also pleasantly surprised I could feel anything for someone as it is, when I used to drink it would make me feel more affectionate and amicable to others and I was worried those feelings would be inaccessible in sobriety.

176,"AN UNBROKEN TRADITION

We conceive the survival and spread of Alcoholics Anonymous to be something of far greater importance than the weight we could collectively throw back of any other cause.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 177

How much it means to me that an unbroken tradition of more than half a century is a thread that connects me to Bill W. and Dr. Bob.  How much more grounded I feel to be in a Fellowship whose aims are constant and unflagging.  I am grateful that the energies of A.A. have never been scattered, but focused instead on our members and on individual sobriety.  My beliefs are what make me human; I am free to hold any opinion, but A.A.'s purpose - so clearly stated fifty years ago - is for me to keep sober.  That purpose has promoted round-the-clock meeting schedules, and the thousands of inter-group and central service offices, with their thousands of volunteers.  Like the sun focused through a magnifying glass, A.A.'s single vision has lit a fire of faith in sobriety in millions of hearts, including mine.

177,"My sobriety date is 6/14/2020. Prior to this, I had years of un-treated alcoholism in the form of not drinking and also not working the 12 steps. I went to meetings and talked the talk, but I looked for an easier softer method and after 7 years I contemplated suicide.

What I discovered is that I have a spiritual malady that requires a spiritual solution. I practice the 12 steps in all of my affairs, attend meetings, work with a sponsor and pray/meditate. But one of the most useful tools that I use daily is to seek and read literature as I have always had a fondness for the written word. I wanted to share a list of books that I have found useful in my recovery. If you have suggestions, please feel free to add via the comments. I love you all.

The only thing that matters is that he is an alcoholic who has found a key to sobriety.  These legacies of suffering and of recovery are easily passed among alcoholics, one to the other.  This is our gift from God, and its bestowal upon others like us is the one aim that today animates A.A.'s all around the globe.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 151

The strength of Alcoholics Anonymous lies in the desire of each member and of each group around the world to share with other alcoholics their suffering and the steps taken to gain, and maintain, recovery.  By keeping a conscious contact with my Higher Power, I make sure that I always nurture my desire to help other alcoholics, thus insuring the continuity of the wonderful fraternity of Alcoholics Anonymous.

203,"         I’m a 28 year old male, my sponsor has me on step ten as of last night. I’ve been in a rocky relationship with my girlfriend who isn’t in the program and isn’t “one of us”. We’ve been together about eight months, however I’ve been very unhappy with our relationship and have tried breaking up with her at least 6 times so far. It never goes well. 
           She has tried to leave me stranded in an unfamiliar town up in the mountains of Nederland, Colorado which is hours away from where my family lives, somewhere I had never been to before,after a disagreement and argument. I’ve also witnessed some personality changes in her and when she gets angry I am frightened of and for her. Further complicating matters, she has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and has survived cancer before years ago. She also was a victim of child sexual abuse when she was a minor (she is now 37). Her family are dysfunctional too.

205,"I've been a social drinker since I was of age, and slowly but steadily have gotten more intertwined with alcohol in recent years.

It started becoming more of a thing when my grandmother died 5 years ago, and ramped up a bit more when I started living alone a couple of years later, and then again during Covid.

I know that I drink more that most (maybe all?) people I know, but up until lately I've dismissed this because I haven't really let it affect my work or social lives. A couple of weeks ago, while drunk, I looked up AA meetings near me for the first time ever. I came up with excuses to talk myself out of actually going at that time. 

I've been thinking about it again the last couple of days. I think my biggest hurdle right now is that I'm almost 100% sure that even if I go to a meeting I will mess it up and fall back into drinking fairly quickly, and I hate to fail...

213,"Not sure who else to talk to so here goes:

My wife and I are looking at having kids in the next 6 months or so, but I’m really concerned about her relationship with alcohol. I’ve “walked in on” her in the kitchen a few times, just super drunk out of nowhere. Like, glassy eyes, swaying for balance, can’t get coherent words out drunk. Which in itself is annoying, but not a total deal breaker since there’s a lot about her that I love really deeply. But still, I find her unattractive when she’s in that state. 

What worries me is when I’ll ask her about it, she’ll say she didn’t drink anything. Also, I never actually see her drink, so I’m pretty sure she’s hiding it. Which isn’t a good sign. 

Still, the evidence is there. All the once-full bottles in the liquor cabinet are empty, and I haven’t been drinking anything over the last few months. Plus, there are some half empty fifths in the garage that I don’t remember getting. So clearly someone in the house is drinking, and it’s not me. Just the two of us live here. 

So I think she’s drinking in secret, and drinking a lot at times. Still, it’s not a daily occurrence. 

Where I worry is that she totally denies this, and denies the idea that she might have a problem drinking (I’ve learned not to bring this up), and she is totally confident she won’t drink during pregnancy or with small children around. But I’ve learned I can’t believe anything she says or promises about her drinking. So I don’t know what to do here. 

Basically, I’m worried I’ll end up watching my wife hurt herself and our future child with her drinking, but at that point it will be too late to avoid this scenario. I don’t know how to discuss it with her. Since we’re both 30 I feel like there’s a little bit of a ticking clock here in terms of addressing her drinking and starting a family. But ultimately, I would rather have kids safely without her than with her if she doesn’t/won’t acknowledge this issue. 

She has a lot of trauma from her mom’s drinking when she was a kid (dad’s a recovering alcoholic too but hasn’t drank in 28 years). She HATES the idea of therapy and says, “that’s not how I process things.” But she gets weirdly emotional when talking about family stuff so I feel like she hasn’t so much “processed” as “repressed” these issues. I think she has some self-worth/self-love issues around this, that aren’t getting better with age. 

As I understand it, direct confrontation isn’t the way to deal with alcoholism because the sense of shame just leads to more drinking. So really any advice on any of this would be good.

Watching as they had trouble coming to terms with confronting their issues because the alcohol was always their solution instead of facing it head on. They grew so much and started finding stability. Fought me tooth and nail about going to meetings and after they got so far they always ended up sabotaging themselves. It was fight after fight over the Golden rule and their understanding of it was very self serving. It always came down to some from of slavery because issue came if I had any kind of freedom and if they did itlit was not supposed to be a problem. Contact fights of making it be know that if they didn't like the way I was return the treatment given to me then it wasn't okay in the first place and shouldn't have been done to me. Things would get better then fall apart in a repetitive cycle. Some fights were bad with shoves and yelling but this last one they got violent and then intentionally broke a window. Came back from a friend's birthday party to see they relapsed and were so depressed. Thought I would hate them but I didn't. I simply wanted them out of the car inside safe and sound so we could resolve this issue with a clear mind after rest.it didn't go that way and I had to throw them out. I can't get the feeling off of me that I hurt them even though I was hurt by them, but when they came back to get their belongings it was like talking to a lost child not sure why they did what they did and on the verge of begging for forgiveness. I don't feel I should give in because if I do again they will never understand that their actions have consequences because giving them a get out of jail for free card allows them to believe they can get away with it here and there..... I guess I just wish everything was different that that alcohol never caused them or anyone this sort of chaos and lack of control.

230,That is all.,alcoholicsanonymous,
231,"WARNING: This post contains harsh criticism of Abrahamic/Monotheistic Belief Systems.

Hello, I (23M) am an addict. I went to my first 12 step- program today and am very glad I did. It was an AA meeting at the university I am currently attending, and although I am not an alcoholic the leader of the program said it was okay if I attended the meetings. (I abuse marijuana and wax concentrate)

I am planning on reaching out to the leader of the meeting and asking him to help me with making a commitment to my sobriety. After the meeting he told me that the best thing I can do for sobriety is ask God to help me. The problem is that I do not necessarily believe in God. 

They told me that all religions can do AA and the 12 step program, even an atheist. The problem is I am not an atheist. I believe it is very possible God is real. I just have no interest in God or prayer... Even if I were to consciously admit that God is real I genuinely do not have anything to say to him. 

The way I see it putting my faith in God is pointless and naive. It doesn't matter if God is real because he isn't here now and he isn't going to protect me from anything. I know this because I have seen life at the bottom.. not personally but I have read and seen so many horrific things at this point that I refuse to believe God has a plan for us. There are so many people who don't really get to live out that narrative: people born with terrible malformations and diseases, little girls kidnapped and kept as sex slaves, Saudi warchild born to drug addicted homeless parents, etc.. Some people are born with zero hope or chance for anything but misery or suffering. The idea that nothing is hopeless and that there is some great plan is nothing but a complete lie. Humanity has conjured mythology to cope with and live in denial in face of the unbearable and awful reality actually is sometimes. Some people don't get chances, and there is no amount of prayer that will bring them salvation.

I think that the belief in God is one of humanities greatest mistakes. As long as we believe God will solve our problems then there is no motivation for us to become desperate to save ourselves from REAL tragedy horror, not some theoretical afterlife. 

That being said, my greater power is community. I am stupid, naive, hopeless, and ignorant- and so is mostly everybody else. However the community of my people is immeasurably greater in value and smarter than myself. When I am lost, arrogant, and useless, I can count on the community of my people that has upheld for thousands of generations and contains wisdom and elders I can seek guidance from. To me that is real, authentic, and effective. I do not think I will ever start praying until I am on my deathbed or in a foxhole, and even though I admit that would probably happen in such case I feel as if praying now would be lying to myself and I cannot honestly admit to the group or my mentor that I have sought out God because I rejected God already and have chosen a different higher power as the object of my 12 step program.

I guess I am just trying to figure out how I can get all of this across to a guy that thinks God is responsible for literally every event in the universe?... Without just telling him I think he is absurd and wrong?

TLDR;

I want to do the 12 step program but I refuse to integrate 'God' into my belief system.

How do you break up with an alcoholic who doesn't want help and doesn't want to stop? How do you do it in a kind, loving and tolerant way? How do I explain my sobriety comes first? How do you say my goals and desires are different? 

A little background: 5 year relationship, we partied together he (34M) works and pays most of the rent but he drinks and doesn't want help. He has 3 DUIs. He is verbally abusive and it gets a lot worse when he drinks (it can get physical sometimes too). I'm (30f) no angel... like I'm an alcoholic too, but I've been participating in AA. I have a sponsor and I've been trying to change my life (currently on step 4).

Day 2: I am at the meeting location at the specific time. 15 minutes later, he still has not arrived. I text him to ask if he is still free to meet. He responds that he forgot and is not feeling well and that he will check in with me the next day.

Day 3: I call him in the afternoon. The phone rings and goes to voicemail. (I did not leave a voicemail or send a text and in hindsight, I should have.)

Day 4: I text him to ask if there is good time for us to check in. He responds that he will text me that afternoon. I did not receive any follow up text or call.

It is now day 5. I am annoyed and trying to not feel resentful. I am hesitant to text or call again, because I am afraid that I will say something I will regret. Last night, I felt angry but called some fellow AAs, meditated, and calmed down.

I like my sponsor a lot, and this is out of character. It is possible that there is more I don't know -- maybe there was a family emergency, or something else urgent. I just don't have information and would like to continue moving forward with step-work.

My pride is telling me that now it is on him to reach out to me; but I don't feel this is a healthy response.

243,"I ""quit"" 44 days ago, with the intention of quitting forever.

Now, I can't say I was an alcoholic, and my drinking habits were in the healthy range.

But my liver started hurting after a day of drinking (I don't exceed 3 drinks per day and each drink is 12 fl oz of beer, also, I have a 7-day in-between rule)  So I said that enough is enough. I'm going to stop forever starting with a 90 to really destroy the habit. 

But now doubts are creeping in my mind: ""Hey ... what if I drank right now, and completed the 90-day challenge with me cheating only once. After the 90 day challenge, I promise I'll drink just once a month.""

Maybe I haven't felt enough pain ... but I feel like it's not so bad if I only drink once a month.

Now, if you ever quit alcohol, don't ever come back. This isn't me trying to suggest anything. I had a pretty bad happening with alcohol a few years ago, but aside from that, I've just drunk with moderation.

This is just me asking your opinion on my approach. I know I have sufficient willpower to pull the 30-day rule, but I'm not sure. I was so happy at the thought that I will never drink again, but I don't think that thought is realistic for me.

Again, if you did quit, don't listen to a word I say.

245,"Everyone at AA is very gung ho about fellowship, always saying everyone should always come. When I was new, on my very second day of sobriety, a particular group at a particular meeting was going out to eat for fellowship afterward. I had raised my hand for a sponsor and a few remembered I had gotten my 24 hour chip at another meeting the day before, so lots of them stopped to talk to me afterwards and told me I should definitely go. It was very friendly and kind and I was willing to do anything in the beginning so I went.

Being there was a different story. A few talked to me for a moment at the beginning, but that conversation quickly fizzled out and everyone naturally segregated into their own smaller groups of their pre-existing friends. I tried chiming in a few more times but struggled to actually get into a conversation of any length. This one bit** right next to me said ONE WORD every time I talked to her until I gave up. Hate her til this day. They all just talked about people/ things that they knew and I didn’t. I tried my best to stay open and calm (as opposed to socially anxious) and I did not take out my phone. Overall, I did not like this experience. 

I don’t claim to be some amazing conversationalist, so I’m not saying it’s even all their fault. But I felt stupid for agreeing to go to fellowship when no one really wanted to talk to me, even when I was a raw 48 hours sober. And forget about now that I’m 2 months and not new anymore. I WOULD absolutely go to fellowship with my home group, or if a friend I knew was already there. But the whole “definitely go!!!” thing is bullshit.

Without unity I would be unable to recover in A.A. on a daily basis.  By practicing unity within my group, with other A.A. members and at all levels of this great Fellowship, I receive a pronounced feeling of knowing that I am a part of a miracle that was divinely inspired.  The ability of Bill W. and Dr. Bob, working together and passing it on to other members, tells me that to give it away is to keep it.  Unity is oneness and yet the whole Fellowship is for all of us.

258,"Sooo, I’m almost 24 now, I’ve been drinking extremely heavily ( anywhere from 6-18 beers a night every night for 2 years now) while I was drinking approx a year into it I started having pain in my right side near the rib cage area, slight shakes, gross floating stools always diarrhea that were commonly if not always pale in color, still ate well; still do. I went to the doctor and they told me my levels were really high for my liver, I was able to stabilize those levels by cutting down, really paying attention for about a month. Eating smoothies daily, eating beats and beat supplement, taking milk thistle you name it . But of course I fell back into old habits. about 6 months ago my blood pressure was regularly about 160/110 which I knew was related and caused me to be very hazy, irritable and no ability to relax at any point. I am on meds now which help a lot with that I am above normal for what it used to be because of the meds . More recently I’ve had a real big wake up call within myself ( my two kids being my motivation ) and started drinking maybe 3-4 beers a night significantly cutting down with a end goal of 14-16 beers a week at max spaced out every other night. My overall health feels much better, I have more energy, increased appetite, no pain in my right side if I do it’s not noticeable, maybe less energy than usual but still a significant increase . But my stool is still considerably pale but no diarrhea. My end question here is with this drinking habit and current conditions mentioned above how fucked is my liver ?

262,"Hello, I'm not an alcoholic but I recently baked a few pies using a pie crust recipe which includes vodka, and later realized that one of my dinner guests (who I don't know very well personally) is a recovered alcoholic whose been sober for a few years now.

It's way too late to make a separate dessert at this point, should I just inform the person privately and let them make their own decision? Maybe I can text his gf and ask what desserts he likes, and go out and buy something else? 

Is it okay to eat foods cooked with alcohol if the flavor of the dish is not affected at all? From my research, it seems that in a blind baked crust like this, there would only be 1/4 tsp alcohol left in the entire pie at the end of the process, at most.

I smoked absurd amounts...., I sold it to other students and spent all of my paycheck and the money my doctor mother gave me to smoke drugs over the past 8 years. 

The town I am in is small suburban midwestern with mostly wealthy community. I am not sure what the crowd will be like but I am very very scared and I do not want to go. I feel like it is something that I must do because I have literally tried to quit consuming cannabis and cannabis products over 100 times within the past 5 years or so. I was sober three or less months for three occasions for reasons outside of my control, then I relapsed.

However I feel like there is a chance I will not fit in... I am very young and I expect many of them to just be so much different from the type of person that I am.

Has anyone heard of an individual being obsessed with drinking - everything to do with it (the fact that you’re a drinker, the fun of learning about different glassware/other accessories, drinking the alcohol, disliking the thought of you not being a drinker, etc) but ultimately every time the person drinks, no matter how much (probably has Alcohol Intolerance) they get sick, whether it’s just nausea or full blown throwing up. This has been occurring for about 15 years. The person can stop consuming alcohol for long periods but still has the obsessions about it. Most recent step away from alcohol was for a little over a year. They did not try to sneak alcohol or drink in secret. But I’m assuming when the obsession of it got too strong asked if it was ok if they gave drinking another go (I just learned about this truth so I said ok because I didn’t really think they had a problem). This was all admitted to me a few days ago. So despite it making him sick (at low quantities and high) he would still continue to drink and if didn’t throw up naturally, he will make himself throw it up.

He went to two AA meetings and switched to non alcoholic beer but yesterday he came home and told me he ended up having a shot and a beer after work. I already resent this bar so much because of the decisions he’s made while there but I’m trying not to be so harsh.

292,"I’ll start by saying everyone I’ve ever met in AA has been very kind. 

Unfortunately, however, I’m struggling to find a sponsor who’ll just go through the steps with me as they appear in the book. I understand the importance of meetings and I’m not particularly averse to them. I am averse to the quantity that’s being pushed onto me. I’m shy, I find them draining, and I know in my heart that 90 in 90 would wear me down to the point that I’d be in real danger of drinking. It has happened before. I can tell when I’ve been to too many meetings because I get thrown off kilter and my mental state goes west.

The thing is, I don’t know where to meet a potential sponsor but at a meeting. And everyone I encounter seems to be of the “meeting makers make it” school, which just isn’t true and definitely isn’t appropriate for me. I’ve read the book, and nowhere in it does it say anything about inhaling meetings.

I’m ready to turn this shit over to God. I want to do the steps. I strongly believe in the idea of one alcoholic talking to another, but everyone I talk to keeps pushing this over complicated narrative that’s not part of the program and it’s honestly just confusing the hell out of me.

I know I don’t have to take these suggestions about going to meetings, but I think I’d find it difficult to work with a sponsor whose only solution to any given problem is to go to an absurd number of meetings and call an absurd number of people who will give the same advice.

Just to be clear, I’m not going to stop going to meetings. Meetings are good, and I’m not opposed to meetings as a suggestion, just the suggestion of literally hundreds as a magical cure-all. Also, power to those for whom 90 in 90 works. I’m just not interested in it.

I’m sorry that this was very long winded, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have to offer on how to find a sponsor who’d appreciate this, or even just how to sensitively lay down to a meeting pusher that I want to do it how the book says without the additional stuff that I don’t find necessary or helpful.",alcoholicsanonymous,start saying everyone ever met aa kind unfortunately however struggling find sponsor go step appear book understand importance meeting particularly averse averse quantity pushed onto shy find draining know heart 90 90 would wear point real danger drinking happened tell many meeting get thrown kilter mental state go west thing know meet potential sponsor meeting everyone encounter seems meeting maker make school true definitely appropriate read book nowhere say anything inhaling meeting ready turn shit god want step strongly believe idea one alcoholic talking another everyone talk keep pushing complicated narrative part program honestly confusing hell know take suggestion going meeting think find difficult work sponsor whose solution given problem go absurd number meeting call absurd number people give advice clear going stop going meeting meeting good opposed meeting suggestion suggestion literally hundred magical cureall also power 90 90 work interested sorry long winded would appreciate suggestion offer find sponsor appreciate even sensitively lay meeting pusher want book say without additional stuff find necessary helpful

I've been working the first step and it has been quite the experience. For the first time in years, I sat down and wrote a list of how much chaos and destruction alcohol has caused in my life. Many emotions that have been covered with alcohol are resurfacing and I'm learning to deal with these emotions the best way I can. 

I knew I had a problem for years. I would sometimes joke about it to cover up how I truly was feeling. When people would talk to me about their concerns, I would yell at them. That was until someone finally convinced me to go. I didn't yell, I didn't cuss her out, I simply said ""OK"" and I picked a date to go. Same person sent me a text the night before the selected date to remind me to go. 

Even though I was aware I had a problem, I didn't realize how much the bottle had me in its grasp till I started going to meetings and wrote down that list. It's been a rough but healing week.

'Shoemaker, stick to thy last!'... better do one thing supremely well than many badly.  That is the central theme of this Tradition [Five].  Around it our Society gathers in unity.  The very life of our Fellowship requires the preservation of this principle.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 150

The survival of A.A. depends upon unity.  What would happen if a group decided to become an employment agency, a treatment center or a social service agency?  Too much specialization leads to no specialization, to frittering of efforts and, finally, to decline.  I have the qualifications to share my sufferings and my way of recovery with the newcomer.  Conformity to A.A.'s primary purpose ensures the safety of the wonderful gift of sobriety, so my responsibility is enormous.  The life of millions of alcoholics is closely tied to my competence in 'carrying the message to the still-suffering alcoholic.'

303,"I have been through, in my opinion, minor things. Cheated on but feel like I'm forced to stay even though I still love her. Made to feel like I was going crazy when it was all happening. I'd point something out we'd talk about it. That would turn into a majer argument and it would end with me being the ahole. Feel like I'm forced because she says if I leave she's going to kill her self. Now she says that if I leave then she won't leave the house. That she has to stay for the kids and accuses me of not loving them because I want to break up the family. I really can't talk to anyone because she got on me about talking to friends and family about my issue when I found out she was cheating. I was basically trying to get help from close ones but she made me feel bad because they shouldn't know our personal business. Also when I've talked to her she has come back and said I complain to much, I'm only trying to make people feel bad for me and that I'm just having a pity party. So now I kinda refuse to talk to anyone about anything. 

Manipulated by my mom now that I look back at my childhood. Well I think it's manipulation, she said she would kill herself if I ever acted like my brother and dad. Witch mainly ment if I was mean to her since that's how she said they would treat her. 

May or may not have been touched as a child. I feel like it's just a nightmare now when I think about it. I'm confused if it actually ever really happened. 

I have never really drank as much as I do now. Did drugs, smoked weed and drank at a young age but it's never got this bad till after the pandemic. 

I know, well think, those could be some causes but feel like people have gone through worse and never went this route. My mental state isn't really all that good but for the reasons listed above I don't really have the will power to talk to anyone. Now that I'm writing this I'm kinda scared my wife will look through my phone and see the post. Then make me feel like an ahole because I told reddit this then go on about how she ruined my life. That's what usually happens. I kinda see it as manipulation but when I brought that up to her, of course, she made me feel bad. I can't remember how because, of course,  i was drunk. Even though I was drunk, i do remember the feeling of it being my fault. This is kind of a rant at this point but it feels good to get it off my chest.

 For anyone who's wondering, I drink 4-6 drinks a day. Witch are 8% alcohol because I can get a buzz faster.

Again, for anyone who's wondering,  the cheating happened about 6 years ago. Since then though, she texted my best friend about things that shouldn't have been talked about between my bf and wife. She proceeded to lie about it till I got some of the truth from him. That happened 3 years after she cheated. Then recently she texted a friend of mine that I told her I didn't want her texting privately. I had accuses to her messanger and would go and read there convos. Fucked up yeah I know. Anyway, I asked her not to privately text him. Just so happen to find out they were texting and yeah it wasn't just friend talk either. That's about the 6 year mark witch happenedabout 2 months ago. So kinda seems like a trend.

315,So my boyfriend is an alcoholic and has not had a drink in the past month! I’m very happy for him but would like some advice. I stupidly didn’t do much research on alcoholism so I wasn’t much help to him which makes me feel terrible. For example when he acknowledged the problem and cut back he would still have a few beers a night. I did not stop him cause I didn’t want him to have withdrawals and he does say he can control how much he drinks. Now that he has stopped the past month I was wondering what to do if he try’s and have a drink? Every where I’ve looked pretty much says an alcoholic cannot control themselves and I believe this to be true with him. He always asks me first if he can drink which makes me feel bad cause I do not want to control him but don’t want to encourage it. Like I said he isn’t currently drinking which I amazing but I want to be prepared for the future if something does occur and I want to be able to help any way possible. Any advice on what to say If he asks to drink would be appreciated.,alcoholicsanonymous,boyfriend alcoholic drink past month happy would like advice stupidly much research alcoholism much help make feel terrible example acknowledged problem cut back would still beer night stop cause want withdrawal say control much drink stopped past month wondering try drink every looked pretty much say alcoholic cannot control believe true always asks first drink make feel bad cause want control want encourage like said currently drinking amazing want prepared future something occur want able help way possible advice say asks drink would appreciated

Finally, we begin to see that all people, including ourselves, are to some extent emotionally ill as well as frequently wrong, and then we approach true tolerance and see what real love for our fellows actually means.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 92

The thought occurred to me that all people are emotionally ill to some extent.  How could we not be?  Who among us is spiritually perfect?  Who among us is physically perfect?  How could any of us be emotionally perfect?  Therefore, what else are we to do but bear with one another and treat each other as we would be treated in similar circumstances?  That is what love really is.

But might I just be an impulsive depressed person with poor self-control, bad habits generally (watching too much tv, taking comfort in bad relationships, sleeping too much, generally liking to “escape”)?

I think if I were happier, I wouldn’t feel the need to drink. Maybe if I were on some good anti-depressants, I wouldn’t feel the need to drink. I have some kind of panic disorder, and I have panic attacks regularly— drinking helps temper my episodes. 

It’s possible that the “why” I drink doesn’t matter so much. I’m drinking too much and it’s interfering with my relationships, my success at work, and probably my physical health.

I guess I just find the fatalism of “you are an alcoholic, you can never drink” to be discouraging. If I got some other stuff organized in my life, maybe I could drink, and it wouldn’t be this whole “you drank, you are a failure, you are powerless” thing.

334,"Recently I was told by a member of the program I trust that was Malipulative. The exact quote was ""wow, your malipulative"". And its got me doing some deep reflecting on it, and I am not sure the word she used fits correctly.  So I am looking for added perspective to fully recongize this defect of character and work on it.   


Here is the full story.   


On Monday, I had planned to head up to clean the club( prior to the meeting) that we have AA meetings at. I post on Facebook when I do so, so those who wish to stop in can and that there is someone there if they should need them. (I care little about my Anonymity ) One member of the fellowship called me and asked if I could pick him up and he would help me clean. Now this was a voicemail and I at first was only going to pick him up because it was the right thing to do, not that I wanted to. Then I realized that if I picked him up, he would get tired after a few minutes of cleaning make an excuse, then leave and then he wouldn't attend the meeting. So then I became happy to pick him up and did so.   


Now, I pick him and he immediate remembers some errand he needs to run and I drop him off at the errand and he says he will meet me at the club when he is done to help. I get to the club and I clean. He gets there right when I have two things left to do, vacuum and santizing chairs. I ask him to vacuum since I wanted to make sure the chairs were santized correctly. He vacuums for a few minutes breaks the vaccum, then starts another cleaning activity. Then after the cleaning activity which was only a few minutes, he states he needs to go and I run him home. 

I get back and the 1st person for the meeting his arrived while I was gone. I tell her the rundown of what started as me explaining where I was(It was still pre meeting, but during the given time for fellowship) but turn a little into a venting session. Me, explaining running this person to the errand, then him breaking the vaccum, and making the excuse to leave. Then me saying how I knew he was going to do that when I picked him up. 

After that I got the response that I am malipulative. Which of course I was defensive about at first, but a little confused, since I did nothing to change the outcome I am not sure if Malipulative fits. I certainly have an defect here as I should never me happy that someone isn't attending a meeting I am chairing.  I have at least identified why I didn't want this person at the meeting. This person has mental illness that makes it hard for him understand inappropiate behavior and there is some boundry issues with him and women.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 10

With the self-discipline and insight gained from practicing Step Ten, I begin to know the gratifications of sobriety - not as mere abstinence from alcohol, but as recovery in every department of my life.  I renew hope, regenerate faith, and regain the dignity of self-respect.  I discover the word 'and' in the phrase 'and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.'  Reassured that I am no longer always wrong, I learn to accept myself as I am, with a new sense of the miracles of sobriety and serenity.

Obviously, the dilemma of the wanderer from faith is that of profound confusion.  He thinks himself lost to the comfort of any conviction at all.  He cannot attain in even a small degree the assurance of the believer, the agnostic, or the atheist.  He is the bewildered one.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 28

The concept of God was one that I struggled with during my early years of sobriety.  The images that came to me, conjured from my past, were heavy with fear, rejection and condemnation.  Then I heard my friend Ed's image of a Higher Power: As a boy he had been allowed a litter of puppies, provided that he assume responsibility for their care.  Each morning he would find the unavoidable 'byproducts' of the puppies on the kitchen floor.  Despite frustration, Ed said he couldn't get angry because 'that's the nature of puppies.'  Ed felt that God viewed our defects and shortcomings with a similar understanding and warmth.  I've often found solace from my personal confusion in Ed's calming concept of God.

I’m 25 years old and so much of the “fun” and “exciting” times in my life have gone hand in hand with alcohol and substances. I don’t know how to live an exciting and fulfilling life without them. 

I know that I’ll be healthier and generally happier (by means of elimination: I’ll be less hungover, less anxious, etc.) But I am so scared I’ll be boring. Thinking about all the things I expect sober people to do (go hiking, read books, etc.) just sound boring to me. 

I love underground raves, parties, events, garage shows, concerts, etc. But I know I can’t go to any of these things that I’ve revolved my life around for a long time because they’ll trigger me. This is why I almost always tend to relapse on weekends and struggle to get past 20 days. 

Does anyone have advice for FOMO hindering their recovery?",alcoholicsanonymous,lot inner exploration holding back recovery alcohol substance journey realized really come fomo fear missing 25 year old much fun exciting time life gone hand hand alcohol substance know live exciting fulfilling life without know healthier generally happier mean elimination le hungover le anxious etc scared boring thinking thing expect sober people go hiking read book etc sound boring love underground raf party event garage show concert etc know go thing revolved life around long time trigger almost always tend relapse weekend struggle get past 20 day anyone advice fomo hindering recovery

My home group is a bit different than others.  We're very relaxed but we need someone to have 3 months to chair a meeting and I had 3 months on the 18th.

Almost everyone was running late tonight including our secretary/kh but we still managed to get started on time.  I'm not going to lie and say that I was relaxed because I absolutely wasn't.  I helped to get set up in a rush while everyone was following us in and I was terrified that I was going to let down a group of people who have done so much for me.

I took my seat and got to have my sponsor on my right and my best friend on my left.  Tonight was my first home group meeting after passing that 3 month mark so instead of giving myself a chip, my best friend did the chips tonight and she was excited that she got to be the one to give me that chip.

We had newcomers tonight and I was incredibly nervous about giving them a really good, first time experience.  In the parking lot meeting after, I got to hear that they felt really welcomed.

I don't really know why I'm posting this.  Maybe it's just a sense of gratitude for everything that my home group and AA have given me, maybe it's for the first time chairs that are worried.

352,"READ THE AA LITERATURE, DON'T TAKE ADVICE FROM STRANGERS ONLINE OR IN THE ROOMS OF AA UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHO IS AN ALCOHOLIC AND WHO IS THERE FOR OTHER REASONS. AA is full of religious (not spiritual) zealots who want to ""take control of your life"".  The only thing a sponsor is for is going through the steps.  AA literature suggests strongly that sponsors let sponsees go back to the groups (ie: leave them alone after working the steps).

As a side note for new people, be very careful in AA.  Todays AA meetings are mostly street drug users.  ""Cousins to alcoholics"" as our literature states, but ""we should not be telling them they are members of AA"".  Criminal behavior comes with the street drug life, it takes a hell of a lot to get off most drugs than it does booze, so the bigshot AA'ers telling drug addicts their in the right place are killing addicts and killing AA.

Pick your meetings, vet your friends in AA.  Our groups in the last 5 years have had everything from ""members"" robbing members, a bunch of sexual assaults on new women, one shooting in the parking lot (dead) and assorted felonies and misdemeanors.

To all you spiritual people who will trash my comments, you would know about this stuff because the AA Grapevine (official magazine of AA) is finally printing stories about this problem, but there were less than 5,000 subscriptions to the Grapevine back in 2015, so most people will never see these.

Anyone tries to take over your life in AA, or pressure you into anything, tell them to take a hike.  AA published a yellow card for meetings in 2019, on criminal behavior, but most groups won't read it, it hits too close to home.  The reason for the warning card is AA New York has been named in a bunch of lawsuits mostly by women assaulted by other members.  This is not a new story, it goes back to Mr Wilson example in sobriety.

There a a lot of alternative today too, there may be a ""last house on the block"", but AA isn't it. Working on fourth decade, I've seen it all, and you were warned.

356,"Hi there, I have been drinking in the last 5 years on a daily routine, around 2 liters of beer a day (six pack) sometimes more.

In the last two years my girlfriend encouraged me to stop drinking and made me understand that I might have a problem, and I started to reduce the amount of days a week that I was drinking until I reached 3 days a week.

Yet after sometime I just returned drinking as I used (only this time 6 days a week and not 7).

Half a year ago I stopped for a bit but I didn’t think it’s a big deal my consumption amount so I went at it again.

The last couple of months I started to wake up every day with the fear of ruining my health and that soon I’ll do non reversal damage to myself, but at the end of each day I felt like it’s still not the time for me to stop, and that I’ll do it in the future.

And then 14 days ago I bought myself 5 beers(half a liter each) planning to have a night drinking with myself, but then my friends went out and I joined them, I had 3 beers with them and went home and drank the entire 5 beers I bought earlier.

The morning after I felt like shit, and the realization that continuing this way will soon lead me to ruin my health if I didn’t do it by now.

It was Thursday morning that I decided to stop cold turkey, I told doctor about it and she sent me to do blood tests a few days later, and it seems I’m ok and I haven’t reached that point yet.

It’s now 192 hours since I did the blood tests and even though I’m ok I didn’t went back in to drinking because, well the anxiety I had about the damages I might have done to myself are very hard to forget and moreover, I don’t want to risk my health.

The withdrawal symptoms and the struggle I had to overcome in these days are obviously another story and this post is long enough by now so I will not expand about it.

I’m here because I really need an advice I got engaged two days ago, and all of my friends want to go out with me and celebrate, my parents wants me to come and raise a toast with them, I haven’t told anyone in my workplace that I got engaged because I’m afraid they will also want to go out and celebrate which means me drinking.

This pressure is really hard on me, I know for sure I cannot attend to all of this events, but to go out with my friend and celebrate is something that I want so much.

I’m considering to go out with them to celebrate and to drink in that single
occasion, but I’m really afraid that it will open the door for my old ways.

on one side I don’t see the harm in drinking with them once, which leads me to think maybe I can occasionally drink only when I go out? 

Like I’m really new at this and I don’t have anyone to talk with, the people around me know I drink a lot but since I’m only drinking beer and only after 10pm they don’t consider me alcohol abuser.

I am doing things that I haven’t done in the 6 months of me living in my new town b/c I am ‘too tired’ (hungover) or would rather be getting drunk instead.

Normally (at least 3x/week), I’m rolling out of bed rushing to work/class with a massive headache and sometimes after being sick. 

 I have started a really structured morning/evening routine and added church/meetings into my week. I feel more clear headed and motivated with my schoolwork which is not something I have felt in a very very long time.

However, do go from ecstatic to crying in literally minutes. I have thought primarily on getting/staying sober with little room for other thoughts. I have gotten so angry at anyone who can drink *normally*. I have been angry with myself. Everyone’s presences makes me happy, then pisses me right off.

363,"Good morning, 

As the title states I am 99 days alcohol free. As I've been doing the steps with my sponsors I've noticed some things about myself and my relationships. There has been a lot of growth and I am really happy. Early in my sobriety I struggled. I grieved alcohol. Today I am not.

Today I think I am grieving something new... What my relationship used to be like with my parents. Our relationship is changing as I go through the program. I don't want to participate in negative talk and gossip about others. I want to be positive and ask God to take away my defects (step 7 is where I am at). I noticed the last time I spent time with my parents my mom snapped at me for something very small. Just your regular run of the mill passive aggressive, manipulative behavior. I found it hard not to go back to old responses... Stand up for myself. My dad tried talking to me about something I didn't want to gossip about. My response was, ""I don't care"". I felt bad. I was beating myself up and feeling down about my response to my father. That it wasn't positive and I didn't participate in his shit talk...

I shouldn't feel bad because I don't want them to control me or make me feel like I'm bad mouthing everything. I just feel like I'm having to say goodbye to something and it feels like a loss. Like I'm grieving. I think that is what I am feeling. I want to figure this feeling out; not feel bad about it nor feel guilty. I feel guilt used to be my go to.

364,"(29f) I know I should maybe bring this up in a meeting as well and have also talked to my sponsor about it but it’s still gnawing at me. 

I’m not very close with my extended family. This mainly stems from a point of being abused by a cousin for an extended time when I temporarily lived with my grandparents. I didn’t feel like my aunts cared about me or wanted to protect me. This has spawned some resentment as an adult and I honestly can’t stand to be around them or any of my cousins for that matter. 

My grandma’s health started rapidly declining about a year ago. According to my mom, my aunts cancelled her life insurance policy and they’ve been mismanaging her funds while she’s been hospitalized for the last year. Essentially there really is no money to bury her and my mom has been trying to save as much as she can now so that she can at least have a decent funeral. 

My mom is a very emotionally needy person and this has really thrown her over the edge. I currently live with her and I honestly have been no help at all. I’ve been sober for about four months now but for the last six weeks I’ve been spiraling through this very deep depression. I do the bare minimum to be functional most days which is just to make it to work and survive  the work day. That’s it. I haven’t really been able to step up and be more responsible with helping out like I was during my grandfather’s last days and i feel bad about it but I was drinking a lot then and stuffing my feelings which I’m not doing now. 

To make a long story short: my mom wants me to travel with her out of state to visit my grandma and assist with possibly getting her established in hospice. There is really no one else she can ask to help her and I just feel like emotionally I can’t do it. I can’t be supportive to her. I can’t be strong now. Not drinking and trying to get a foothold in my 12 step program has felt hard enough. I’m not sure what to do and every time she talks about the situation I get so overwhelmed.

I live at home and mostly drink at night when everyone else is in bed, I’m usually myself during the day because of covid so if I have a hangover or want to have a day drink it’s easy for me to do so, but it’s always at night when I feel a real urge.
I go out every week with my friends, I think my body is getting tired of drinking as I was sick twice which has never happened to me before, the next day I nearly passed out and yet I still drank. The following day I was sick 3 times in 3 hours, I decided to come off drink for the week. Last night I struggled not to drink, I ended up just going to sleep but tonight I caved and had 3 drinks, I had water and food after but I actually feel vile- like I’m going to be sick. 
As I said, I drink every night, I always start before 12am, and usually stop whatever time I feel tired at. The amount of drinks range from about 3-10ish maybe, I noticed none of my classmates drink as much as I do and I’m starting to get concerned. 
I did notice that my drinking was starting to get out of hand, but again I put it down to uni experience which I now don’t think that’s the case. The earliest I’ve had a drink is 11am, before an exam about April time, it was tequila, I drank vodka for the rest of the day, but that’s about the only time I’ve did something like that.  
I used to paint all the time, I loved it so much but I stopped because I was drinking so much during lockdown, I was drunk every night. 
I want to cut back drinking, but when I try I really struggle to, I try to distract myself but I keep thinking about how much better it would be if I had a drink whilst doing it. I’m really embarrassed and don’t want to speak to anyone I know about this which is why I’m asking peoples opinions on here. Idk if this is the start of a problem but if so I need it stopped now before it gets worse. 
Do you have any advice?

375,"This is more of a health question, and although I don't expect ""medical advice"" I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced similar. FWIW I'm 38, \~200 lbs, 5'11.

I used to be a tank maybe 18-28, over time I can't nearly drink as much and I got super sensitive. I figured it out, but still drank often. I'm the ""frat boy"" of my friend group, everyone associates me with a great time, the guy who forces everyone to do shots.

I never used to get hangovers, I used to be a completely high functioning alcoholic.

About a year ago I started getting rapid heart rate, anxiety, things I've never experienced before in and out of drinking. Prior to last year I never had a panic attack ever. Starting March of 2020 I drank very heavily because of lockdown, we made every night a drinking night, sometimes at much as 4-5 mixed drinks (doubles, maybe triples sometimes or if it was wine it was a bottle.

My heart rate was so insane at some points I thought I was having a cardiac event, I remember driving myself to the ER and it was 150bpm while I was just sitting in my car at a stoplight.

Eventually I realized alcohol played a huge role in this, I slowly started to cut back and even took as much as 4-5 weeks off completely. I started to deal with regular panic attacks, depersonalization, and weird head changes....

After adjusting my supplements, getting some blood work done and optimizing I feel just fine most of the time, probably 95%. My blood work shows no liver enzyme issues, but I know those dont check for things like pancreas issues, kidney, etc.

Now... here's the tricky part. If I want to have a couple of drinks, I feel normal while drinking just like I always did, but the next 2-3 days after are half-way-hell... anxiety &amp; panic even if its just like 3 beers, the next day or 3 are terrible.

The question: is this some sort of reaction because I've drank so heavily I've damaged an organ and now this is my body's response, I'm wondering if someone has dealt with this type of issue? Am I fine without alcohol but I'm dealing with AWS (alcohol withdraw symptom) when I drink each time?

Sometimes I have slightly elevated heart rate but I have high blood pressure so 85-90 is not abnormal necessarily. But again if I dont drink for 3-4 days, I'm not dealing with any anxiety, any depersonalization or otherwise.

I can't imagine what else would cause me to have severe adverse reactions the day (or 2-3) after drinking.

Someone told me they consider me a “best friend”and I got triggered cause my best friend is dead, also the fact I have severe insomnia and performance anxiety around sleep, and my previous roommates traumatized me so it’s hard to let people know when they’re noisy but my roommate depriving me of sleep by slamming the door everyday at 5 through 6 am was giving me severe anxiety around bed time about falling to sleep, (it looks like she’s finally stopped doing that, but it took a long time for her to stop,) that contributed to a binge drink. I really want to quit for good and now I know I can’t do it alone. I’m scared of people due to th abuse. So I started drinking to self medicate myself.

384,"I'm currently 41, I've drank off and on since I turned 21, light at first, but then heavy a few years later, like a liter of Jager a night. I ended up in the hospital with my BP at 230/187, my whole body went numb, I couldn't speak, I couldn't move at work. I stayed sober for 2 years, but then went back to it, just not as hard, wine coolers (hate the taste of beer). At about 28 I turned back to hard booze, mainly vodka. I'd buy 1.75 liters and go through it in 3 days, 2 days off, then back to it. I somehow managed to make it like that until I lost my job. Had to quit, which I did, cold turkey, somehow, had klonopin.   


After a year, I went back, got bored with life, back to vodka, same as before. Moved on to wine, because it was less hard, and managed that every night for a year. Finally got caught by my family, was forced to quit again, I managed it, not sure how, it was really rough the first 4 days. Once you got caught tho, the cravings seem to go away. Like you don't want to let people down.... I started back up at 39, to get off the alcohol, I turned to a drug called Tianeptine. I was on it for a year, no drinking, at that was the worse withdrawal I've ever had.... but it worked to stop my drinking. The next year, after experiencing such horrible withdrawal, I was sober.... but since the end of August, I've been constantly back on vodka. It has been 2 months, 1.75 liters every 4 days, one day, feel like crap, then back on it. I'm scared I've gone too hard this time and if I try to quit, I'm going to get the DT's. I do have depression and anxiety, and after 24 hours of not drinking, my anxiety is through the roof and my mind races with horrible thoughts.   


I can't afford to go to rehab, as I now can barely work after f'n up again. I'm afraid if I stop cold turkey, I will die.... but I know if I keep drinking, I will die. What is my best option? My friends and family have lost all hope in me after so many times failing. My liver function was somehow OK after my blood test in July. I need a way out of this. I need some advice. I'm determined to quit, but after 24 hours, I'm just such a mess, I have to drink something. I know that is just an excuse, but I'm scared to death about having a seizure and suffering the DTs.

Defeated, and knowing it, I arrived at the doors of A.A., alone and afraid of the unknown.  A power outside of myself had picked me up off my bed, guided me to the phone book, then to the bus stop, and through the doors of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Once inside A.A.

393,"So, this is really hard for me to post. I've been thinking about it back and forth for about 6 months. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, but I'm also starting to believe that my way of thinking is an excuse as I won't have to deal with it that way. 

My story is as most people these days, trauma etc. I'm not sure though if that's why I'm drinking so much. As a 20 year old I could finish a bottle of wine during breakfast. I used to laugh at myself, thinking that I was ""cosplaying"" an alcoholic. It was silly and I felt in total control. It was a choice that I rarely made. So, rationally, I never thought about it as alcoholism. 

Life moved on, I'm close to 35 today. It started just before the pandemic. I took a glas of red wine every evening. I read an article that it was good for the heart and I thought that it'd be nice to enjoy some wine on my own. I told people at work that it was supposed to be good for the heart and several people asked me if I was an alcoholic. I was pretty upset as I thought that one glas of wine every evening shouldn't be considered anywhere near alcoholism. 

Anyway, covid landed like a bomb in the world and things changed. I started working from home, day one. It all started for me with zoom-parties with friends. We thought it'd be good fun to get drunk on zoom, play games and just enjoy each others company while getting drunk. In truth, I believe we all wanted an excuse to get drunk, and it felt more ""okay"" while talking to each other, pretending we had a party. Thing is though, I believe my friends stopped drinking after the call ended. They probably put the bottle back on the shelf, and went on with their lives. Me, on the other hand, continued. I drank until there was no more to consume. I never considered this alcoholism, just good fun. But - in time I drank more. It started with a glas of wine while cooking dinner. I looked forward to it all day. After a while It got so hard to wait until dinner that I grabbed wine just before I had to start with dinner, usually got so blackout drunk that I skipped dinner. And a while after that I grabbed it while woking my last hour. A while after that I grabbed a glas of wine during 2'o clock break. And then during lunch. And then just before lunch. And finally, I grabbed a beer instead of milk as my drink of choice during breakfast. 

So that's my backstory. Yesterday I spent my savings on alcohol. I couldn't take it being sober on a monday... because, mondays. I promised a friend to meet up in a few days to watch a movie, we talked about grabbing some wine before the movie. I can't afford the wine in a bar, so I'll probably get drunk just before I meet with her. I don't know why I can't watch the movie sober, I just feel that it's impossible. 

My relationship with alcohol has gotten so very intense. And I think it's showing even though no one dares to talk to me about it out loud. I've had friends mention alcoholism, as something they've come in contact with as a relative, friend or a colleague to an alcoholic. I can't help but think that they're trying to talk to me about it.

Even though I know exactly what I did 4 days ago that got me to this point. And I know what happened two weeks before that and a week before that. I thought I had drinking under control and honestly hidden, suppressed and avoided all the wreckage that was headed my way pre-pandemic. The pandemic oddly provided a respite. I replaced drinking heavily with weed and food and sometimes even just happy joyful moments with friends. But lately the stressors have started to pick up the pace and so again has my drinking. The time between huge fuck ups has decreased and the magnitude of the fuck ups has increased at such an astonishingly fast rate. 

And yet I walked into the meeting today feeling like a fraud….like I’m just being dramatic and want attention and that’s why I was in that meeting. I couldn’t say I was an alcoholic out loud. I think that there is a chance I might not be an alcoholic because I don’t drink every day. I still have a great job and a car and a good credit score.

Its my Day10. Its 4am here, wide awake, excited to start new day.

I start to have clarity in my mind and I feel very positive, very happy. I have relapsed numerous times, mostly due to going too fast and being too hyped (or anxiety), or just attending a wedding/funeral saying I can handle. 

Well I can not handle, not even a drop. So my goal is full sobriety today, for the rest of my life every day.

I have always seen AA something which will not work for me. But this time I am willing to try everything. And also, I met a sponsor through this channel. Promised to think about AA somewhere around day12 when I sober up and think straight... time has come for that...

I would love to hear your experiences about virtual AA meetings. If I join, I would like it best if there are people around the world. I have always travelled, so this is something I could really find also motivating apart from AA 12 steps.

Hope some of you have experience and can share these...

I make no promises to actually go, but I am seriously now looking into it...

I (25M) have been drinking since I was 14 years old. I have never felt I have had an issue with alcohol before as I always knew when I had enough. However, over the last couple of years I honestly do not know when to stop.

This has led to a number of black outs recently where I find myself not remembering anything from the night before.  When I go for a drink it can never just be one, I find myself saying ""just one more"" then before I know it I am still in the pub/bar till closing. Even this is not enough as I constantly find myself drinking after I arrive home from the pub.

This isn't just a weekend thing either, I find it hard to just have one drink even though I am working the next day. 

This weekend though, I think I have finally had a breakthrough. Like many weekends before I started drinking on the Friday and continued into early Sunday afternoon. I have very little memory from this weekend and although I have been reassured that I did nothing of interest or make a fool of myself ( I usually do ) it is not a nice feeling knowing that I do not have any memory of the weekend whatsoever.

418,"Hey guys,

Thank you for your replies. 

4 months ago Mom visited, saw me taper and go thru hell at home detoxing. 


Sober 100+ days. Asked her to promise not to drink when she comes to visit. She said yes. Then I can tell she's drinking here. She has extra anxiety provoking energy in day. And bubbly at night. 

I thought I could handle it and didn't say anything. Well it was too much and I drank, got psyical addicted and tapered and sober day 3 or 4 today. 

Asked her to apologize for brining booze in house breaking her promise. She won't. Says I should take responsibility for my drinking. Wrll yes I do, it's my fault, I took the first drink. But knowing there was booze in the house and dealing with the up n downs of her energy added alot of pressure and I drank. I own a biz, have 2 kids and wife, and alot of stressor. 

I don't think me taking responsibility for my drinking has anything to do whatsoever on her breaking her promise. I believe whole heartedly it was a huge trigger for me. Not an excuse, me and my gal know we can't drink. I would have never had mom visit If I knew she was drinking here. Even if she was sneaking it and not coming out of her room, I can feel it. I have empathic qualities and I am so so sensitive to my environment and actively make it the best I can to help me stay sober. 

I mean, my gal and I did our first ever sober 4 night vacay at the beach while mom watched our kids at home. We didn't drink and had such a good time. Neither of us knew if we could do the trip sober, but moment by moment we did. 

A promise is a promise. I wouldn't do herion in my room if I was visiting a hermon addict, if they asked me not to. I would keep my promise or not visit if I knew it was a deal breaker for the person I was visiting. Especially if I saw them shake and sweat and have crippling anxiety going thru withdrawals. 

Well mom and her sister, my aunt, don't believe their is anything to apologize for. Presumably because my drinking is on me. But I am careful as heck about my life choices and situations to give me the best possible chances to stay sober. 

She feels no remorse, just points finger back at me. I'm not saying I 100 drank because her and uts her fault, I am saying I know my triggers and limits and made my boundaries clear before letting her visit. 

I would love just some thoughts from anyone. Maybe I am wrong about everything. I could be of course. 

Like if she just quit smoking and she said I can't visit her if I smoke on the trip and I agree. Then I visit and smoke in my room anyway. Just seems like ya, I would be wrong to break my promise and feel some remorse and small responsibility for her relapse. Because if I didn't do that, she wouldn't of been around me smoking and smelling like smoke and sneaking off to smoke while we both know what I'm doing without saying it.

423,"... And FINALLY, really working the steps. Wasn't ready until I was ready and now I'm ready. Some of us get to be in the 'sometimes slowly' category. The important thing is that it works - especially when you work it. It's not like I've been sitting around doing nothing while not drinking. Been doing lots of other practices - breathwork, meditation, yoga, sauna, cold water immersion, intense daily journaling, connecting with what I now consider my higher power - and during Covid I had the luxury of being able to spend almost all of last year in the woods/fishing/camping/exploring all the local places that are normally overrun with tourists (Alaska). Oh, and being of service chairing/hosting a weekly online Zoom meeting with my wife (20 years in the program). All of which set me up mentally/emotionally/spiritually, to now do the work of the steps for real. Which was good because when I caught Covid last month, it hit me hard (grateful for the vaccine - suspect I'd have died otherwise), and I came out of it with the worst depression I've had in years. I wallowed until my - much wiser - wife suggested I go back to basics and work the first three steps. Got myself a brand-new-old-school sponsor, and I've been working the program harder than anything I've worked at before. Not just half-stepping and playing lip service to it, but committing to it completely. Hey, got news for you folks that are on the fence - IT WORKS! After writing about 20 pages in step 4 (didn't know I had that much resentment!), I've started step 5 and looking forward to the rest of it. Have had just a hint of a taste of the comprehension of the word serenity, and I've even had a few precious moments of genuine peace.

So yeah, I got sober 6 years ago. Life was pretty sucky. Life was miserable. I had a ready made family that loved me, and supported me.  I had everything I ever wanted. A loyal and great woman, 2 daughters and a son. I had everything but the nice car, house, picket fence, and dog. But still drugs were all I gave a shit about. I mean, I cared and loved my family, sure.  But I loved the feelings drugs produced more. Then one day, drugs stopped producing those feelings that I loved. And suddenly, I could no longer deal with the world and the chaos I created. I knew how to be clean but didn’t know how to be sober. Didn’t know how to live life on life’s terms. My fix was no longer fixing a goddamn thing, in fact my fix was making things exponentially worse.  It’s a tricky spot to be in when you’re sick of living but too scared to die.  Suicide was contemplated, attempted, and failed. 

That day I failed for the last time and gave in to the notion that I had a problem, needed help, wanted help, and would succeed or die trying to get better. 6 years later I’m recovered. I have my off days sure, anxiety, depression, commitment problems, disdain for authority, still love starting chaos, saying things when I should bite my tongue, saying things incorrectly without regards to others feelings, posting shitty memes, and starting facebook dumpster fires. I’m not perfect. But now a days, I don’t really enjoy being the center of attention, I actually get anxious over it (no one who remembers the old me would ever believe that!).  Nowadays, I do have the nice car, the house, the picket fence, 2 cats and a dog!! It’s wild to me. 

Today was a huge day for me and my son. But in typical selfish me form, I’m concentrating on why it was so huge to me…Since little Pete was born I always wanted to take him to a NFL football game. And do all that cool shit you see other Dads doing with their kids on TV and in Movies. ALWAYS. But it always seemed like a pipe dream to me during my days of active addiction. Then I got clean and in my mind I made mental notes, a check list of sorts, of things I wanted to accomplish or at least try to accomplish.  I’ve checked off a TON. And today was another one of them. Today was super special to me and I hope to my son too. We were gifted an opportunity from a random stranger to make this memory. And after the game on our drive home there was a homeless guy asking for money…me and Pete gave him a few bucks. I asked Pete if he knew why? He said “You do good things so you get good things in return”. And I smiled and said “Yes and no, dude.  We’re supposed to pay it forward and do good things without expectation of anything in return.  We had a blast today because someone did something nice for us and didn’t want anything in return, so we pay it forward like Lindsey Kozecke would always tell us to do”. Pete looked at me and said “Ahhh I got ya, but he did want you to do something in return…he wanted you to take that video with him and send him pictures.”  I smiled and was like “Damn, touché” the kid is wise beyond his years, because even though we say we do good things for others without any expectation of anything in return and try to practice altruism…ultimately it is for some self-serving purpose no matter how minute it may be. For me, my self-serving purpose is to continue to be blessed enough to make these kind of memories with my family. Best part about being sober is there is no “set” check list, it’s all tentative…we just keep adding to the list day by day. Thanks Lindsey, miss ya.

This isn’t to diminish the things I’ve done with each of my daughters. We have our memories too. Individual and as a family unit. I hope when they see this they don’t think I don’t love them or not proud of them. Trust me ladies, we’ve checked off many on my list too! Proud of all my kids.",alcoholicsanonymous, game day photoshttpsmimgurcomassghzji yeah got sober 6 year ago life pretty sucky life miserable ready made family loved supported everything ever wanted loyal great woman 2 daughter son everything nice car house picket fence dog still drug gave shit mean cared loved family sure loved feeling drug produced one day drug stopped producing feeling loved suddenly could longer deal world chaos created knew clean know sober know live life life term fix longer fixing goddamn thing fact fix making thing exponentially worse tricky spot sick living scared die suicide contemplated attempted failed day failed last time gave notion problem needed help wanted help would succeed die trying get better 6 year later recovered day sure anxiety depression commitment problem disdain authority still love starting chaos saying thing bite tongue saying thing incorrectly without regard others feeling posting shitty meme starting facebook dumpster fire perfect day really enjoy center attention actually get anxious one remembers old would ever believe nowadays nice car house picket fence 2 cat dog wild today huge day son typical selfish form concentrating huge since little pete born always wanted take nfl football game cool shit see dad kid tv movie always always seemed like pipe dream day active addiction got clean mind made mental note check list sort thing wanted accomplish least try accomplish checked ton today another one today super special hope son gifted opportunity random stranger make memory game drive home homeless guy asking money pete gave buck asked pete knew said good thing get good thing return smiled said yes dude supposed pay forward good thing without expectation anything return blast today someone something nice u want anything return pay forward like lindsey kozecke would always tell u pete looked said ahhh got ya want something return wanted take video send picture smiled like damn touché kid wise beyond year even though say good thing others without expectation anything return try practice altruism ultimately selfserving purpose matter minute may selfserving purpose continue blessed enough make kind memory family best part sober set check list tentative keep adding list day day thanks lindsey miss ya diminish thing done daughter memory individual family unit hope see think love proud trust lady checked many list proud kid

428,"My dad (53) has always enjoyed a cocktail in the evenings. But he has ALWAYS been able to hold his liquor. I (26) was never aware of any issues growing up. My parents divorced when I was 12 and my dad lives on my grandparents property in a studio style cottage.

My grandpa (dads side) is addicted to any pain relief he can get his hands on. Primarily pills and pain patches, but alcohol will do if he can’t get his hands on his meds. He has been like that his entire life. His brother (my dads uncle) struggled with addiction as well. I’ve never seen my dad take so much as an Advil. So I thought he escaped the genetic predisposition. 

Both my grandparents have health problems. My grandma more so is declining RAPIDLY and my dad is their primary caretaker since he lives there. It’s depressing to watch and exhausting to deal with. She’s on oxygen right now and it’s really an ordeal to take her anywhere because she’s weak and can barely walk on her own let alone carry her oxygen.  Shes still working full time because my grandpa spent every penny they ever made. So they can’t afford to go into assisted living or have an aide come to the house. Nor do they “want” an aide. 

 I have begun noticing my dad is drinking a lot more. He was never visibly drunk when I was a kid, but now when I see him and he is drinking, he slurs some words or speaks a lot slower because he’s making sure he doesn’t slur. He uses excessive hand movements when storytelling. It’s just all too obvious that he’s wasted. I’ve also noticed he has shaky hands even when I know he’s not drinking. I used to wonder if it was Parkinson’s. But now I think it’s from not drinking. 

My father, who is a very strong willed man, has opened up on a few occasions about the immense pressure he’s under taking care of my grandparents. He’s working full time, but coming home to make sure they’re cared for. His only peace of the day is when he’s asleep. Work is his escape from his responsibilities. But work is it’s own pressure. 

As far as I’m aware, he does not drink and go to work. But he drinks at night when he comes home. 

I’m worried, and I don’t know what to do about it. It’s unlikely to stop while my grandparents are alive. I don’t even know what to say. I either tell him I’m worried and put MORE on his plate, or I say nothing and watch him drink.  Or I tell him I’m worried and expect him to stop drinking and just live with the pressure closing in on him? 

Any input appreciated",alcoholicsanonymous,dad 53 always enjoyed cocktail evening always able hold liquor 26 never aware issue growing parent divorced 12 dad life grandparent property studio style cottage grandpa dad side addicted pain relief get hand primarily pill pain patch alcohol get hand med like entire life brother dad uncle struggled addiction well never seen dad take much advil thought escaped genetic predisposition grandparent health problem grandma declining rapidly dad primary caretaker since life depressing watch exhausting deal oxygen right really ordeal take anywhere weak barely walk let alone carry oxygen shes still working full time grandpa spent every penny ever made afford go assisted living aide come house want aide begun noticing dad drinking lot never visibly drunk kid see drinking slur word speaks lot slower making sure slur us excessive hand movement storytelling obvious wasted also noticed shaky hand even know drinking used wonder parkinson think drinking father strong willed man opened occasion immense pressure taking care grandparent working full time coming home make sure cared peace day asleep work escape responsibility work pressure far aware drink go work drink night come home worried know unlikely stop grandparent alive even know say either tell worried put plate say nothing watch drink tell worried expect stop drinking live pressure closing input appreciated

431,"I’ve been fortunate in that the obsession was lifted from me early on in sobriety. This month will be 4 years. I still have work to do and I still have a long list of amends I’m in the process of making. 

I got into a relationship recently, and it’s illuminated a lot of defects I’ve been able to avoid by remaining single. It’s become even clearer to me how important completing my amends is, and how important it is to let go of my own will and have patience. 

I don’t think I’d want to date somebody who’s also a sober alcoholic. I like the fact that I’m dating a “fun” girl, and I’ve never felt any degree of insecurity over being sober in a social situation. But this relationship has really challenged me. I am finding myself having a tougher time than ever feeling comfortable in sobriety, and I even picked up smoking again (and quit again, and will smoke the off cigarette and have to go through the quitting process).

I don’t think my girlfriend is an alcoholic, but it’s really hard to say because I have such a distorted view of alcohol and the last thing I want to do is take somebody else’s inventory. 

She seemingly can stop once she starts, but drinks more nights than not and was easily the drunkest person at a gathering she had tonight. It shouldn’t bother me, but it does. All things equal I care about and enjoy her.

434,"Hi Folks,

*Disclaimer: I made this account just to post here, but I’ve been a Redditor for almost a decade.*

I am newly sober (yay!). I recognized I had a problem, told my wife, and got help. Went through a medical detox (I recommend this for hard core drinkers ready to quit), and now I’m in an Intense Outpatient Program (IOP). I realize that when my treatment program is complete, I’ll need continued support. I have a therapist lined up, and I’ve been to an AA meeting. I am/was planning on AA as a big part of recovery plan.

Here’s my issue and, as a newbie, I hope you guys can give me some direction/guidance. I am a hardcore atheist. I’ve been an atheist activist for many years. I’ve had some conversations about this with my therapist, but not to the extent I’d like. I’ve read chapter 4 of the big book regarding this, and it didn’t give me a truly satisfying answer (besides being a painful read)

Some other points to give further context:

- I am going into this with an open heart and open mind.

- There are definitely elements in AA that I think are very valuable, and I believe can help me maintain my sobriety.

- The AA meeting I attended was very welcoming, but very religious. In their defense, a big part of that was that the topic was the prayer from *According to Bill* regarding step 3.


And some hurdles:

- I’ve been studying philosophy for more than three decades. I know that we can’t generally just choose our beliefs. We’re either convinced or were not.

- I’m not sure what spiritually is. I’ve never heard a coherent definition of spiritual. 

- I’ve talked to folks who say that we can choose anything to be our higher power (someone even suggested a doorknob). If we’re just using things like that (not actual god(s)), aren’t we then really relying on ourselves? Something antithetical to the central tenet of AA?

- I was also told that this higher power had to be all-powerful and has to have the ability to enact the change that I’m not capable of. Is this true? It seems to contradict some of the point in the previous bullet.

Thank you, in advance, for any guidance you can give me. My responses might seem argumentative, or that I’m the very picture of Bill’s (mischaracterization) of what atheism is, but, I’m just being as honest as I can. If AA is not an option for me, I’d like to know sooner rather than later.",alcoholicsanonymous,hi folk disclaimer made account post redditor almost decade newly sober yay recognized problem told wife got help went medical detox recommend hard core drinker ready quit intense outpatient program iop realize treatment program complete need continued support therapist lined aa meeting amwas planning aa big part recovery plan issue newbie hope guy give directionguidance hardcore atheist atheist activist many year conversation therapist extent like read chapter 4 big book regarding give truly satisfying answer besides painful read point give context going open heart open mind definitely element aa think valuable believe help maintain sobriety aa meeting attended welcoming religious defense big part topic prayer according bill regarding step 3 hurdle studying philosophy three decade know generally choose belief either convinced sure spiritually never heard coherent definition spiritual talked folk say choose anything higher power someone even suggested doorknob using thing like actual god really relying something antithetical central tenet aa also told higher power allpowerful ability enact change capable true seems contradict point previous bullet thank advance guidance give response might seem argumentative picture bill mischaracterization atheism honest aa option like know sooner rather later

How come you don't drink anymore? 

""How come you don't drink anymore?"" a renewed acquaintance from long ago asked the other day.
""Anymore than who?, I asked.
""I mean any longer. How come you don't drink anything these days?""
""Drink? I drink...coffee, milk, juice, tea, soda pop, water...""

""I mean drink"" he said. "" you know, booze.""
""Oh, booze, No I don't drink booze any more, you're right,"" I said, I couldn't' trust it anymore. It turned on me. Once my friend, it became my enemy.""

""Maybe you got a bad batch."" he said.

""No the sauce is the same. I changed. Because I have this illness of alcoholism, my tolerance weakened. Alcoholism doesn't come in bottles, it comes in people.""

""Sounds pretty confusing"" the fellow said

""You think you're confused,"" I said, ""You should have seen me. I drank for happiness and became unhappy... I drank for joy and became miserable... I drank to be outgoing and became self centered... I drank for sociability and became argumentative and lonely."" I drank for sophistication and became rude and obnoxious...I drank for friendship and made enemies... I drank to soften sorrow and wallowed in self pity... I drank for sleep and awakened without rest.

I drank for strength and felt weak.. I drank medicinally and got sick.. I drank because I thought my job called for it and I lost my job.. I drank for relaxation and got the shakes.. I drank for confidence and became uncertain.. I drank for courage and became afraid.. I drank for assurance and became doubtful... I drank to stimulate thought and blacked out... I drank to make conversation and it tied my tongue... I drank for warmth and lost my cool. I drank for coolness and lost my warmth... I drank to feel heaven and came to know hell. I drank to forget and became haunted. I drank for freedom and became a slave...I drank to erase problems and saw them multiply... I drank to cope with life and invited death ..or worse... I drank because I had the right and everything turned out wrong..

""Gosh!"" My friend exclaimed, ""That must have taken a bunch of booze to get you in that shape. 
""Just one"" I told him, ""The first one. For me one is too many, and a thousand is not enough.""

444,"Hey everyone,

A little over a month ago I had posted about how I had engaged in gossip (character assassination), and how I had had to endure the consequences of that. Some people in the fellowship had turned against me. I basically ended up leaving AA as a whole. I quit all my service positions and left my sponsor. 

A few days after leaving, my hands started to get all sweaty and my thoughts started racing the way I used to before I was in the program. I actually got trembling hands. It actually felt as if I was going through alcohol withdrawal. 

I basically  had 2 options: relapse or be a dry drunk, or go back to AA. I live in the relatively small town with a rather small AA fellowship, so it's pretty impossible to go to completely different meetings and never run into those people again. I contacted my old sponsor and she's my sponsor again. I've also resumed my service positions.

445,"Alright so...

I had a problem with drinking in the first half of the year and a medical problem that (seemed at first) life threatening forced me to quit, with my family's support.

Recently I've had to move to a different city alone and after a particularly stressful day decided it would be good to celebrate my health progress with a few glasses of wine 

I was irritable, felt my head hurt, thought I'd be relaxed enough to sleep but just got more uncomfortable, everything about my body felt wrong.
The first half glass felt okay, I could imagine it helping me get more social if I was with friends but after that? WHY DID I LIKE THIS SHIT 

ITS HORRIBLE. MY HEAD HURT. I WAS TOSSING AND TURNING TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP.

I thought this would help me relax and it didn't?

I guess this is good, it seems I've finally managed to get more normal in my affinity for Alcohol.

446,"A DAILY TUNE-UP

Every day is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of our activities.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

How do I maintain my spiritual condition?  For me it's quite simple: on a daily basis I ask my Higher Power to grant me the gift of sobriety for that day!  I have talked to many alcoholics who have gone back to drinking and I always ask them: 'Did you pray for sobriety the day you took your first drink?'  Not one of them said yes.  As I practice Step Ten and try to keep my house in order on a daily basis, I have the knowledge that if I ask for a daily reprieve, it will be granted.

450,"5 years ago met a girl in a drug rehabilitation program (romantic I know).... Had some of the most amazing times of my life. But, also some of the craziest. Relapse, after relapse (shooting heroin) homelessness, saved her life probably 20 plus times from overdoses ( narcan, hospitals,cpr) she probably saved mine 10 plus times as well. We use to have people pay us to have sex in front of them while they masturbate. Homeless on east and west coast. We both were accomplished musicians busking in the city for money while dopesick. In between these times were some sustained periods of sobriety and something that resembled normalcy. We had a son, he was conceived in California. We came back east for the pregnancy, got at an apartment and six weeks after he was born our apartment building burned down (we were in the building when it caught on fire.. Thankfully, we escaped with our son but we lost all our possessions. We moved into her parents house and relapsed hard and after some time went to treatment. During the process we broke up for 6 months and then tried to work it out. But it seemed like too much damage had been done. She broke up with me and started dating another guy 2 weeks later. She got an apartment 3 doors down (that I can see from my bedroom). It torments me I still love her. After 2 months she got pregnant with new guy. Came over my house told me she still loves me and thinks about being with me (while pregnant) asks me if she should get an abortion? I told her that's on her. She gets abortion goes back with other guy and acts like she never said the things she said. I'm so devastated. I'm handling it pretty well (all things considered). I logically know we can't be together. But, after experiencing life on such an intense level (death, homelessness, degradation, miracle of a child etc) I don't know if I'll ever be the same. We both have about a year sober now. I've started a business and started doing pretty well financially and working a rigorous AA program. But, I'm very afraid of intimacy with another woman.

460,"Whether you're confident or insecure, a genius or intellectually challenged, tall or short, fat or thin, bald or bestowed with a luscious mane, manic or depressed, anxious or laid back, or anything in between...

God designed us to be exactly who we are. Our self- perceived assets and shortcomings may be hard to grapple with. But what God bestowed us with are God's gifts to us. What we do with these qualities are our gifts back to God. The sooner we can accept and take accountability for the roles we have been given, the more readily we can embrace our journeys. 

I may not like being a sensitive person, but God likes it because it makes me compassionate. I may not see the value in my health problems, but God didn't create me this way for no reason. If I think about my challenges hard enough, I can see how they might be worked into qualities that benefit the world and make me a better person.

The next time you find yourself cursing your bad hair, your stutter, or those extra ten pounds, remember that they're not meaningless. Just like your ability to comfort a grieving friend, ace that biology exam, or bake the best cookies in town aren't, either. 

We struggle to see ourselves through God's lens rather than the world's, but which of these perspectives actually matters? I believe that when we die these confusing conditions will make more sense. But what if we could learn to accept the roles that we've been given before that? How would that change the quality of our lives, and the lives of those around us?

Today I encourage all of us to examine the possible meanings behind our many qualities. How can we use them to make the world a kinder, gentler, more beautiful place?

463,"I'm so confused, and I'm not sure if I'm actually an alcoholic or what my problem is? 

I got arrested for 4th OWI in February and started going to AA meetings, but in the back of my mind there was always this little doubt telling me I want really an alcoholic and I'm being over dramatic and just want attention or something. I do relate in meetings, and people seem to relate with me when I share but this little seed of doubt has not gone away. 

I ended up relapsing in August after 6 months and struggled to stay sober for a full day all through September. September 28th I got drunk for the last time and started going to meetings again on the 29th. 

I typically drink 5-6 days a week, and I black out about half the time, maybe more, I'm not sure. At this point I mostly drink on my own at home because I'm afraid of blacking out in public, but that doesn't stop the shame and embarrassment I feel the next morning. Not to mention the drunk texts/ phone calls that I don't remember. 

The other day on this sub I made a comment about how ""when I try to control my drinking I can't enjoy it, and when I try to enjoy it I can't control it."" And another user here started telling me that I wasn't an alcoholic and they weren't sure why I wanted to be an alcoholic so badly and that ""my disabilities"" don't make me an alcoholic, and that alcoholics recognize each other and they don't see it with me. 

Other than depression and anxiety I don't have any known disabilities, and I'm just very confused now, mostly because they said things that I've always kind of thought were true, that I'm not actually an alcoholic, and I don't really belong in AA. 

I was feeling pretty good about my Sobriety until that altercation, now all I can think about is getting drunk to ""prove them wrong"" even though they're a stranger on the internet who is now blocked and will never know or care whether they were right or wrong. Basically, I'm just tired of arguing with myself about everything. I thought I was doing the right thing, now I feel like I'm just wasting people's time going to meetings and that I really don't belong there.

This is not an overnight matter.  It should continue for our lifetime.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

During my early years in A.A. I saw Step Ten as a suggestion that I periodically look at my behavior and reactions.  If there was something wrong, I should admit it; if an apology was necessary, I should give one.  After a few years of sobriety I felt I should undertake a self-examination more frequently.  Not until several more years of sobriety had elapsed did I realize the full meaning of Step Ten, and the word 'continued.'  'Continued' does not mean occasionally, or frequently.  It means throughout each day.

471," I think I finally get what the book means by self seeking

Well, this isn’t a philosophical debate about split words and picking apart the nuance of the book. I must admit I do enjoy that sort of thing. It’s just not what I’m going to be talking about here…. You’re welcome. Instead, this is a sort of fifth step.

I say, “sort of” for two reasons. Primarily because it’s not a first fifth step. I’m one of those guys that upon ‘finishing’ the steps loops back to the start and goes through it again. I do believe and practice my daily maintenance steps, but I also find it rewarding to slowly go back and focus on each step one at a time. 

Unfortunately, I don’t have a sponsor right now, and I just moved so I let myself off the hook and decided not to share the fifth step. After all, the book says this step can be postponed. So I justified my fear with that excuse.

Some may say what I’m sharing here isn’t a fifth step at all. To them, I say, “yup you’re right. I’m probably confused.” Instead what this could be is a portion of our maintenance steps. It’s around steps 10 and 11 where the book suggests we ask ourselves if we have kept anything to ourselves which should be shared with another alcoholic.

The second reason I say this is only sort of a fifth step, is that a fifth step is when I share on the defects revealed by the fourth step. This is only about one defect because it flows from one resentment.

Tonight, I said the seventh step prayer as I thought I was on this step. Trust me I'm sick and tired of this defect. It’s unbearably painful and has caused repeated difficulty in my life. 

However, as I said the prayer I was hit with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I know I haven’t told anyone about this defect. I argued with myself at first, stating I talk about it all the time. Probably too much! People are tired of hearing about it at this point.

Here’s the thing. No matter how badly I would like it to count, complaining about the other person is not the same as revealing my defect. 

So here it is. My great big defect is self seeking.

Yup, I like sticking to the four categories the book lists, but don’t worry I’m not letting myself off that easily. I will elaborate and give specifics.

This term has produced great confusion for me. It sounds so much like selfishness it’s hard for me to conceptualize what it is. I think I get it now, and I think it’s my problem.

It started to make sense when I heard someone say they were seeking self in others. And that, my friends, is a definition I can work with. The instant I heard them say that I related.

It’s absolutely something I do and have done. Its resulted in so much headache and pain in my life. 

When I was 15 I had enough of my Dad. For the purpose of brevity, I’ll keep the jist of that relationship to one sentence: he hurt me badly repeatedly. At 15 I said no and refused to return to his house. 

It was for my emotional well being and I do not regret the decision. It was the right call according to logic and reason.

Emotions, as we all know, don’t often accept reason and logic. Looking back on it I can see that rejecting my Father left me deeply wounded. I wanted so much from him. I wanted his love, approval, and respect. I wanted my Dad to be proud of me, and he simply wasn't.

If I take the book's suggestion to view the other person as sick, well maybe he just wasn’t capable of those things. Or more charitably, he wasn’t capable of displaying those things in a healthy and normal manner.

Regardless, I belive my father was an early example act of self seeking. Don’t get me wrong, I was perfectly normal for feeling those feelings. The self seeking aspect is that I was seeking my self worth in him. 

I’m not anything like a psychologist, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this is a normal thing for a boy to do. How then can such a normal thing be a defect? Well, one answer comes from the 12 and 12: our natural healthy instincts can get out of whack over the course of life. 

Additionally, I don’t believe a defect is all that bad of a thing. That is to say, I don’t view defects as sin. They certainly can be, and frequently present themselves as such, but it’s my understanding that they are simply defects in my character. 

If I were a line of code it would be an error, and my divine developer would like my permission to correct it, so that I may function in line with my true nature. At this point in my program (no pun intended) it doesn’t hurt my feelings (AS MUCH AS IT USED TO) to discover a new defect. 

After the age of father idolization came to an end, I got myself a high school sweetheart. She was my world. I ignored my friends, family, and school work to be with her. I thought I was in love with her. I wasn’t. Real love is something akin to admiring a moth that lands on your porch. You don’t grab it and make it yours forever. 

I did - metaphorically - grab that girl and try and make her mine forever. Self seeking. That searching for myself, my value, in her was not love, but a defect. A defect that made the end of the relationship unbearable.

It was at that time I began seeking comfort in a bottle.

The self seeking didn’t evaporate with the liquor. Instead, it carried on with numerous people. My drug dealer, my next girlfriend, and the girl after that, to name a few.

You might be wondering at this point if I’m confused and actually uncovered codependency. Well, maybe. I don’t think so, but I see where you're coming from because I’m wondering the same thing.

I don’t know that much about codependency, so my analysis is rudimentary at best. That being said, I think codependency is… when you're dependent on another person. Perhaps self seeking, as I interpret it, can rise to a level of dependence.

Yet, at its core, I think self seeking is something you do to yourself. These instances I’m sharing about involve other people, but I don’t think that is a necessity of the defect. When I’m honest, as I can be with myself, I see that this defect also occurred with positions of status.

For example, I was raised Christian and went to a Christian school. I looked for value in my Christianity, and I don’t mean I found my self worth in my faith. I was not about that. I looked for value in the status of being ‘holier' than my Christian peers. It was about the status of it.

I later did the same thing with my position in Boy Scouts - I will be the best Senior Patrol Leader not to help you, but to seek myself in that position of status. Then later as a stoner I let you know how I skipped work and class on April 20th, so I could validate my identity. When I got into shrooms I bragged about ego death - the irony was lost on me - to validate my self perception.

This brings us to the most recent time this defect burnt me. I lost a close friend. I want to tell you all the little petty things he did to me, and gripe and moan about him, but honestly, it doesn’t matter. In reality, he didn’t do anything too bad to me. 

He did some stuff and I did some stuff. We’ve had arguments. We’ve been dicks to each other from time to time. It happens when you’re that close to a person. 

He changed over the years and so did I. We got on each other's nerves more and more frequently because of those changes. I ended up getting a different job and moving. Now we don’t talk.

In the good old days, we had an inside joke about a certain number. It became his number. It seems that every time I look at a page number, the time, my phone’s battery, or a license plate I see the number, and I’m filled with anger. Every petty thing he ever did wrong comes rushing back to my mind.

It’s been months and I’m sick and tired of this resentment. 

The reason it hurts so damn bad is because I was absolutely  seeking myself in him. I remained his close friend for so long, not because I valued his company, but because I had to. After all, who is Burton Guster without Shawn Spencer? Who is Robin without Batman? ^((Nightwing)) Shaggy is just a stoner without scooby-doo.

It wasn’t fair of me to put that burden of self validation on anyone else's shoulders. It’s essentially a lie; a distortion of the truth. Rather than seeing who those people were, I saw who I wanted them to be. I can’t really get to know them if I’m seeing a mirage of who they are. Maybe I knew them well at one point in time, but I can’t watch them grow as a person when I’m, by nature of self seeking, only seeing the aspects of them that validate me.

This self seeking via another person limits my ability to be a good friend because I’m approaching the relationship selfishly. This aspect of the defect doesn’t really apply to institutions and status, but the next portion applies to everything.

Self seeking harms me. It keeps me from seeing the position or person as they really are. It’s the opposite of acceptance and a total lack of self respect. When I look for my value in external places it’s selling myself short. It’s robbing me of truly knowing myself.

I said earlier that I’m sick and tired of this defect. I am, but at the same time, I see why the book tells me to pause and review the other steps before moving on. I need them in order to take step six. In order to truly be willing to have this defect removed, I must be willing to truly experience reality. I must be willing to learn who I am. 

That terrifies this alcoholic.

It's only through using those first three steps can I possibly take the next two.

472,"Hey guys. I’m 29.  I don’t want to drink everyday of my life, I have a job I have a commitment to and never want my drinking to be a hinderance to that. I never go to work hungover, I hate it. I only drink Friday and Saturday nights when I don’t have work the next day. But I look forward to drinking every weekend and not just a couple drinks, I want to get /drunk/ every weekend. Not to the point of being what you would say is “fucked up” but enough to definitely be drunk and have experienced moments of being blacked out regularly. 

My struggle is that alcoholism runs in my family. My dad was (is? Idk I don’t see him a lot these days) an alcoholic and so was his dad. I reserve weekends to getting drunk, that’s what I look forward to. Only maybe one weekend every three weeks or so am I not in the mood. Most of the time if I have a couple of beers I want to continue until I get drunk and then stop. 

My bf likes to drink as well but his dad is an alcoholic and he doesn’t want to end up like him so I want to limit my drinking for his sake. 

I don’t want to consider myself an alcoholic but I want to know if my behavior puts me at risk and what I should do to stop it while I can.

So I created a new account and started [posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g26i1m/celebrating_18_months_just_went_through_my_post/) about my journey. That was around 4.5 years ago. 

Long story short, today I celebrate 3 years since I took a drink and it turns out, in order to stay stopped, I did need AA, I do need AA lol. I spent the first year and a half trying to get sober my way, I would go to AA but also hated it and its culty people trying to tell me what to do. Finally, I was so miserable from relapses, I decided to be full in and get a sponsor and work all the steps. For me, it was the only option I had left, my doctors and therapists couldn't keep me sober. 

Sorry for the click-baity title, but I'm sure a lot of you can relate. This isn't to say that AA is the end all for recovery, or that there aren't other ways to stay sober ( I love r/stopdrinking!). But for me, it's what ended up working as a long term solution, but it took me about 2.5 years to believe that. Sometimes quickly sometimes slowwwwwlllllyyyyy.

475,"My drinking career was quite short. A couple years only. During that time I was almost completely isolated from everyone and only seriously interacted with two people. I am autistic so I have no friends and haven’t for years. I had no real job except a very part-time one. Before coming to A.A. I only interacted with my mom, who I lived with off and on, and occasionally my dad through superficial interactions. 

So my list of people I harmed is very short. The main one being my mother who had to put up with me living with her while I was an emotional wreck. I owe her money, that’s easy. Other than that I just don’t know what to do except tell her I’m sorry and try to be helpful and kind to her.

I feel like there is more I should do but I just don’t know what. Am I overthinking it? And before you say it, yes I have talked to my sponsor about it.

I spent the first 2 days of sobriety in a hospital for detox before just leaving to get off the Ativan (paradoxical reaction had me feeling worse than drinking or being hung over). 
I was a heavy whiskey drinker (IMO) 1-2 pints a day, plus seltzers for chasers. While functioning, I was merely in auto pilot. I feared the physical withdrawal the worst and think that’s what kept me from being sober so long.

At first, it was a big source of shame for me and I kept it a secret from my female friends in the program but eventually after just going through so much emotional turmoil I started to open up to people including my sponsor about what was going on.

I was leaving my usual meeting and as I got into my car an overwhelming wave of 'everything is going to be ok' washed over me. I felt completely accepted, like my AA hall was where I belonged my entire life. I was alone in my car and the emotions I was feeling were equivalent to my parents giving me a hug and telling me they loved me. 

Later, going through the steps with a sponsor, we get to chapter 4. I read it and get to those two quotes. And everything clicks. I finally know that I don't have to definitively know who or what my higher power is. I just have to know that it is. I'd felt that feeling I got in my car before, maybe not to that magnitude, but I'd felt it.

Gossip barbed with our anger, a polite form of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us, too.  Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 67

Sometimes I don't realize that I gossiped about someone until the end of the day, when I take an inventory of the day's activities, and then, my gossiping appears like a blemish in my beautiful day.  How could I have said something like that?  Gossip shows its ugly head during a coffee break or lunch with business associates, or I may gossip during the evening, when I'm tired from the day's activities, and feel justified in bolstering my ego at the expense of someone else.  Character defects like gossip sneak into my life when I am not making a constant effort to work the Twelve Steps of recovery.  I need to remind myself that my uniqueness is the blessing of my being, and that applies equally to everyone who crosses my path in life's journey.  Today the only inventory I need to take is my own.  I'll leave judgment of others to the Final Judge - Divine Providence.

499,"I thought about making a throwaway account but screw it. 

I’ve been able to be sober for about 10-11 months twice since I started drinking because I was pregnant with my two beautiful girls. PPD with my oldest didn’t help me at all and I’m not using it as an excuse. Nobody would listen to me. The antidepressants my doctor put me on made it worse. So, I said to hell with it and drank. My oldest was about a month-month and a half old. When I drank I wasn’t angry at everyone (minus my daughter… my PPD never targeted her), myself or the world. It felt like everything just lifted off my shoulders and I finally felt somewhat normal. That should of been a massive red flag but I was so deep in my depression, a whole carnival of red flags could of been right in my face and I wouldn’t of even noticed it. I drank quite a bit before my oldest but after PPD, it got so much worse. 

Due to the PPD it took 6 years before I was finally ready to try for another child. I got pregnant pretty instantly. I’m talking within a month. 🤣 Unfortunately, we lost that one within a month. Two months later, we were gifted our rainbow. Again, sober whole pregnancy. She was a month old when I took that drink. I thought, “Well, I’ll have DH handle the kids and have a chill night and relax.” I look back now and laugh, not with humor but with disgust. It’s never just one night is it? She’ll be five in five months.

I know I need to stop. Went two days without drinking this week which is a big deal for me. Then, last night, my bright self decided to just finish what was left of my little under half 5th of Jim Beam. It takes a lot to get me drunk anymore and I wasn’t drunk. Decent buzz but something happened when I laid down to go to bed. My heart was racing, my brain was going every which direction and I almost started crying because I realized I don’t like that feeling anymore. I felt out of control. I felt out of control with my body, my emotions. This is the first time where I’ve said to myself, “Im done.” Im not even sad. Im not anxious about it and I have horrible anxiety. Im never calm! 

I live in a small town and really don’t want to attend AA meetings here but I can’t drive 45 minutes to the nearest town, either. I don’t care about seeing “Billy” or “Martha” at the grocery store. Im just a private person and I’m embarrassed and ashamed. I just wanted to know if there’s anyway to get a sponsor online and do online AA meetings where I don’t have to show my face. I’m talker and I need someone who understands and I can talk to on the bad days because I know they’re coming.

Only occasionally, i had a few friends over 21 who could get me alcohol, it slowly started getting more and more. I would buy a bottle every other week and finish it myself.

511,"I’m at 1 month, 12 days, 1 hour, and 38 minutes since I walked out of the ER after my final detox. 

Just about everything life could throw at me, it did, when I first got sober, and looking back, now, I figure if I could stay sober through that, and I did, I can stay sober through anything, and I will. 

I’ve wrestled with alcohol addiction for about 25 years. Longest I was sober was around four years, or so, and then stress came toppling down and I had begun to believe I would be fine if I began to drink again. 

After four years of being sober, the little drunk inside my head was still as cunning, baffling, and powerful as it had ever been, but I let myself get complacent. 

The little drunk demon inside my head has pulled every trick in the book on me at various times throughout my life, so I have no illusions of what I’m up against. I also know, ultimately, I am in this alone, and sometimes I stay sober just to say “Fuck you” to the universe. You won’t take me today. 

Working toward my 60 day chip, now, and I’ll keep going until I collect them all.

When we retire at night, we constructively review our day... On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead... Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 86

I lacked serenity.  With more to do than seemed possible, I fell further behind, no matter how hard I tried.  Worries about things not done yesterday and fear of tomorrow's deadlines denied me the calm I needed to be effective each day.  Before taking Steps Ten and Eleven, I began to read passages like the one cited above.  I tried to focus on God's will, not my problems, and to trust that He would manage my day.  It worked!  Slowly, but it worked!

They rehab followed A.A. and The 12 Steps so over 10 months I learned a lot about the program and also started going to meetings. I put the minimum into the program and was dishonest the who way through. I had no interest towards sobriety and planned to start using again after I got out, which I did. I was relapsed for 5-6 months, got pretty bad and decided to go back to the rooms and get sober. Stayed sober for almost 4 months. Summer hit and once again I relapsed. This time it’s was mostly alcohol which I never really liked or used a lot before. I become very depressed and suicidal almost taking my life around the end of the summer. I think I must have hit a rock bottom cause somehow once again I got sober.

522,"30 years of sobriety for which I am very thankful. 

I work outside the US and just found out my sponsor passed away earlier this year. So this is my tribute to him, I would not be alive today if it had not been for the guidance and dedication of Bill D. He was always there for me. 

I had planned to go back and visit my original home group and see him. It was not uncommon for us to go six months without talking, its just the way we were after so many years. Trying to get in touch was how I found out. 

Leading up to this, I had rehearsed my thank you speech in my mind several times and it always wandered over to how much he had been instrumental in my recovery and it is on that foundation that the success I have had as a person was built. 

The 30 year chip victory lap doesn't seem so appropriate given his passing, so I will allow this to be my thanks to him.

525,"   I've been drinking regularly since before I even hit puberty and have had many high and low points in my life that are directly correlated to drinking.
   Ive always been able to go through stretches completely sober and dont really think anything of it up untill drugs and alcohol are the only things I can think about.
   So when that happens I always endulge. And like that ill be back to drinking. But when this happens its always 50/50 of how hard im going to go with it until my next sober period.
   Sometimes im able to to get buzzed or drunk everyday and know when to stop for the night, and other times it spirals out of control and im putting every drug I can find into my body on top of the alcohol and loosing days at a time without realizing it.
   But even during the worst of it when im forgetting entire days I always show up to work and maintain a steady job, and fulfill any obligations I may have had and continue up keep with my bills and household chores.
   Recently its been weighing heavy on my mind lately cuz I've came along way since my up bringing and dont want to loose everything I've worked for and end up some stereotypical bum on the streets.

I (23F) have known for a long time I have had a drinking problem and have always justified it as … “it is not as bad as that guys” or “it’s not every night”. It isn’t every night.. but it is every other/multiple times a week. 

Addiction runs in my family and was always told to ‘be careful’ with drugs and alcohol because I am statistically more likely to get hooked. These comments were typically followed by an eye roll. Plot twist, I got hooked. 

I am so ready to be done, and have tried multiple times in the past on my own. I am finally ready to start attending meetings and really putting in the work. I want my friends and family to be there to support me but I’m SO ashamed of myself to admit that I have a problem. I also don’t want them worrying about me every time someone at the table orders a drink, or if we go to a concert. 

It’s silly that I am ashamed to want to be better, and I know that but I can’t bring myself to tell them I want and need their help. I have a loving and fantastic support system and no I will be met with love (and lots of worry)!

541,"22 years ago, on October 13th, I walked back into the rooms where I had previously picked up a 2 yr chip and announced myself as a newcomer. Life had gotten hard and I wanted to die. I knew what would make that feeling go away -- a drink. The compulsion came back in a hurry. Half a beer later, and I wanted to quit my job, move to NYC, get whatever work I could, and drink myself to death.

Fortunately, that was just one night and when I sobered up, I realized that I needed to get honest with myself and with this program. See, I'm one of those people that doesn't ever want to be ""the class fuckup"". I was like, if I'm going to be an alcoholic, I'm going to be the best damn alcoholic in AA. I got a sponsor. I did 30 in 30. I worked the steps. I took all kinds of service positions. But, I wasn't being honest with myself and when life got hard, as it does, I picked up a drink.

The second time around, I got a new sponsor. I made a searching and fearless moral inventory. I stopped trying to be a ""good alcoholic"" and got honest with myself and those around me. Part of that was 30 days of raising my hand as a newcomer and then picking up a 30 day chip. That was 22 years ago today.

Since then, both my parents have died. I got married, divorced, and married again. I got laid off, quit jobs, got promoted, got told I ""wasn't meeting expectations"", moved, etc... Life happens, but thank god, I haven't had to pick up a drink to deal with it. I'm so grateful I was able to make my way back to the rooms and that people were there to welcome me.

544,"UNREMITTING INVENTORIES

Continue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear.  When these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them.  We discuss them with someone immediately and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone.  Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The immediate admission of wrong thoughts or actions is a tough task for most human beings, but for recovering alcoholics like me it is difficult because of my propensity toward ego, fear and pride.  The freedom the A.A. program offers me becomes more abundant when, through unremitting inventories of myself, I admit, acknowledge and accept responsibility for my wrong-doing.  It is possible then for me to grow into a deeper and better understanding of humility.  My willingness to admit when the fault is mine facilitates the progression of my growth and helps me to become more understanding and helpful to others.

564,"Cross posed this is another community a few days ago, but want to get some more perspectives from maybe some different people…

I recently found out a friend has been going to a bar 2-4 times a week.  I know that alone this may or may not seem to be significant, but how they are going about this is what is concerning and making me think that they’ve developed a problem.  Or at least are heavily relying on alcohol as a crutch for their problems.  

To start, they lie about what they are doing.  They say they are going out with other friends or spending time with their family, but the only thing they have planned is to end up drinking at their bar of choice.  Note - they found out we knew this was going on so they started going to a different bar.

When they do this they are 100% alone.  They meet no one, but occasionally bring someone they’ve met home for a hookup.  They literally sit at the bar, order drink after drink, scroll their phone, and then drive home.  

They often leave their house late in the evening (9-10PM) and don’t return home from the bar until after 1AM most nights, unfortunately driving themselves home.  And they have to be at work by 9AM most days.

Being honest, I have 0% experience dealing with alcoholism.  I’m guessing most people will not say that any of this is normal?  Does anyone have a similar experience they can share and how they handled it?

567,"CURBING RASHNESS

When we speak or act hastily or rashly, the ability to be fair-minded and tolerant evaporates on the spot.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 91

Being fair-minded and tolerant is a goal toward which I must work daily.  I ask God, as I understand Him, to help me to be loving and tolerant to my loved ones, and to those with whom I am in close contact.  I ask for guidance to curb my speech when I am agitated, and I take a moment to reflect on the emotional upheaval my words may cause, not only to someone else, but also to myself.  Prayer, meditation and inventories are the key to sound thinking and positive action for me.

I love the idea of a self care / inner work routine focused around keeping myself present and mindful around my recovery (emotional sobriety as well.)

- read the just for today and try and meditate on it 
- set my daily positive intentions (can relate to the just for today) and try and schedule my day to minimize potential stress
- journal once a day to take inventory and accountability 
- attend a meeting (in person or via zoom) 
- stay hydrated 
- tell myself out loud or in writing that I’m going to get through the day without relying on unhealthy coping skills (and that I am strong enough to experience whatever discomfort is making me want to rely on them.) 
- pray (in my case, do some sort of mindfulness exercise.)

579,"On Saturday at my home group an old timer with 33 years who I very much admire brought up an issue. He vocalized that he thought our group should rethink closing the meeting with the Lords Prayer. He said that it’s a Christian prayer and has the potential to alienate new comers who might not share that particular faith. I, as a non Christian agree with him 100% although I did not vocalize it at the time. I never recite the Lords Prayer even though my home group closes with it every week. It’s a Catholic prayer and I personally find the Catholic Church to be a corrupt and questionable institution. I wouldn’t  never try and steer someone away from their faith as I believe it is a deeply personal choice. But I agree that AA prayers should be non denominational. The old timer who brought this up was very polite and provided examples of alternatives that are in the big book. The next day I attended another meeting and over heard a group of men saying some pretty vicious things about this guy for merely making a suggestion. A suggestion I quite frankly agree with completely. The guys talking shit are also old timers with lots of sober time under their belts. Guys who I previously looked up too in a lot of ways. I’m torn between feeling like this shouldn’t be such a big deal to me and wanting to speak up about it. I have and always will refuse to recite a Catholic or Christian prayer.

580,"My husband is an alcoholic and has been for years. He is a horrible drinker in the sense of you only get coherent him for an hour max, and then all down hill until he passes out. He’s always been this way and it’s always been irritating to drink around him and embarrassing to drink with him around our friends and family. He is not an angry drunk, or mean or anything like that. He’s just the worst version of himself. He says stupid things that he never would sober, he is outrageously flirty and overly nice in a really uncomfortable way, and his body just gives up on him to the point of his running into walls or his legs giving out when he stands and he drops everything! He’s just a dumb drunk. Anyways, we’ve recognized this as an issue throughout our years together and he’s tried to be sober at least 4 times. We are on the fifth time now, maybe. It is very frustrating for me, because I, of course, want him to get sober, but I am struggling with understanding how he can’t just drink without blacking out every time. I get that a few drinks in and all sense is out the window and that’s why, but it’s so difficult for me to put myself in his shoes and I feel so guilty about it. I am a very easy drinker. I love a few glasses a few nights a week, but I’m extremely functioning and can drink for hours without being even remotely close to his level. Of course I’ve had my nights where I have gone too far, but it’s usually a result of something going on and I went into the situation intended to get more wild than usual. I am being sober along side him to be as supportive as I can be, as I always have been. However, I feel like I am being punished for an issue that I don’t have.

Staying sober the first couple of years is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  It took lots of meetings, sometimes 3 a day, a good sponsor, and working the steps.  I also had to cut things out of my life that made me want to drink.  

I am not a an ideal example of how to work the program.  Sometimes I’ve been an example of what not to do.  I’m glad the program allows for imperfection, as long as we are honest and rigorous.

These days, not drinking is my habit.  Cravings, once always present, are almost nonexistent now, and if they do arise, are easy to dismiss.  However, I never want to let my guard down or forget where I came from.  It was a horrible place, and I never want to return.

I say all this to let you know that if you embrace the program with honesty and a willingness to work, not only is sobriety possible, it can get easier the longer you stick with the program.

My drive to work provides me with an opportunity for self-examination.  One day while making this trip, I began to review my progress in sobriety, and was not happy with what I saw.  I hoped that, as the work day progressed, I would forget these troublesome thoughts, but as one disappointment after another kept coming, my discontent only increased, and the pressures within me kept mounting.  I retreated to an isolated table in the lounge, and asked myself how I could make the most of the rest of the day.  In the past, when things went wrong, I instinctively wanted to fight back.  But during the short time I had been trying to live the A.A. program I had learned to step back and take a look at myself.  I recognized that, although I was not the person I wanted to be, I had learned to not react in my old ways.  Those old patterns of behavior only brought sorrow and hurt, to me and to others.  I returned to my work station, determined to make the day a productive one, thanking God for the chance to make progress that day.

597,"I got my reddit cake day reminder last night. 2 years ago I drunkenly created this user name and reached out here for help. I was told to go to meetings, get a sponsor, work the steps, help others, get involved, among other things.

Since coming back to AA God has done marvelous things in my life. If you don't believe in God we can call it ""Me getting out of the way"". My life is full. I am a loving man. I am useful. If your life is dark and you feel hopeless I plead that you really give AA a shot. Not just an AA sub on reddit, or checking out some zoom meetings- get involved. Get a sponsor, set out chairs, help clean up, give people rides to the meeting, call people, chair meetings, get a home group, get plugged in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I alone am not responsible for these changes....my own experience proved that time and time again. This part of the book is one of the first things I read with my sponsor. He told me I had to stop with the belligerence (fighting to stay sick ""yeah, buts...) and demonstrate some willingness (I was taught that willingness is action. I wanted A LOT of things in my life, but what actions did I actually take to get them?)

&amp;#x200B;

My actual sobriety date is Oct 13. I went to a friends wedding on Oct12 knowing full well I was going to drink. But I also knew the end was near. I was circling the drain. I was beaten down. It was the most miserable night of drinking. I drank not because I wanted to, but because I HAD to. There was no choice. I drank full well knowing that I was done, it was a very strange feeling. The next day I went to a meeting and that's when things began to change. Oh how dark it is before the dawn indeed!

**From The Spiritual Experience:**

**Most of us think this awareness of a Power greater than ourselves is the essence of spiritual experience. Our more religious members call it ""God-consciousness.""**

**Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual principles. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.**

**We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program. WILLINGNESS, HONESTY AND OPEN MINDEDNESS ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF RECOVERY. BUT THESE ARE INDISPENSABLE.**

599,"Title pretty much says it all. I abused psychedelics as a late teen early 20s person. It got bad. I definitely have an addictive element to me. But I also have general life long depression and anxiety and probably some kind of OCD…i do have issues.  

Was I happier when I was 24 in early sobriety living a carefree life in a halfway house surrounded by insane people, constantly socializing? While still half way high from drug use? Sure. That was a like 2006. 

I’m an adult now. All my friends have gotten married, I’m pretty darn isolated, 2020 was very hard on me as I got laid off early pandemic from a real career and didn’t get a real job for about 9 months. I relocated back to my parents and sister’s family area. I have no friends here. 

I thought 2021 would be a big comeback year. Turns out my new job of pretty toxic. I got mono and was really sick from July 3rd through just recently. I’m still freaked out by covid especially after being sick for months and my closest coworker is a covid long hauler and suffering every day. 

And returning ‘home’ as I push 40 years old, single, isolated, I’ve been taking to and seeing my parents a lot. Our relationship has degraded, at times, to points that are very similar to my rough teenage years. Which I totally did not expect. 

They clearly have PTSD from what I put them through. Just being around me so much more and also seeing my increasingly unhappy (sick for months, can’t eat hardly anything, unhappy with work, feel lost) - they are super triggered. They seem to think I’m going to go full alcoholic rapidly or just kill myself or something. This is very much them dredging up feelings from 2005. 

But it’s very confusing to me. I am drinking and smoking pot less now than pretty much any point since I got un sober 10 years ago. My depression level is not crisis level. They just aren’t used to dealing with me regularly and I’m over sharing. 

But they have worked themselves into a nearly panicked state about me and are essentially insisting that I go back to AA if nothing else but for the fellowship. 

I don’t know if I’m very Dry and worse than I realize and they are right, or if this is much more complicated. But if I ignore them I may really damage the relationships so I pretty much have to go to some meetings to try. 

I speak to with a therapist 2x a week and a psychiatrist about quarterly. They see me as not ideal but ok and I just need to do more positive stuff with my life. Though I’m not doing that. I am in a emotional and behavior rut, poor emotional sobriety, but have also just had a really difficult 2 years and lately few months.

611,"I am newly sober currently in treatment. I went to a bunch of different meetings and loved all of them and met a woman at one who invited me to another of her regular meetings. So I went with her but did not like the meeting. It seemed more like a pickup scene to me with everyone very done up and dressed up and what seemed like flirting. I also felt like people were checking me out like people check each other out at a bar or club or party whereas the other meetings I had gone to were very much come-as-you-are, low key, and zero pick-up vibes whatsoever. So that’s my first IS THIS NORMAL question. Was I just in less polished (I don’t know exactly what word to use) kinds of meetings at first or something?

Anyways, someone at the pick-up scene meeting Who knew me very casually saw me and is friends with the woman who invited me there. the pick-up meeting (as I think of it now) is her Home group. I didn’t recognize her because she was dressed up and wearing makeup and had her hair done and I’d never seen her like that before. she invited me to another meeting she goes to so I went with her. 

On the car ride to that meeting she was kind of combative and confrontational about aa and sobriety in general in a way that felt rude and insensitive to me. I’ve been through hell the last few weeks with so many different things and am feeling very beat up already. Her interactions with me left me feeling discouraged and attacked. At the meeting she got upset with another woman and said something pretty sarcastic to her and it made me really uncomfortable. But I still went out to fellowship afterwards with her and enjoyed it except for a few more sarcastic comments that were quite off putting. But I actually found a woman to be my temp sponsor there. That’s my second IS THIS NORMAL for aa question. Are some people just more aggressive about aa and sobriety because they know how serious it is to stay sober? 

Fast forward to today and I asked the first woman I met if she was going to the meeting this week that I met her at originally because I’m planning on going. She said yes and that I should go to fellowship beforehand and I politely declined as I have been running a million miles an hour ever since I got sober almost 3 weeks ago and my treatment counselor has advised me to SLOW DOWN because “recovery isn’t running around like a chicken with your head cut off.” I literally have 3 hours of time before this meeting where I will have to opportunity to sit alone in silence with myself, meditate, rest and chill the fuck out. I can’t remember the last time I’ve done that. She responded telling me I have to go to fellowship because it’s so important in early recovery and asked if It was a money issue? I agree with her on the importance of fellowship and tried to explain how I have not had time to slow down and needed to do that before this meeting and had gone to fellowship after a meeting with the woman we both know and loved it and actually found a sponsor there. She responded with a very short “see you at the meeting”. Wtf? That’s my third  IS THIS NORMAL for aa people question. Now I don’t even want to go to the meeting because I’m afraid she going to try to make me feel bad for not going to the fellowship. 

These two off putting women have been sober for many years so I want to respect them but outside of AA I would nope the hell away from these kinds of people and situations. But I’m also questioning myself in how I’m thinking and feeling about it. Help me try to put this in perspective more.",alcoholicsanonymous,newly sober currently treatment went bunch different meeting loved met woman one invited another regular meeting went like meeting seemed like pickup scene everyone done dressed seemed like flirting also felt like people checking like people check bar club party whereas meeting gone much comeasyouare low key zero pickup vibe whatsoever first normal question le polished know exactly word use kind meeting first something anyways someone pickup scene meeting knew casually saw friend woman invited pickup meeting think home group recognize dressed wearing makeup hair done never seen like invited another meeting go went car ride meeting kind combative confrontational aa sobriety general way felt rude insensitive hell last week many different thing feeling beat already interaction left feeling discouraged attacked meeting got upset another woman said something pretty sarcastic made really uncomfortable still went fellowship afterwards enjoyed except sarcastic comment quite putting actually found woman temp sponsor second normal aa question people aggressive aa sobriety know serious stay sober fast forward today asked first woman met going meeting week met originally planning going said yes go fellowship beforehand politely declined running million mile hour ever since got sober almost 3 week ago treatment counselor advised slow recovery running around like chicken head cut literally 3 hour time meeting opportunity sit alone silence meditate rest chill fuck remember last time done responded telling go fellowship important early recovery asked money issue agree importance fellowship tried explain time slow needed meeting gone fellowship meeting woman know loved actually found sponsor responded short see meeting wtf third normal aa people question even want go meeting afraid going try make feel bad going fellowship two putting woman sober many year want respect outside aa would nope hell away kind people situation also questioning thinking feeling help try put perspective

The location was moved from where it said it was online, so I ended up being like 10 minutes late so I just sat down quietly in the back. About half of the people were ripping vapes the whole meeting and the girl leading it proceeded to belligerently call out everyone who came in late (about 5 people showed up after me saying they also got lost due to the location change). Then she started calling on random people who didnt want to share as it seemed it was their first time trying to force them to talk. She called on my boyfriend who came with me for support and was badgering him to share. He was honest, and said, “at the beginning of the meeting you said not to share if I’m under the influence of mind altering drugs, I smoked weed right before I came here so I don’t think I should.” she said, “no share” and made him. he was too sweet to say he was there for me, so talked when he was really uncomfortable. then there was a guy in recovery from heroine who shared who kept saying the exact location, about 3 times, of where he used to score - “the hotel at the intersection of blank and blank.” is this what a meeting is typically like?

If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 90

What a freedom I felt when this passage was pointed out to me!  Suddenly I saw that I could do something about my anger, I could fix me, instead of trying to fix them.  I believe that there are no exceptions to the axiom.  When I am angry, my anger is always self-centered.  I must keep reminding myself that I am human, that I am doing the best I can, even when that best is sometimes poor.  So I ask God to remove my anger and truly set me free.

640,"Day 2 after three straight years of consistent alcohol abuse and I’ve been drinking everyday for the last 1-2 years. The fact that I am 21 makes me feel like what i’m doing is okay. I see all of my peers around me drinking, why can’t I? Well because I don’t know when to stop and I drink a liter of vodka a day. All i’m craving right now is a liter of vodka to down tonight but i’m pushing through it (barely). I always try to stay sober but haven’t been able to make it to two weeks in years. I just want my passions back, I want myself back. I choose drinking over anything else in my life. I have gained probably 20-30 pounds just from my drinking. Eating healthy and going to the gym is literally my only way out right now. The feeling after a workout and knowing that i’m sober and making progress in my body, mentality, and health is OVERWHELMING and gives me so much dopamine, almost more than alcohol does and it’s absolutely the best. It’s either I am a productive, healthy, motivated human being, or i’m an alcoholic. I’ve tried to find a balance but it’s impossible for me. I HAVE 0 SELF CONTROL. Once I start it just turns into benders. No one else around me really understands how bad it is. Both of my parents are alcoholics so it definitely runs in the family. My boyfriend doesn’t drink at all so that definitely helps but he also doesn’t understand how I feel.. he’s tried to help me multiple times but after seeing me always give up and give into temptation, he has finally stopped and told me I have to do this on my own. I would drink throughout my work day until I fell asleep at night because for some reason the way alcohol makes me feel is better than anything else can, except working out. It’s like I have to be addicted to something and fitness would be my only other addiction. Alcohol has also made me a very aggressive person, attempting to ruin my relationship now and already has ruined one in the past and has also led to me being fired from a job. I know to some people it may seem easy to stay off because of how much bad alcohol does bad for me in the long run and because i’m so in love with working out and eating clean, but i can’t stop myself. I drink to blackout, to where I won’t remember a single thing, to not remember falling asleep, and it’s embarrassing. i want it all to stop, i want to get back into what i loved. I think I now drink because obviously I am obsessed with the feeling, but also because i’m insecure.

651,"A SPIRITUAL AXIOM

It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 90

I never truly understood the Tenth Step's spiritual axiom until I had the following experience.  I was sitting in my bedroom, reading into the wee hours, when suddenly I heard my dogs barking in the back yard.  My neighbors frown on this kind of disturbance so, with mixed feelings of anger and shame, as well as fear of my neighbors' disapproval, I immediately called in my dogs.  Several weeks later the exact situation repeated itself but this time, because I was feeling more at peace with myself, I was able to accept the situation - dogs will bark - and I calmly called in the dogs.  Both incidents taught me that when a person experiences nearly identical events and reacts two different ways, then it is not the event which is of prime importance, but the person's spiritual condition.  Feelings come from inside,not from outward circumstances.  When my spiritual condition is positive, I react positively.

657,"Hello, 
 
So I just wanted to reach out tell my story &amp; offer my services. I do outreach free of charge &amp; help people get into treatment centers all across the US regardless of insurance. I’m just trying to share my story &amp; help people who many be active in addiction, on the fence about what to do with their lives or know someone struggling. You can message me anytime with questions, if you are seeking treatment, treatment for someone else or just want a friend to talk to. I do not charge any money at all. This is just my way of giving back &amp; being altruistic as that is the main thing I try to practice. I welcome anyone to reach out for My email or number. Before you read my story just know you do not need to have an ideal version of God or a higher power or even need to have a faith based program to be in sobriety. Below is my story that I hope will help even just one person.

My name is Alberto I’m a recovering, recovered  heroin addict or whatever terminology you want to use, it does not matter. I’ve been sober since August 13th 2020 &amp; haven’t looked back since. I have had many years on &amp; off in sobriety but this time is when I finally was able to put it all behind me. A little about myself is, since the age of 14 I have struggled with heroin/fentanyl addiction &amp; many other forms of addiction. Heroin was the first substance I ever touched. For nearly 13 years on &amp; off I was heavily in the abyss of addiction &amp; done every single thing in my own way to overcome this disease. 

Of course not a single idea I thought of or plan I conjured up worked. I was a mad scientist trying to bend the rules of addiction to my will but failed each &amp; every time. It was only through acquiring a fellowship, spirituality &amp; finding the similarities that we as addicts/alcoholics share that helped me reach the moment that I know is what people described as when it comes to never wanting to use 
again.

I could talk about all the trauma &amp; pain I went through but none of that matters to me anymore, what matters is what I did with all of that pain. What I did was I was able to mold it with help &amp; was transformed from a victim into a survivor. By really understanding what surrender is, is only when my higher power &amp; others were able to truly help give me the gift of sobriety, but not just sobriety but a life I now cherish. 

Relapsing was more common to me than breathing, if a thought of using came into my head regardless of how much time I had you could bet your life I was going to use. The reason for that is because I never took the time to understand why I use. I would go to meetings, get a sponsor, go through the steps, pray to God &amp; even called people who I thought didn’t care about me but actually did. You never really understand what asking for help is like until you show people your true vulnerability. When I was able to open up to people &amp; God about my pain, trauma &amp; shame amongst the others things we all go through as alcoholics &amp; addicts, is when I was able to understand the difference between being helped &amp; asking for help. 

Being helped means you took the steps regardless of how uncomfortable or how vulnerable you end up. Each layer to my psyche was torn apart, each wall around my heart was broken down, each lie I told was brought to light. It was in these moments with people like yourself reading this that were able to help me understand why I use. I used to escape, I used out of insecurity, I used because I was an empty man with nothing to fill but substances that lasted as quick as they went into me, but with nothing to show for afterwards. After all the work, reaching out &amp; steps I took I was finally able to really feel spiritually fit for the first time. The empty hole in my heart was not filled but mended. It was mended by those regardless of what they went through, how they looked, age, sex or skin all understood the feelings I felt. Ever since I have never felt alone. I was always the kid to be reluctant to give it a shot, my ego was a monster that no man could tame, but God is not a man. 

No matter what you have been through people will always find a reason to help you, you just have to let them. Help is a nice word but the work that it entails is filled with trials &amp; sometimes torment that will bring you to your knees. The only thing that matters is you keep moving forward &amp; persevering. If you ever feel weak do not remember the pain you went through but remember the people who want to help you. Below are some pictures of a pale boy who was lost &amp; almost swallowed up by hell called addiction but now that boy became a man through the help of others who understood what he was going through. I am
Now a man who cherishes life, who yearns to be altruistic &amp; most importantly I smile not to mask emotions I don’t want you to see but because I am generally happy.

661,"Hi everyone, 

As many of us know there has been a brief history of psychedelic substances involved in the early formative years of AA. 
Here is a quick explanation on the correspondence between Bill W and Carl Jung around the usage of psychedelic drugs and twelve step work. 

 “Some of my AA friends and I have taken the material (LSD) frequently and with much benefit,” Wilson told Jung, adding that the powerful psychedelic drug sparks “a great broadening and deepening and heightening of consciousness.” 

Wilson told Jung that his first LSD trip in 1956 reminded him of a mystical revelation he had after hitting bottom in the 1930s and winding up in a New York City hospital ward for hardcore alcoholics. “My original spontaneous spiritual experience of twenty-five years before was enacted with wonderful splendor and conviction,” he wrote. 

LSD was still legal in 1956, and in Wilson’s case initially taken under the medical supervision of UCLA researcher Sidney Cohen, and with the spiritual guidance of his Wilson’s friend, Gerald Heard, an Anglo-Irish mystic and early proponent of psychedelic spirituality. Wilson would go on to quietly form a bi-coastal psychedelic salon with various leading lights of that decade, including the writer Aldous Huxley.

Wilson’s earlier spiritual experience occurred in December of 1934, before LSD was even invented. It happened during Wilson’s fourth and final stay at a private New York City hospital that employed something called the Towns-Lambert Cure to treat their alcoholic clients. Many of these patients, including Wilson, were once-successful businessmen whose drinking had spun out of control during the Great Depression. 

“Suddenly,” Bill would later recall, “my room blazed with an indescribably white light. I was seized with an ecstasy beyond description.”

That room was in a rehab center where doctors employed a potion which included two drugs derived from plants known to cause delirium and hallucinations. One of them is belladonna and the other henbane, was long associated with witchcraft and potions said to summon the spirits of the dead. (Warning to psychonaunts: both of these plants can be poisonous at high doses.) 


Apparently Carl Jung would come to pass before responding to Bills second letter. 


I would never share this in a meeting format but after 8 years of sobriety I developed a severe autoimmune disease and lost the ability to walk- after a few years of trying various mainstream medical treatments with no real progress I turned to alternative treatment methods. One of which was a shamanic ceremony where I ingested the psychedelic drug Iboga.  Afterwards my symptoms subsided nearly 70%. 
This past year I have been able to manage my chronic Lyme inflammation and mobility symptoms with continued micro-dosing of psychedelic drugs. I take micro amounts of psilocybin mushrooms and iboga root 5 days out of the week. 

It’s helped me tremendously in the realm of autoimmunity but I have largely kept my mouth shut about it in twelve step circles. 

At times I have wondered if I am putting my recovery at risk doing this. The truth is that I feel much better physically and mentally when using these medicines. 
My spiritual life and the conscious contact I have with my higher power feels stronger than ever. 
This sort of thing still automatically raises an alarm in my brain and I find myself thinking “I am using a chemical to control how I feel”
And this raises the natural suspicion if what I’m doing is healthy or not.  

I’m not so much interested in anyone’s personal theoretical opinions - but I’ve wondered if anyone out there in 12 step internet land has any actual experience, strength, or hope around the subject.

662,"I’m early into sobriety again and I know statistically speaking, my chances for success increase if I go to meetings and work a program. 

I just can’t get over the cult/religious vibe I get there. Everything is so ritualistic and stiff and it seems like everyone’s high on the Bill W Kool-aid. I enjoy hearing people’s strength and hope and I buy into a lot of the philosophy and steps.

I just disagree with some aspects of the program. But it seems like any deviation from full indoctrination makes me a failure before I’ve began as I’m trying to find “an easier, softer way” and you’re considered non committal by members who’ve been around longer and fully bought in.

I like being independent and autonomous and I can’t help but wonder how much personal growth I’m truly experiencing if I’m just shutting my mouth and nodding my head and living life in a way that’s laid out by something outside of myself.

Is there no gray area?

The sentiment that anyone who is sober but not following the program is secretly miserable and deluding themselves is a big red flag to me. But it’s a prevalent opinion when you walk through those doors.

Anyone whose made it another day sober has accomplished a great feat, whether they did it through there own willpower and determination, found support in family or friends, God or through AA.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 59

I was beginning to approach my new life of sobriety with unaccustomed enthusiasm.  New friends were cropping up and some of my battered friendships had begun to be repaired.  Life was exciting, and I even began to enjoy my work, becoming so bold as to issue a report on the lack of proper care for some of our clients.  One day a co-worker informed me that my boss was really sore because a complaint, submitted over his head, had caused him much discomfort at the hands of his superiors.  I knew that my report had created the problem, and began to feel responsible for my boss's difficulty.  In discussing the affair, my co-worker tried to reassure me that an apology was not necessary, but I soon became convinced that I had to do something, regardless of how it might turn out.  When I approached my boss and owned up to my hand in his difficulties, he was surprised.  But unexpected things came out of our encounter, and my boss and I were able to agree to interact more directly and effectively in the future.

671,"I'm new to reddit too!   I've been aware of this place for some time, I've just never bothered to make an account until recently.  I'm not a very social person, I suffer from terrible anxiety to the point where I'm practically a shut in.  I'm in my early 40s, I've gotten buzzed on weekends for much of my adult life.  I never thought I had a problem, but looking back on it now, I can see it.

My mother was an alcoholic.  I believe that contributed to a lot of her health problems, but we never talked about things like that.  We were bottlers, suppressers.  As a result, I'm avoidant and anxious.  I don't form attachments with people easily, I like being alone.  During the pandemic, with children and husband home a lot, I was never alone and that made my drinking SO much worse.   It almost felt acceptable, you know?  Everyone joked about day drinking so it was easy to hide behind the memes and such.

Anywho... flash forward a bit and I've been sober now for 32 days.  I haven't attended a meeting (shy, anxious), I just wake up every morning and hope for the best.  So far it's been... not easy, but doable.  In recent days I've had some added stress and the temptation is returning.  I think that's why I'm here.  Maybe this will help, maybe in place of meetings I can just anonymously spew my thoughts and worries online and it will be cathartic.

I’m wondering if it’ll be a reoccurring thing, or maybe it’s an underlying issue….to be honest, I don’t know.  The only thing I do know, is I don’t ever want to put myself in a situation to have to go through the things I’ve dealt with this past week. 

I’m making the decision daily to not drink. I still think about it a lot, and suppose I probably always will. But for today, I’m just going to enjoy not feeling run down, or overwhelmed. 

I firmly believe in God, and one verse that stuck out to me is 

Isaiah 5:11 (ESV)
“Woe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening as wine inflames them!”

681,"
So I’m going in my first 74 days of sobriety, I love the aa program and have made some good friends. My first week I started going to aa I had a lady in her 70s come up to me and saw that I was a mess and she offered to be my sponsor. She came up to me and asked if I had one and I said no and she said oh well not anymore, I’m gonna be your sponsor. I thought it was a little strange because I thought we were suppose to ask people but I was grateful that she offered so I can get started on the steps. She was really good, she has 48 years of sobriety and I can tell she knows her stuff, she also has a lot of Sponses. So she gave me a packet to work on and started working the steps. As time went on she would make comments about how being a hair dresser isn’t a “real” career (I’ve been a hair dresser for 10 years now) and gave me tons of shit about smoking a nicotine vape pen as I’m trying to quit smoking cigarettes. I kind blew it off because I know she’s an old timer and just wants what is best for me. But things just started to get worse, if I had to go to a clients hair at their house (I’m just doing it on the side right now because I want to be stable in my recovery before I get a real job) and if I couldn’t make a meeting because of it she said she didn’t want me missing meetings. I currently am going to 4 meetings minimum every week and whenever I miss one I make it up and I’m also in an intense outpatient program on top of that. 
I was suppose to meet at her house a few weeks ago and I was waiting outside her door for almost an hour as she wasn’t answering the door (I confirmed with her the day before) she ended up calling me a few hours later and said she was getting X-rays done at the doctor, I was a little irritated because she didn’t even let me know she was doing that and we confirmed the day before. 
Whenever I talk to her about personal stuff (I’ve had 2 tragic deaths in my life recently and my best friend is currently out using drugs. Also there’s a lot of family drama in my life that I try to stay out of but I’m involved because it is my family) she just tells me it’s none of my business and just to let it go. She also says I need to get over people that died and stuff happens and she’s seen tons of people die and you can’t let it effect you. I understand where she’s coming from as a sponsor but those things are easier said and done. 
I recently went to an nfl football game on Sunday with my boyfriend and his dad. I normally go to a Sunday night meeting but my sponsor doesn’t attend that one. We got stuck in a ton of traffic on the way back from the game and we didn’t get home till late, on the way back she texted me and said she was going to be at that meeting and she’ll see me there. I told her I was stuck in traffic and wouldn’t be going and I had no idea she was even going to go to that meeting. She ignored me and the next day she was upset with me because she said she went to the meeting just for me and didn’t show up. She also questioned why I would even go to a football game during Covid and to never do it again. I explained to her I am vaccinated and I actually had a good time and was proud of myself because it was the first event I’ve gone to sober and didn’t drink. She just kept telling me to not go again. 
I also have been wanting to try an NA meeting that my friends from my out patient group goes too because they are all about my age, but I’m scared to tell her because she thinks alcoholics shouldn’t be going to an NA Meeting and visa versa. 
Long story short, I think I want to change sponsers but I don’t know how to go about it. I feel like if I talk to her about how I feel she’s just gonna get upset because she’s so set in her ways. She is a nice lady but I’m starting to get anxiety whenever I talk to her because I don’t want to say the wrong thing. I don’t want to have to change my home group because of this but but I’m horrible at confrontation. Any advice on how to go about this situation?

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 88

The spiritual axiom referred to in the Tenth Step - 'every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us' - also tells me that there are no exceptions to it.  No matter how unreasonable others may seem, I am responsible for not reacting negatively.  Regardless of what is happening around me I will always have the prerogative, and the responsibility, of choosing what happens within me.  I am the creator of my own reality.  When I take my daily inventory, I know that I must stop judging others.  If I judge others, I am probably judging myself.  Whoever is upsetting me most is my best teacher.  I have much to learn from him or her, and in my heart, I should thank that person.

I went to my first AA meeting last night. I’m 22 years old and was the youngest person there by a long shot. I was coming off of the worst bender of my life that lasted from last Thursday to this Wednesday morning when i laid on my couch in my apartment for 12 hours in a state of complete withdrawal.

I sat in the back for the whole hour and didn’t say a word. I really wanted to speak up but i was barely holding myself together and i knew that i would start balling my eyes out if i even tried to start talking. I know not sharing at meetings is okay, but i could tell that most of the people there could tell i was a newbie and wanted me to say something, but they weren’t about to make me uncomfortable or anything, which i appreciated.

I’ve always been the person in my friend groups that gets the most fucked up, incoherent, and does some of the worst shit a person can do while fucked up. I’m embarrassed to say that i really can’t remember a single minute of Monday-Tuesday.. I’m a college student in my last semester and i didn’t go to class or work either of those days because for some reason i decided what was best for me was to keep the bender going and i just sat on my couch drinking a fifth of Jaeger.

I come from a long line of good people that are really bad alcoholics, on both sides of my family and i really feel like i have disappointed them tremendously.

This 4-5 day period in which i was fucked up almost nonstop wasn’t the first such occasion that I’ve done that, but i do believe it was the worst and the longest and i don’t ever want to go through the hell of what i did Wednesday morning as well as the shame and embarrassment of my actions for myself and my family.

693,"Hey guys,

I’m 23 years old. I usually have 2 or 3 drinks before bed every night. This isn’t usually enough to make me hungover, but I have tend to drink pretty heavily on the weekends. I get terrible anxiety when I’m hungover. No headaches, just random panic attacks about absolutely nothing.

I drank heavily Wednesday through Sunday last week(which isn’t typical for me). Monday morning I had to pull over 3 separate times during a 45 minute drive due to my anxiety. I haven’t taken a sip of alcohol in 72 hours, but still had panic attacks frequently yesterday/today, and have only gotten about 8 hours of sleep total the past two nights, so I believe these are alcohol withdrawals.

I’ve accepted that I need to slow down on my drinking and have proven to myself the past few days that I’m capable of doing it. My question to you guys is this: Let’s say the withdrawal symptoms are gone on Friday. If I drink on Saturday (not heavily of course), will the withdrawals come right back the next morning, or would I have a clean slate to work with?

701,"Hey everyone,

When I was a teenager/young adult I had some pretty severe alcohol/drug abuse problems. I never wanted to label myself an addict, but I did eventually get sober after hitting rock bottom. Then I improved my life and got started on a career years later.

I still drank though. It took a lot of practice, but I switched to beer instead of liquor. And most of the time, I was too busy to drink. At most, I would go out binge drinking once a week while in college. And yes, I was disappointed in myself that I still had little self control when going out with friends.

Fast forward to today, I am fresh out of a divorce, have little connection to my family, and it's getting too late for me to ever have my own kids one day. I have a hard time imagining myself in another relationship because I always choose abusive men. So it's really not worth it. And now I have nothing to live for. 

I have been drinking everyday, getting shitfaced every weekend night. I love it when people cancel their plans on me so I can just drink in private instread.

But I had a stern talking too by my friend. Saying I need therapy, and I agreed I would go. But I kind of don't want to. I already know that I will go and they'll tell me to stop drinking. And I don't want to. What then?

711," Hello.

I'm an alcoholic who previously had been to a detox center. This has been probably 2-3 years now. Since then, I do okay. I don't know that I'm your typical AA alcoholic, as I managed to get into social drinking in the last year or two and seemed to be relatively okay. After getting out of the detox center, I stayed away for quite sometime, and then found myself occasionally going out and getting plastered. This would happen maybe once every month. Since then, I cleaned that up quite a bit, drink maybe 1-2 times a month (and not much at all). I also go to the gym and practice fitness and healthy eating.

I really thought I had it all turned around.

Last Thursday, I was in a wedding, and I drank with the wedding party and had maybe 6-7. Felt fine but hungover the next day. Friday, I drank at the wedding as well. I really screwed up - I'm certain I had over 16 drinks (spirits) to myself, which implies a 750ml bottle of liquor or more. I also woke up the next morning and drank 3 more, purely for the pain. I haven't drank since, so today is day 4 with no alcohol and no intention of continuing. I didn't eat at all Saturday and Sunday, and have been doing my best with water intake daily since but it's been averaging around 80oz. per day, and I'm 190lbs and usually drink around 120oz. of water. I started going back to the gym on Monday.

This is the second time this has happened this year, and the last time it did, it was only one night, I was hungover for at least 7 days. It is the same this time too, however in looking up symptoms like tingling arms, and just general flu-like symptoms I came across alcoholic neuropathy. Right now, I have a slight tingling in my arms and just some brain fog and some tremors. If I remember right, the only other time this happened this year, it went away after 5-7 days. I did not know about AN at that time, and I'm now afraid I've caused myself an issue and am worried that I should seek medical attention.

In regard to my habits, I had everyone convinced (including myself) that I was no longer a problem. So much for that huh? Luckily, since I got out of detox I have developed a habit of being able to not drink, so as long as I don't attend the wrong events, I won't drink by myself, or at home or anything like that. So moving forward from here won't be difficult, as I typically don't even have cravings or urges. I just wrongly convinced myself that I was able to handle something I'm not, and instead of manifesting itself in daily drinking, it all came out in a 48hr period.

Let me know what you think, I'm really nervous about this.",alcoholicsanonymous, hello im alcoholic previously detox center probably 23 year since okay dont know im typical aa alcoholic managed get social drinking last year two seemed relatively okay getting detox center stayed away quite sometime found occasionally going getting plastered would happen maybe every month since cleaned quite bit drink maybe 12 time month much also go gym practice fitness healthy eating really thought turned around last thursday wedding drank wedding party maybe 67 felt fine hungover next day friday drank wedding well really screwed im certain 16 drink spirit implies 750ml bottle liquor also woke next morning drank 3 purely pain havent drank since today day 4 alcohol intention continuing didnt eat saturday sunday best water intake daily since averaging around 80oz per day im 190lbs usually drink around 120oz water started going back gym monday second time happened year last time one night hungover least 7 day time however looking symptom like tingling arm general flulike symptom came across alcoholic neuropathy right slight tingling arm brain fog tremor remember right time happened year went away 57 day know time im afraid ive caused issue worried seek medical attention regard habit everyone convinced including longer problem much huh luckily since got detox developed habit able drink long dont attend wrong event wont drink home anything like moving forward wont difficult typically dont even craving urge wrongly convinced able handle something im instead manifesting daily drinking came 48hr period let know think im really nervous

How often I avoided a task in my drinking days just because it appeared so large!  Is it any wonder, even if I have been sober for some time, that I will act that same way when faced with what appears to be a monumental job, such as a searching and fearless moral inventory of myself?  What I discover after I have arrived at the other side - when my inventory is completed - is that the illusion was greater than the reality.  The fear of facing myself kept me at a standstill and, until I became willing to put pencil to paper, I was arresting my growth based on an intangible.

In all the research I did, it said direct amends are best unless it hurts the person you’re making amends to. It would not hurt us at all, she knows it, and we were looking forward to finally having an honest conversation with her. She definitely knows that amends are needed at the very least to the kids that she abandoned due to her addiction.

My love for alcohol for me and my friends started in high school and continues to this day. I am not a daily drinker but a binge drinker every week from thurs to sat and then I am sober from sun to thurs.. This is process that has been on repeat for almost 30 yrs.. As I mentioned,  I consider myself functioning because 1) I have held a job since the day i left high school, moved up within the industry and continue to be successful, 2) feel I am a good father to the two children I have and 3) have a solid marriage w/ a wife that is my best friend .. I have always been a happy drunk but I am a blackout drunk..I mostly drink alone but I also rely on it heavily in social settings. I have dealt with anxiety for yrs which I always thought was relieved by my drinking however I understand that my vicious cycle is the culprit of the anxiety/depression.. About 1 yr ago I decided to sober up for a while just because (not call it quits, that was never the intention).. It lasted a surprising 75 days and then I celebrated with drinking.. I then adjusted my cycle to drinking once every 2 weeks foe a bit but it wasnt long before I was back to my usual 3 days on 4 days off binge (15 to 20 beers a night) cycle. This is what i became to know and love..Recovering Sum to Wed and back at it come Thurs (it cant come soon enough)

What I know is that 75 days was the best I  have ever felt in my life.. During that 75 days, I was exceeding expectations at work, being a more ""present"" father and husband to my wife and kids.. Anxiety and depression had vanished.. Looking back I should have kept going. 

I recently told my wife that I'm going to make another run at drying out with the goal in mind to beat my 75 days. Today is day 24 and I already feel so much anxiety relief and clarity. Even though I said I was going to dry up with a goal of &gt; 75 days, I since internally decided I am going for permanent sobriety. It doesn't make any sense to go back to my repetitive unhealthy lifestyle.. I feel I have a second chance at life to figure out who I really am and what I can be without the sauce in my life.

I’m in a cycle of drinking because of anxiety or because of messing up caused by drinking, so then I drink more and feel horrible all over again. 

I have tried therapy and for anxiety and depression and tbh alcohol just works better for me, or at least I feel more relief even if it is short lived. 

I’ve lived my life messing up the personal part of it (no close friends) — blacking out and saying things and having no idea why people hate me. Blacking out and doing embarrassing things. 

Today I am in trouble because of someone else’s excessive drinking and my failure to act professionally when I should have. Despite all of my drinking mistakes I have never gotten in trouble or messed anything up at work. 

My boss wants to talk to me tomorrow and I am terrified. I’ve never been in trouble at work. It’s all I had going for me. I don’t know if I can handle it and it feels like the end of the world. 

I know I have a bad relationship with alcohol but it’s someone else’s alcohol mistake I’m paying for now — it makes me wonder if this would have happened if I had not had 2 beers myself. It makes me wonder if I need to stop or if I am managing/doing ok.

726,"
I had 2 DWI’s by the time I was 22. Rehab like 3x, court cases 2x, probation, the works. During most of that, not a bone in my body wanted to quit drinking beers.

From Early 2018-Summer 2020 I had 900ish days alcohol free, the last 250-400  or so of those days were drug fueled pure insanity. A girl I grew up with died in a terror attack in Sri Lanka, a few other neighborhood kids died, my best friend died of an overdose, then another girl from school, same thing a month or so later. 

I had already given up caring while not drinking, pre meditated relapse, textbook. At first I hit as many meetings as possible, was riding a pink cloud, it felt great. Then I pretty much figured I was better than anyone else who struggled with drinking, and nobody could school me. 

The end result was seas of rage and insanity honestly worse than any hangover or guilt related to drinking or really anything. It was the worst most uncomfortable irritating daily feeling I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy.

Throughout my drinking this year I feared more legal trouble, and tried several times to clean up to no avail. A week here and there, a month tops. More recently came within hairs of catching an assault after a blackout bar brawl I have 0 recollection of. 

I don’t want to say “by the grace of god” ‘cause the only certain thing I know about God is it’s just the word Dog spelled backwards. 
But by the grace of god, someone looked out for me and no charges were pressed.

I knew it was time to go back to AA. As much as it sucks balls throwing in the towel, admitting as a man I need help, and not being able to go party *the bars suck these days anyway, 0 females out on weekends (all at home watching tv due to covid)
I always just wanted some peace of mind. I knew deep down a lot of people who use AA to make it work for them have peace of mind, so I guess i’m just tired of running and ready to give myself to this shit.",alcoholicsanonymous, 2 dwi time 22 rehab like 3x court case 2x probation work bone body wanted quit drinking beer early 2018summer 2020 900ish day alcohol free last 250400 day drug fueled pure insanity girl grew died terror attack sri lanka neighborhood kid died best friend died overdose another girl school thing month later already given caring drinking pre meditated relapse textbook first hit many meeting possible riding pink cloud felt great pretty much figured better anyone else struggled drinking nobody could school end result sea rage insanity honestly worse hangover guilt related drinking really anything worst uncomfortable irritating daily feeling wish upon worst enemy throughout drinking year feared legal trouble tried several time clean avail week month top recently came within hair catching assault blackout bar brawl 0 recollection want say grace god cause certain thing know god word dog spelled backwards grace god someone looked charge pressed knew time go back aa much suck ball throwing towel admitting man need help able go party bar suck day anyway 0 female weekend home watching tv due covid always wanted peace mind knew deep lot people use aa make work peace mind guess tired running ready give shit

I’ve been very blessed as of late to have started having regular meetings with other women in recovery through my work at a SAP program that previously did not offer AA. The question of whether or not to register the meetings has come up since they’ve become something of regular programming. While I was reasonably active in A.A. Throughout my own recovery and continue to be, I’ve never ventured into service work on a group level before, and thanks to COVID my home group no longer meets very regularly, so I’m sort of directionless with anything on the scale of organizing the formalities.

733,"Today I hit one year sober. I'm 20, part of me feels like it's pathetic that at 20 years old I'm already one year sober. That at so young I had a problem and had to choose sobriety if I wanted to survive. In September of 2020 I got black out drunk and fought cops, that was my rock bottom. I knew something had to change. From the second I turned 18 to that point at 19 I was essentially drunk every night. If I couldn't hide the night drinking I'd day drink and walk around. I functioned. I could function, but without the promise of alcohol I felt there was no reason to live. When I hit my rock bottom I met a paramedic who changed my life and perspective on things. He showed me there was more to life then getting shit faced. I had my last hoorah on October 5, 2020, of course it was day drinking. Well morning drinking. I got plastered on the steps of the courthouse. I'm missing most of that day, but I remember sobering up at McDonald's. At roughly 5:45pm I was sober. I promised myself when I started drinking that day to only have enough to enjoy. That's the last time I got drunk or even had a drop of alcohol. It's 6:30pm October 5, 2021 and I am proud to say I am 1 year sober. One whole year sober. I'll be honest I didn't think it was possible. It still scares me, what if I relapse after getting this far? What if I fail everyone? It's scary, but at least I can say is that in this moment I did it. Now I KNOW I can do it. I hope I don't slip, but it's one day at a time.

735,"I stayed up all night drinking again. At 5am I finally searched for AA meetings near me. I’m super sporadic and chaotic when I’m drinking so I left the house even though it didn’t start for another 2 and a half hours. I hit the gas station and bought a tall boy. Turns out the meeting didn’t start until 9am. To kill time I went to my sister-in-law’s place and helped her take her son to school. Thank GOD she was awake. She actually ended up going to the meeting with me! When we got there it was exactly what I remembered from when I was 13 in rehab being forced to attend AA. A bunch of old geezers who all knew each other… but this time I was there by choice and everyone was soooo kind and welcoming. Meeting one of the women was really special for me. In minutes of meeting each other she was hugging me and I just broke down in tears. I guess because I felt hopeful for once. I know the meetings alone do not keep you sober but for once I finally felt like I had the ability to let go of this chain on my life. Everyone at that meeting this morning read passages that stuck with both my sister in law and me. They didn’t urge us to think of recovery with God in a religious way and that’s great because we’re very spiritual in a different way. I was white faced, emotional, hadn’t slept in 24 hours, drunk as piss, head throbbing, and I look over at my sister and see her wiping tears and knew that we were both meant to be there today. I’m happy I made this choice, and when I came home my husband told me how proud he was of me. Here’s to about 6 hours sober!!! I hope there’s many more to come. What I’m telling myself right now is that even though I see literally everyone relapse at some point, I can’t use that as an excuse to drink again. Like “oh it’s okay I can drink tonight and start my journey again tomorrow…” because I really have that tendency to give myself any excuse to drink. Hell, I’ll drink to not drinking! So stupid. So right now I’m working on deciding if I should cancel upcoming parties I’m hosting and events I’m going to because alcohol is everywhere in my life. I’m not sure if being around it right now is a good idea even though I’d like to think I could resist. I’ve also been reminding myself that I hate who I am when I drink.

739,"Hello everyone :)


I posted here a couple of days ago and everyone was extremely kind and generous with advice, thank you so much. I’m hoping for a couple of further tips please if anyone has any.


My mental health team who I have been under the care of for one year (major depression and suicide attempt) have referred me today to the substance abuse/alcoholism team. Apparently it will take about 2-3 weeks for them to get in touch. 


I asked about attending AA meetings but for now they have advised to try their professionals first. I have not ruled out AA and still very open to attending in future. For now, I am looking for some tips for how to get to at least one day of sobriety? In the past I had reasons not to drink (although that hasn’t always been enough to stop me) because the next day I needed to work, exercise class etc. But these days depression has wiped my motivation, I’m out of work, I basically lie in bed as much as possible which I am not proud of. Drinking is about the only thing I look forward to. I feel if I can crack one day of not drinking here and there, it will be easier for me to be productive on and off over the coming weeks.


I am supposed to be studying for the last year of my degree as a mature student which started on Saturday. But I haven’t even looked at it. It is flexible learning so I don’t have a fixed schedule unlike a traditional university. This is something that should be motivating me to get sober but isn’t.


Essentially, I am looking for tips as to how to beat the craving. Today I promised myself I would not drink, but once evening came around again, I did it. How to combat these cravings? I have heard of “surf the urge” but I always automatically dismiss it in my head. I was planning to distract myself tonight by watching a TV show but the temptation was too great.

740,"Hello y'all, ill keep it short.

My roommate hit 1 year sober through AA about 2 months ago. He seems to have subbed seltzer water in for beers and it works for him from what I can see. I think it is worth noting that I sometimes have beer in the house and I made triply sure he was cool with it. (I have a deal with him to put a mini fridge in my room, or not to have any, if it truly became a problem, no questions asked. So far so good ~5 months)


He recently asked me if I was doing no booze October, which I am. He showed me a pic of some brewery that puts out a non alcoholic IPA and to see if our local place had it next time i went. I immediately got a sinking feeling in my stomach, imagining this is probably nothing but bad news. Although I have had some struggles with alcohol, I've never needed rehab or to permanently abstain. I can't imagine that if it came to that point, I would want to have near beers around me.


He's a grown man, so I don't want to impose on him by telling him to ask his sponsor first, I'm genuinely not sure how that works. So I'm asking you guys, should I pretend to have forgotten and hope he does too? Or should I get them for him?

... we know that the pains of drinking had to come before sobriety, and emotional turmoil before serenity.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 94

I love spending time in my garden feeding and pruning my beautiful flowers.  One day, as I was busily snipping away, a neighbor stopped by.  She commented, 'Oh!  Your plants are so beautiful, it seems such a shame to cut them back.'  I replied, 'I know how you feel, but the excess must be removed so they can grow stronger and healthier.'  Later I thought that perhaps my plants feel pain, but God and I know it's part of the plan and I've seen the results.  I was quickly reminded of my precious A.A. program and how we all grow through pain.  I ask God to prune me when it's time, so I can grow.

781,"After working the steps and getting honest for the first time ever, I realized that I used medical professionals to justify my drinking / drug abuse. Basically the epitome of the ""if you had my life, you would drink like I drink "" syndrome. 

I had an alcoholic father that was the kind to tell my mother that if she left him, he'd kill all of us. So we ran around the country hiding during my childhood.  New schools every few months because he would find us, etc. I saw a lot of violence blah blah. So my mom tried her best to help me and had me seeing counselors really young. 

I learned right away these counselors show sympathy for you when you tell them things.  They told me I've seen too much. That im traumatized. That im different than normal healthy kids and im going to need ongoing treatment, likely forever. As I grew up, I was diagnosed with more and more. PTSD, bi-polar disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and panic attacks. They even told me that I had a chemical imbalance. That i lacked the natural ""feel good"" chemicals normal people have... And I was prescribed more and more. 

People with fancy degrees assuring me that I have valid medical and psychological issues requiring chemical treatment. Shit... Thats all you had to say!

Of course if I have to be medicated to live through all my mental issues and chemical imbalances, I may as well be the one to choose which meds make me feel better. The ones they prescribed really never did much for me. After much experimentation, I settled on liquor being the most effective chemical solution.  It was the only thing that worked AND it was all natural, legal, easy to get, and didn't require a prescription and dependence on the medical industrial complex. Win-win.

Then I drank to a point of dependency where when they separated me from liquor, I had a seizure, respiratory failure, delirium tremens, and had to use a walker to learn to walk again.  Liquor quit working and I was out of options. The plan was to go to AA a bit to show my family that I at least tried something before drinking myself to death.

A little over a year sober and I recently got to step 12 with my sponsor. I finally got honest. Im not crazy. Im just a drunk! I don't have PTSD, just been through a bit more drama than some.  Drama, not trauma!  I needed a spiritual solution, not a chemical solution this whole time.

793,"Hi, I consider myself a ‘problem drinker’, but not sure if it means I’m an alcoholic as such? I’ve always used alcohol as a crutch, in an unhealthy way. At one time when I was younger I used to drink all day including before and during work, to combat social anxiety. Over the years I’ve noticed that I drink more than my peers and in bad times, drink quite a lot, most nights of the week. But then again there have been months and years where I’ve not been a problem drinker at all, drinking similar amounts as others or much less, and only at weekends. 


Over the past year I’ve been drinking a lot at weekends, sometimes everyday, getting drunk in the early evening and my family have expressed concern. After that happened I did manage to reduce it to about 3-4 times per week and drinking a bit less. But over the last couple of months I’ve been drinking every day (with a few days off in the last couple of weeks). I’m out of work at the moment so no routine or motivation not to drink. About a bottle of wine and a half each evening. It’s not huge amounts but I don’t think it’s healthy and it is effecting me the next day, eg super hangover. I don’t have the shakes or anything like that and I don’t believe any kind of physical addiction. Would you say I’m an alcoholic?


Also, I am currently under psychiatric support for major depression and suicide attempt. I see a professional once a week to discuss my treatment and progress. A number of times over the past year they have asked if I’d like to be referred to the alcohol support workers. I’ve always declined as I’ve not felt I’m at that point and also feel a bit embarrassed seeking alcohol support when I’m only drinking a bottle and a half of wine a night. I know some people can drink a lot throughout the day so would feel like I was wasting the professionals time who could be helping others who are having a tougher time. Do you think I should be referred?

796,"I hit one year sober this week. Felt like a big build up to that day, and then it was done. I’m not sure if it was the milestone, the change in weather but the evenings are really feeling very touch and go. The dark evenings, the longer nights at home. I’m not sure. I know I’m always one drink away from rock bottom.

A month after I got sober I fell pregnant. I now have a 12 week old. My year of sobriety almost feels like I cheated.. because I wouldn’t have drank pregnant, and didn’t with my first born. It feels almost like in reality it’s only four months sober.

Anyway, I’m not sure if this is a rant.. I’m not struggling. But more there is a niggling and a sense of a craving that I can’t satisfy with chocolate or cigarettes right now. Thought it good to write it out.

797,"So, I’m hitting 60 days sober today. It’s my third time around, planning on it being my last. Anyone find it hard to adjust to life without alcohol? I have mental health issues, anxiety/depression and sometimes miss the oblivion that alcohol provided. Knowing that it took entirely more from me than just a mental break, I know that the escapism is not rational. I have been coping well, with not very many problems involving cravings, but it sucks when friends leave you out so that they can go drink. It’s always used as an excuse, when it doesn’t make any sense in my case, as I work at a bar (and can comfortably be around alcohol and not feel tempted).

803,"Content warning for obvious reasons including relapse, bodily harm, and fire. Someone I know from the program relapsed and while they were high not long ago they set themself on fire accidentally. They burned their entire face, part of their arm, and their hand. I guess they were setting something on fire and accidentally switched up their lighter fluid container with a container of gasoline ( ??!!!?!) and they caught fire. They could’ve died. Their face looked terribly injured obviously. They have gone through several procedures like skin grafts already and their injuries and appearance have come a long way, but they do not look the same and I can’t imagine they will ever really look like what they did before setting themself on fire. I will say they look the best I’ve ever seen someone with that intense of facial burns look after reconstructive surgery or whatever procedures were done, so they are lucky for that and that they are safe and didn’t die. Still, of course no one wants to go through that and that’s got to be a horrifically traumatic thing to go through and live with for the rest of your life. This is what relapse looks like though. This could be any of us if we don’t get and stay sober.

Things don’t stay like they were the last time you drank or used. They don’t get better. It’s not chill. They always get worse, and usually they get worse much faster than the time before. Alcoholics and addicts cannot learn to use or drink in a normal, social, safe way. We cannot. I’ve tested it and failed. The first time I got sober I thought maybe I wasn’t realllyyyyy an alcoholic because I hadn’t gone to jail, ruined a marriage, lost a career, etc. I went back out and then guess what happened? I ended up going to jail 3 separate times when I was 21 because I got 2 duis a couple months apart. I was lucky I didn’t hurt somebody else or myself or crash. I’m sure that would’ve been in my not so distant future had I not been stripped of my ability to drive then gotten sober. I’ve been sober thanks to my higher power, my people, and this program for 5 years. You all can do it, too. Really, if I can, you can, too. I was fucked. There’s plenty of times I could’ve died. 

Back to the person with burn accident. They’ve got several kids. What’s next after you burn your fucking face off? When is it enough? Now the hospital is giving them heavy drugs for their pain, which I’m sure they honestly need right now, but will this be their wakeup call? I know them pretty well, and sadly I don’t think so. It *might* be one of the many wakeup calls they’ve had through the years where they try again for a bit and then relapse again in a few months or a year. I kind of doubt they aren’t driving their kids around while they’re high. Will they get into a wreck while high with their kids in the car? I sure as fuck hope not, but these are the thoughts and worries you have about someone when they’re already at the point where they’ve accidentally burned their face off while high. 

They are a person who has probably been to rehab about 7 times at this point over more than a decade I’m pretty sure. I used to be their sponsor, so I know what they’re like and why they haven’t stayed sober. They made excuses all the time from the very beginning on why they can’t do 90 meetings in 90 days for example. They didn’t give their all and put their heart and soul into their steps. They’re a bullshitter. They lash out and cast people out of their lives when they try to tell them the truth for their own good. They surround themselves with yes men who oftentimes use them. They are not rigorously honest. They seem so self-deluded that they believe their own lies even when they’re sober and of course more when they’re not sober I’m sure. They’ve lost custody of their kids before. And those kids are fucking awesome. This person is also fucking awesome when they want to be and are fully capable of succeeding, being a great parent, and going on to help other people and live a good life, but they have not done the things they need to do to stay sober. Don’t take that path. I beg you. It breaks my fucking heart.

I’m not sharing this to shame anyone or any actions. I know this is a horrible and debilitating disease and I made my fair share of awful decisions that hurt myself and others before I got sober. Hell, I’ve done some dumbass shit in sobriety, too, but I have kept moving forward and growing and doing the shit I need to do to stay sober and make progress. This is seriously a simple program. Yes, it can be hard as hell sometimes, but if you make excuses and don’t keep going, you will pay the price and so will the people who love you. I just wanted to share this because this news has shaken me to my core, and it has reminded me of the reality of this disease and made me even more grateful to still be sober. The tragedies we and others go through are awful, but they are the truth of the disease of alcoholism and addiction and we have to remember that. Let them be a lesson and a time to check in with ourselves and be grateful for what we have. 

TLDR: Someone I know relapsed and accidentally set themself on fire while high and burned their entire face. They could’ve died. They’re an awesome person when they want to be when they’re sober, but they are a chronic relapsed because they don’t do the work to stay sober. This could be me or any of us if we relapsed. The consequences of this disease are absolutely brutal and just get worse and worse each time we relapse or the longer we keep drinking. Please do what you need to do, because you can get and stay sober. I’ve been sober 5 years. Pretty much anyone can do it if they work the program.

Someone who knew what he was talking about once remarked that pain was the touchstone of all spiritual progress.  How heartily we A.A.'s can agree with him...

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 93-94

When on the roller coaster of emotional turmoil, I remember that growth is often painful.  My evolution in the A.A. program has taught me that I must experience the inner change, however painful, that eventually guides me from selfishness to selflessness.  If I am to have serenity, I must STEP my way past emotional turmoil and its subsequent hangover, and be grateful for continuing spiritual progress.

808,"I have 14 months of sobriety. 

I just found out the my SO of 9 years was having an affair.  I don't know for how long or how many people.  I guess it doesn't matter.  I kicked her out 26 days ago.  We have a daughter together (6 yo).  

I'm having trouble working my program into this shit hurricane.  I know the book says that acceptance is the key.   I'm working on accepting that this happened.  

I don't know how to treat my ex now.  A lot of infidelity material that i've read suggests using ""justifiable anger"" to fuel getting through this and make myself a better person, and make a better life.  But the BB says that anger is the luxury of normal men.  And justifiable resentments are probably the most dangerous. 

I don't feel like drinking over this.  I want to do the next right thing so I can make it out of this happy, and keep my daughter happy and protected.  

""We realized that the people who wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick. Though we did not like their symptoms and the way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too. We asked God to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend. When a person offended we said to ourselves, “This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be done.”

I am having a hell of a time balancing boundaries/not taking any more bullshit with the 'tolerance, pity and patience' part.  She's already sleeping with other men, and then texts me the next day that she misses me.

I find that I have an ever increasing connection to my higher power (I use Nature or the Spirit of the Universe and say God for ease).

Is it possible that I have become addicted to the pleasant feelings of serenity that I get through prayer and meditation? Does this thought make any dang sense?

I rarely drink alcohol, but when I do, it's mostly a lot (like on parties etc.). A year ago I had a very bad night on a party, where I can't remember to much. I was talking lots of stuff that didn't make any sense and I was acting really strange, according to the people who were with me.

Almost the same happened last night. I was partying after the clubs just opened again. In my memory I got in trouble with some people and was followed by these as well. I called my mother out of fear and after I sobered up, she told me that I was talking a lot of nonsense.

I am not sure what exactly happened and what this could be, but after looking through the internet, I stumbled over the so called ""alcohol psychosis"".

819,"I did quit AA once, right at 50 weeks sober.   I was really working the program during that time, taking it seriously.  Working the steps with my sponsor, leading meetings, listening to audiobooks, etc.  But I was missing something from Step 1.  I was willing to admit my life had become unmanageable, but I had doubts about being ""powerless over alcohol.""  I thought I could go back to it and it would be fun for the holidays.  

What ensured once I picked up the drink again was nothing but pain and remorse.  From the very first night to 65 days later when I nearly died.  Then I became convinced that I was powerless over drinking and I got the impression the Universe was making sure I had no mistakes about it!   During that time,  I wrote down everything that went wrong it was 3 pages of negative things and disasters.  Starting with my son crying because I did not get the 52-week chip!

I feel a loss when people tell me they did AA for *x* months to a year and quit going to meetings because they don't drink anymore.  They believe they're all better.  I know what that feels like, but the truth is recovery takes time.  For me I had to **learn to live my life sober,** to beat back the anxieties of life.  To finally be able to sit quietly with me without reaching for a drink or a drug or some other addictive filler (shopping, eating, obsessive behaviors, overfocusing on things, too much work, too much exercise).  For me, there is a second part of the AA program where my life got immensely better.  The barbaric behavior went away and I started looking after others.

Anxiety and malaligned behaviors were my biggest challenge.  Next year will be 3 years sober before the incident(s).  This whole past year has been filled with an intuition that only the Universe could provide.  I reclaimed my career after two years of searching.  My immediate family doesn't drink anymore because of what happened.  I'm helping my sister get sober.  I amended relationships and those people went off to mend ties with their old friends.  It's been the *AA Promises*

832,"I finally came to a realization that I am an alcoholic. It all started 3 years ago… I was what you can call a high functioning alcoholic. I fell into a deep depression after having my last child. My last two are only 17 months apart and being the only one to care for them really took a toll on me mentally. And so I turned to drinking in the shadows. I had bottles hidden in the apt, my car. In random cups to disguise that I was drinking. No one really knew because I still handled tasks in my day to day life. Over the course of the years I was drinking on and off. Was able to quit for 5 months last year while quitting with my then boyfriend but eventually with our break up, life stresses and chaos I picked up that bottle again. Living on my own it became even worse because I sat alone in my thoughts and I lost the will power to stay focused in workouts and I let alcohol consume me and ruin my friendships, my family, my work and my relationship. My life became unmanageable. I moved out of state 2 months ago and being away from all my family took a toll on me daily. There came the alcohol, the only thing to comfort and numb me in the shadows. I isolated myself to my room and drank every night and day letting depression and anxiety keep me down. I let alcohol once again take control of me whether I was alone or surrounded by my kids. I had the desire to quit, I was missing out on so much in life including being present in my children’s. I mentioned it to my family that I wanted to quit. Earlier this week I came out of work to a letter from my son with a picture of my kids. In the letter he’s talking about how he and his siblings are there for me and how proud he is of me for making the decision to move here, for all my hard work at work and at home and for the then 3 days I didn’t have a drink. It was his letter and appreciation and acknowledgment of my efforts that helped me walk through the doors of my first AA meeting yesterday. It was the best thing I could’ve done. I felt welcomed and my heart at peace to hear everyone else share their stories and to be able to relate to each person. One person said… we are here to help you on your journey, only you can love and help yourself first and if you don’t love yourself, we will all love you and be here for you to support you until you learn to. I received my first sobriety chip and it was the best feeling in the world. I have now made it through one week and have been to 2 AA meetings. A woman I met who is 6 years sober has been texting me to encourage the meetings and has been nothing but great support. I have not yet found a sponsor but that will be my next step. Grateful for the fellowship of my new found AA family. My heart &amp; soul feel at peace and I finally feel like I’m on the right path. Good luck to anyone who struggles.

833,"I’ve never had trouble staying away from alcohol for long periods of time, but when I do drink I majorly over do it which is why I consider myself to be an alcoholic. I’ve made the decision not to drink anymore at all. 

I’ve decided to work through the steps with a therapist instead of going to meetings because I have extreme social anxiety and after going to meetings I don’t think it will work for me.

837,"Today I have five months sober from alcohol and benzodiazepenes.

 Here is a little back story:

A few years ago, my little brother was killed in a farming accident right before I entered law school. This led to a series of events that would include to me drinking a fifth or two of hard liquor everyday combined with around 10-12mg of Xanax or 18-20mg of Klonopin. I was also doing MDMA 4-5 times a week, and occasionally smoking crack and meth. I did this on a daily basis, save for the occasional week or two of guilt related abstinence. Inevitably, I lost my scholarship and was reprimanded for frequently going to lectures under the influence. My fiancee left me, and I accidentally overdosed on a Xanax laced with fentanyl in August of 2020. This was still not enough for me to stop. I was essentially in a semi-permanent state of blackout, my ability to plan, reason, or even remember basic details about important events was almost non-existent. I struggled to maintain employment, and got to the point where I was isolating from the few remaining people that I hadn't alienated. After a couple failed stints in rehab, this all came to a head when in April, while on my way to cover a baseball game for the local newspaper, I got a DUI. I blew a .27, and was promptly fired. 

So then I unsuccessfully tried to drink myself to death. Once I had drained my bank accounts into the red, I didn't know what to do. Out of money, friends, food, booze and pills, I knew if I was going to continue to live, I needed to get help. Luckily, I found a halfway house a couple hours away that my insurance covered who said they would admit me. The problem was, it required 72 hours of sobriety. So the next day I found a ride, lied about how long I had sober, and checked myself in. I had the experience of going through extreme withdrawal without the aid of any medication over the next couple weeks. Eventually, I leveled out and I was surprised when my mind cleared a lot quicker than I expected. I became dedicated to my recovery, and attended the 90 meetings in 90 days that so many AA's deem essential.

After three months, I had secured a decent paying and stable job working at the corporate office of a bank. I got my own apartment, and moved out of the halfway house. My DUI got dismissed on a technicality, and my license was reinstated. I even got admitted into graduate school at the local university to get my MBA in Accounting.

But the thing is, I started smoking weed again a couple months ago (I live fairly close to a dispensary). Having PTSD and chronic pain from a motorcycle accident some years ago, it seems to be the one thing other than alcohol which gives me psychological relief. I know this is frowned upon, but I gotta say, it's working. I feel a lot more grounded and less depressed. While I have heard countless stories about people relapsing on their drug/drink of choice after resuming cannabis usage, I have not had that desire whatsoever. 

This choice has led to issues related to my local AA circle. After telling my girlfriend in confidence, she broke up with me over it, and started telling people I had relapsed at meetings when I wasn't there. Friendships have ended, and I have been lying about it to my sponsor to avoid judgment. 

I feel like this response is counter-intuitive to the purpose of AA, of which the only requirement is a desire to stop drinking, which I did. Now I'm in a position where I need to choose between my own mental health, or acting like a had some big relapse to appease these fair-weather friends in the program. Truth be told, I'm a little disgusted. It all comes off as disingenuous, where uncompromising adherence to the accepted status quo (not even principles or steps) is required for support and acceptance, and I'm not about that. I don't think I should have to change what is working for me to get the approval of people that are blindly following their ""crowd"" with little to no independent thought about the real complexity of addiction, or how everyone's experience in recovery is different. I'm frustrated, and I feel a little betrayed by these individuals who I had grown to consider friends.

841,"'THE ACID TEST'

As we work the first nine Steps, we prepare ourselves for the adventure of a new life.  But when we approach Step Ten we commence to put our A.A. way of living to practical use, day by day, in fair weather or foul.  Then comes the acid test: can we stay sober, keep in emotional balance, and live to good purpose under all conditions?

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 88

I know the Promises are being fulfilled in my life, but I want to maintain and develop them by the daily application of Step Ten.  I have learned through this Step that if I am disturbed, there is something wrong with me.  The other person may be wrong too, but I can only deal with my feelings.  When I am hurt or upset, I have to continually look for the cause in me, and then I have to admit and correct my mistakes.  It isn't easy, but as long as I know I am progressing spiritually, I know that I can mark my effort up as a job well done.  I have found that pain is a friend; it lets me know there is something wrong with my emotions, just as a physical pain lets me know there is something wrong with my body.  When I take the appropriate action through the Twelve Steps, the pain gradually goes away.

845,"Hi all,

2 years alcohol free here. Just got back from a data at a trendy restaurant. Being hip and all, water was served out of liquour bottles. ex. our table had a tequila bottle with water inside.

Even though I'm sure this tequila bottle had been cleaned out, it still made me nervous to drink water that had been in the same container as tequila. I did just want to go with the flow and so drank water out of this tequila bottle.

The water tasted like water, nothing funny about it, etc. But I am thinking about alcohol now - probably just a placebo effect. But I'm wondering if I could have ingested any tequila or other alcohol from this?

TLDR: IS it safe for recovering alcoholics to drink water out of tequila or vodka bottles that have been cleaned and refurbished as water containers?

Thanks.",alcoholicsanonymous,hi 2 year alcohol free got back data trendy restaurant hip water served liquour bottle ex table tequila bottle water inside even though im sure tequila bottle cleaned still made nervous drink water container tequila want go flow drank water tequila bottle water tasted like water nothing funny etc thinking alcohol probably placebo effect im wondering could ingested tequila alcohol tldr safe recovering alcoholic drink water tequila vodka bottle cleaned refurbished water container thanks

853,"Hello :) My father has been an alcoholic for about 27 years. He doesn't admit (well, he admitted once) and walks away on anyone who wants to talk about it with him. He refuses help. Recently he said he didn't know why he did it (drinking) and that he was gonna stop. Of course he wouldn't be able to do it by himself, but he denied external help like AA or a psychiatrist; and of course he started drinking again in less than a month.

Now, I don't live with him. In fact, I live in another state, but I'm visiting and I'm close to his house. We were supposed to travel together, but because he is drinking heavily again, I called it off and told him about it. But I still want to sit down and talk to him, in person, and be serious about this. I've scheduled and paid for a psychiatrist for him to go on Monday. So this would be the talk: I want to help you, please admit you need help, the psychiatrist it paid for.

But what is the best way to say this? I don't know how to talk in way that is 1) loving; 2) effective and 3) serious, having in mind that he is been an alcoholic for almost 30 years. What should be my approach? How not to offend him or get him defensive?

In his shoes, what would you like to hear from your daughter or anyone close to you that wants to help you? Or, if you're not a (recovery/recovered) alcoholic, have you ever helped anyone in this manner and what did work for you?

I really need this help.

It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels.  We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

When I am in pain it is easy to stay close to the friends I have found in the program.  Relief from that pain is provided in the solutions contained in A.A.'s Twelve Steps.  But when I am feeling good and things are going well, I can become complacent.  To put it simply, I become lazy and turn into the problem instead of the solution.  I need to get into action, to take stock: where am I and where am I going?  A daily inventory will tell me what I must change to regain spiritual balance.  Admitting what I find within myself, to God and to another human being, keeps me honest and humble.

862,"As of today, I haven't had a drink or a drug in 8 years.  Last month was my 30th birthday.  I got sober, in AA, at 22.

Needless to say, when I was a kid or a teenager I didn't expect that by the time I was 22 I'd have already been an alcoholic and in recovery.  But that's how things ended up working out.

It's been a relatively tough year for me.  I've had a string of medical problems that, while none of them super serious, have been very annoying and made day-to-day life a hassle.  It all started with the realization and diagnosis that I had tinnitus and some minor hearing loss, presumably from too much rock and roll.  I never expected it to happen to me, but it did (protect your ears!)  Luckily it's not too bad, but it was hard to come to terms with it.  Some days I still struggle.

In the last few years since getting sober I took a liking to being fit and active.  Unfortunately, I pushed things a little too hard, and about 4 months ago I developed a pain in my foot that basically kept me off my feet for 3 whole months.  I decided to try swimming, and due to improper technique, I injured my back, too.  I was really angry.   It's like I couldn't get a good streak going.

But what they taught me in AA was ""life's terms, not mine"".  My foot has healed.  My back has healed.  I still have tinnitus but I've come to terms with it.  You know what would have happened back when I was drinking?  I would have self-destructed.  

Nowadays it's completely different for me.  I remember someone shared this at an AA meeting once: ""now I have problems, but I just walk through them"".  That's what I did.  One day at a time.  Despite the annoyance, frustration, and all the other crap.  Sometimes all you have to do is *keep going*.  I guess that's why they say ""keep coming back"".

Writing it all out now it all seems like pretty small stuff, but in the moment it's horrific.  It brings up the question, for me, of ""what the hell is even the point of all this anyway if it's just going to be one thing after another?""  That's what it brought up in me.  But I kept going.

And thanks to that, not only did I remain sober, but I also had the opportunity to do some really cool things.  I started reading a lot this year.  I took to writing more seriously.  I got more comfortable with myself and had an easier time doing what I wanted to do.  I didn't experience so much anxiety or depression.  I fell in love and enjoyed it.  

I think that's the greatest gift of sobriety: not only does it save us from self-destruction, it also gives us the opportunity to do something really cool with our lives.  It just takes a little patience sometimes.

If I had to draw any broad conclusion from these 8 years, it's that things *do* get better.  You have to be a little courageous, that much is true.  But you don't have to be superhuman.  All you have to do is follow your heart, and learn to trust.  If you can do that, somehow, things tend to work out.  It's OK to relax.  It's OK to be yourself.  It's OK to enjoy life. 

Life is truly beautiful, and I have sobriety and the foundation I learned in AA for giving me this second chance.

Best wishes to all.",alcoholicsanonymous,today havent drink drug 8 year last month 30th birthday got sober aa 22 needle say kid teenager didnt expect time 22 id already alcoholic recovery thats thing ended working relatively tough year ive string medical problem none super serious annoying made daytoday life hassle started realization diagnosis tinnitus minor hearing loss presumably much rock roll never expected happen protect ear luckily bad hard come term day still struggle last year since getting sober took liking fit active unfortunately pushed thing little hard 4 month ago developed pain foot basically kept foot 3 whole month decided try swimming due improper technique injured back really angry like couldnt get good streak going taught aa life term mine foot healed back healed still tinnitus ive come term know would happened back drinking would selfdestructed nowadays completely different remember someone shared aa meeting problem walk thats one day time despite annoyance frustration crap sometimes keep going guess thats say keep coming back writing seems like pretty small stuff moment horrific brings question hell even point anyway going one thing another thats brought kept going thanks remain sober also opportunity really cool thing started reading lot year took writing seriously got comfortable easier time wanted didnt experience much anxiety depression fell love enjoyed think thats greatest gift sobriety save u selfdestruction also give u opportunity something really cool life take little patience sometimes draw broad conclusion 8 year thing get better little courageous much true dont superhuman follow heart learn trust somehow thing tend work ok relax ok ok enjoy life life truly beautiful sobriety foundation learned aa giving second chance best wish

871,"So I've been with my gf for over 3 years now and she has been very supportive of me getting help for my recently accepted alcoholism. In the past months I've been to a couple of rehabs and had 90 days under my belt Friday. However, Friday I slipped and had a few drinks at her apartment that I visit on the weekends because I live in a half way house that only allows overnights on the weekends. I'll provide better context.

So she works often times 7 days a week at bars that close very late, the one she works at majority of the time closes at 4am. So since I've been out of rehab and at this house, the past several weekends Ive been picking up her apt keys while shes at work and go to her place to hang out, enjoy not being around other guys in a home setting and enjoying her much more comfortable bed so we can spend sometime together when she gets off very late. Now we've had some strain in the past about her work life and how she can be not great at scheduling because often she'll sleep for 10 plus hours then go start into work mood (we agree she probably has a sleep disorder but that's another conversation). So the constraints of the house rules during the week and limitations of the weekend make it so there is super limited time together as is so this was a win win dynamic.

So more on how the life style conflicts. She mainly has only friends in the service industry and mainly spends non working hours of leisure at the bar(s) she works at or in a casual party setting aka alcohol around aplenty. The past couple weekends if I wanted to see her before she crawled into bed after the next day's sunup I would hang out at the bar shes tending and its a dive so there is time for us to steal little interactions and moments together. I was geniunely confident in my program to be able to hang out there but also had the ability to know when its getting too much and say Im going to leave. Kind of. The past three weekends I gently told her Im ready to go and she innocently did the ""sure thing! Give me a few to say goodbye and everything"" but still a few hours would go by. Or I would leave right when I wanted/needed to and when she would get off work early enough to where we could have some quality time one on one at her place (no innuendo intended) she chose or ""got guilted"" into staying out/ going out with her bar friends.

Which bring me to Friday. I walked into her room and theres a full glass of wine right next to her bed. This isnt the first time something like that happened, a couple weeks prior she had a plate with a small bit of cocaine left from hanging out with coworker friends. She did have issues with coke in the past but it is now a couple times in the span of a 6 months thing. I ask every so often about it and she assures its not an issue and I trust so I take that as it. So I drank that wine not cuz of her or the bad traffic or my depression kicking my ass that week, I drank because I chose to drink. All this focus on her choices and behavior, none of that is a deflection, I take fully ownership of my relaspe. I do. I told her what happened within 10 mins of her getting home, she yelled and called me a fucking asshole and said Im not allowed to hang out at her place like weve been doing anymore. After we both cooled down, I agreed that is probably a good call and I shouldnt be bar visiting anymore. Like the wine glass being around it close enough to smell it, was way too much for me. I told my sponsor the next day (I drank at like 2am on that friday so I told sponsor saturday).  But during the post confession talk she was crying saying she's scared our lives might not be capatable and she feels torn between me and bartending which she really does love.

And admittedly I have had a blinspot for her with asserting boundaries in the recent past. In the spring which I in the end stages of denial of my alcoholism, I told her I was having a bad week with drinking and was looking forward to an evening of quality time with her. We go to a nice dinner and movie, and after she wanted to keep the night going so she asked if we could go to a bar after the movie. I said okay as long as its not gonna be too late which was true but she ended up getting semi sloppy drunk (which is rare for her around me or not) so much so that when we were fooling around later that night I had to use our safeword because she was biting and scratching too hard to the point where she popped a blood vessel in my lip from biting.

The other big and recent example was we went to her cousin's wedding over the summer and this was after my first go in rehab and real attempt at sobriety. She asked if it was okay mutiple times for her to have only a couple drinks at the wedding which i really did think was fine. Well throughout the weekend she made several comments and I see it in her demeanor she was craving time with family (mainly her cousins that shes close with- mutiple of them have been in each others wedding parties including my gf  they just live all over the US). Seeing them take shots and get dancy she asked if it was okay if she drank some more which I said was fine. I was semi fine with it but on the 14 plus drive over she without prompting from me said she wouldnt drink period on the trip, so with some permission from the guidelines kept moving partially out of guilt from depriving her from a time with she was craving and/or the fear that she would low key feel I deprived her of it.

So semi in conclusion, I really do love this woman and she does me. She has been a catalyst for me seeking self improvement before and after admitting my disease. Friday evening did include a talk about how I havent put myself in smart situations but also reviewing how her/our social life needs readjusting. She cried and shes been feeling like shes been a bad partner. There's also a recent thing about we/she talked up so much about visiting me in rehab but overslept and missed the time window. I assured her she is absolutely not and she has helped me tremendously throughout our relationship. But there is strains. We are SO dependent on her schedule in order to see each other. Its always been like that in our relationship, spending time together on her terms basically. I explained to her Friday how cravings work and how scienctifically a craving can be as strong as the mental feeling of starving or being real thrist. I've asked her and she excitedly agreed months ago to go to Alano but still hasnt and now getting irked when i mention it since she ""is strapped for time."" But I think my fear over this leading to more conflict and to be super honest the downfall of our relationship culminated in me deciding to drink.

So TLDR: I am in early recovery and trying to avoid alcohol while my gf's lifestyle actively is surrounded by it.

The program, my sponsor and my renewed faith is helping me so much. 

I thank God that I learned about AA.  But how did so many AA members from various walks of life know that we all suffered from this disease that was “but a symptom?”

881,"8 months Sober. 

It's hard to explain where i'm at. On one side I have found the resilience to give up on something that once had it's claws all wrapped around my inner self. It dictated how I felt and whispered lies of comfort. 

Today I sit here, wondering what did it take? What has changed? Why when I think of drugs or alcohol do I no longer feel intimidated or drawn by it. Reading through my facebook posts from the last 8 months I come to realise that a lot of it is due to me facing myself. Yet lately, I find myself ignoring a lot. People I dearly miss and wish I had the courage to reach out to. Things I desperately would want to have the courage to undertake. All in all, life has truly been a blessing. I have met some wonderful people that have given me more to appreciate than just my own centre of a world. Look within myself is still a daily task. It's not a bad one though, it's alleviating to remind myself that I am not the center of things. Every day is a hill I climb in order to get closer and closer to my ultimate goal. And even If I never reach the top, I can find peace in knowing that i'm trying every day to maintain active what keeps me sober. I think back and as dark as things have been and sometimes still are, I really feel liberated. Truly find so much serenity in knowing that i'm doing best and upholding standards I strive to live up to every day.

I have so much gratitude for the people in my lives. Every single one them have brought me where I am today and I thank them for doing so. Wether for better or worse, I finally can say that i'm confident about how I feel. Will things get rough? Possibly. As long as I take it a day at a time and don't let my own head get the best of me, I know i'll be fine.

It is in the acceptance of how things are that I can find serenity. Finding peace and finding love is all that matters. I embrace life fully and feel it all again. Laughing like a child brings me back to a place of no sorrows. Allowing myself to feel is what truly is beautiful about life. Nothing compares to how determined I am to never go back to how things were. It wasn't so much about not drinking and so much more about not wanting to.

Today I can say confidently that I want to be sober and embrace the feelings that come with it. I no longer want to ignore and undermine myself. My feelings matter to me and I am ok with them being around.

The circle stands for the whole world of A.A., and the triangle stands for A.A.'s Three Legacies of Recovery, Unity, and Service.  Within our wonderful new world, we have found freedom from our fatal obsession.

- A.A. COMES OF AGE, p. 139

Early in my A.A. life, I became employed in its services and I found the explanation of our society's logo to be very appropriate.  First, a circle of love and service with a well-balanced triangle inside, the base of which represents our Recovery through the Twelve Steps.  Then the other two sides, representing Unity and Service, respectively.  The three sides of the triangle are equal.  As I grew in A.A. I soon identified myself with this symbol.  I am the circle, and the sides of the triangle represent three aspects of my personality: physical, emotional sanity, and spirituality, the latter forming the symbol's base.  Taken together, all three aspects of my personality translate into a sober and happy life.

I couldn't get 100% sober I made some bad choices while in this group and since then it has broken up I would always rembber the guy who ran it going behind people's backs and telling them personal things about that person for example if someone had being using/drinking in there room alone the past 2 years and told him in privet he would tell other people in privet then tell us not to discuss group anywhere else that was the first double standard 

I went to another drug and alcohol counseler after this and told her everything about that group thinking she would keep it confidential but she used it to try attack the person who made his own AA sort of group and now I'm the one who's to blame

890,"I heard this when I first started coming and didn't believe it. I thought if I could only get this alcohol thing under control,  all would be well.

Turns out, even without the alcohol I am unhappy. Im an asshole. Im cynical. Im self centered. My nature is to hold on to grudges,  be angry, and to be unapologetic. Im a natural ""poor me"" kinda person.  So I started thinking; maybe my thinking is my problem. 

If I have busted thinking, how would I know? Would thinking about my thinking be enough to realize thinking is my problem?  

If Im walking around with a broken compass, how would I know its pointing the wrong way?  Even after I repeatedly end up in fucked up places, I just keep following this compass because its all I have to guide me.

Then people with perfectly fine compasses (like doctors, psychiatrists, judges, family members) try to tell me ""hey man, YOU'RE HEADING THE WRONG WAY"" and I just keep following this broken ass compass. These people don't understand and haven't had the shitty life I've had. Why listen to them?

Then I met other people in AA with broken compasses too. Its like a group of people said ""hey, we think our compass is busted too. We keep following it thinking we're doing good but then we end up in fucked up places again.  But there is this book and these 12 steps that are like a map. You can put down that busted-ass compass and follow this instead. Enough of us with severely broken compasses have made it out by following these. Give it a try.""  These people understand and have had a similar life. I can listen to these people.

906,"On February 12th of this year I was arrested for a 4th offense OWI. (My previous 3 were 10 years ago.) I spent 4 and 1/2 terrifying days in jail. I was blacked out when the arrest happened so I really didn't know what had happened until I got out. I started going to meetings the day after I got out of jail. Really threw myself into the program, got a sponsor, worked the steps and things slowly started getting better. 

I even made some friends, including a man with ""4 years of Sobriety"" that I became fairly close with. He ended up wanting to be more than friends, I told him I wasn't really interested in him like that but he was really, really persistent and to be honest it felt really nice to have someone pay so much attention to me. He was always there if I needed something and checked in on me. But he also had a tendency to gossip about other people in the program, telling me who was ""actually sober"" who smoked pot or did other drugs and it got in my head. 

The day after my 6 month mark I said fuck it and got drunk for 3 days. Came back, first stepped. Made it 2 weeks, and I hung out with the guy again. Found out that in reality he didn't have the 4 years he claimed and that he'd drank periodically over the past year or so. And we got drunk together, for like a week straight. He went to detox and I went back to my meetings again. I told him we couldn't hang out any more. But he didn't really like that and started pursuing me more intently. I relapsed again one night and I was really down on myself about it and didn't know who to turn to, I'd stopped communicating with my sponsor by that time and I just struggled to find the courage to reach out to anyone else. But he reached out to me and the morning after he came over to ""help."" He gave me one of his oxys (I don't even like opiates??) And then he left to go get us lunch. He came back with a bunch of alcohol and we got hammered. The next day I told him that I absolutely couldn't hang out with him or even talk to him anymore and to stay away from me. 

But I haven't stopped drinking since. That was 3 weeks ago. I've been completely isolating myself, embarrassed and drunk and feeling like a piece of shit. I'm scared to go back to my meetings because I don't want to risk running into him again and because I'm ashamed and embarrassed by my weakness. 

I'm really going to try not to drink today, and hopefully find a new meeting where he won't be tomorrow. But I'm still just so embarrassed. I felt like I was doing so well and everything just came crashing down around me. I'm tired of feeling worthless and stupid and scared of everything. 

I don't want to bring this story up at the meetings here because the AA world is small in my town and there's a high probability someone would know who I'm talking about and I'm not trying to throw him under the bus. I know he's sick too and it's not his fault, I drank because I wanted to drink, not because of anything he did, but at the same time it's not a good situation. 

How do I pluck up the courage to walk back in and admit my failure and start over? Ugh. This whole thing just sucks 😞

910,"It's three years to the day since my last drink. I barely remember it like it was yesterday. On my last night of drinking, I promised not to get drunk, then drank alone in a garage through the entirety of a child's birthday party, drove my family home (drunk) and faded to black. I was sitting in my first AA meeting less than 24 hours later. 

AA saved my life. I don't care if it's a trope. I am alive today because the people in those rooms took me in, showed me the way and I was beat down enough to listen. There are so many close calls, drunk accidents, fights, health and legal issues and insane decisions... I really don't know how I survived long enough to even make it to the rooms but I know I wouldn't have made it much longer. 

I'm posting today to share my hope. I used to think I was a mid-bottom drunk because I never killed anyone or went to jail. I later heard from others I was probably a low-bottom drunk based on my story. Eventually, I realized it didn't matter. I was just a drunk. The important part is the recovery - and I am, through the power of something greater than myself, recovered. Not recover-ING. Recover-ED. As the book says, I have ""recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body"" through the 12 Steps. 

Since entering the program, the promises in the book have been fulfilled in my life. I have a peace I've never had. I have patience, I love deeper, I can experience being loved, I can provide and be of service. My marriage was saved, I lost 40 pounds, our sex is 20x better, I make triple what I did when I was drinking, I paid off all my taxes, lawsuits, legal fees and maxed out credit cards. I am a father to my kid - like an actually present one involved in her world. I've dealt with mental health issues previously hidden by self-medication with drugs and alcohol. You literally would not recognize me, whether looking at me or my actions. I still have problems, character defects and struggle. It's not perfect and it never will be. But it doesn't have to be and I know no substance or destructive behavior is going to fill that hole. The longing I felt will sometimes return - and when it does, there is a solution: the 12 Steps.

If you're new, if you're suffering, if you don't know what is going to get you out of the hell you are in: I suggest you give them a real shot. Taken as prescribed, with rigorous honesty, they really do work. Essentially, they're a catalyst to spiritual experience, or ""limit experience"", some might say. A way to induce a radical change in the way you view the world around you - and really a change in yourself. They work.

If you've got less time than me, I hope reading this inspires you. You should know reading your experiences and struggles on this sub inspires me, bringing the brutal truth of alcoholism freshly into my memory. It has a habit of fading. You keep me motivated. I'm grateful to have talked with a lot of people from this sub, and hopefully helped. There is a way out and you are on the right path. 

If you've got more time than me, I'm inspired by your strength and experience. Thank you for being here and passing hope and knowledge on to us youngins. 

I am just overwhelmingly grateful to the program, the community, and my higher power.

A man came to the meeting drunk, interrupted the speakers, stood up and took his shirt off, staggered loudly back and forth for coffee, demanded to talk, and eventually called the group's secretary an unquotable name and walked out.  I was glad he was there – once again I saw what I had been like.  But I also saw what I still am, and what I still could be.  I don't have to be drunk to want to be the exception and the center of attention.  I have often felt abused and responded abusively when I was simply being treated as a garden variety human being.  The more the man tried to insist he was different, the more I realized that he and I were exactly alike.

I made it 6 months from mid June 2020- early January 2021. Relapsed, drank myself silly for a month and ended up in treatment in February 2021-April 2021. I've been sober since February 7, 2021 so I've now made it 7 months sober (almost 8). However, now I'm feeling that compulsion to drink again.

931,"My childhood wasn’t great. I was forced by my mother to be her personal therapist, she always dumped all her shit on me and blamed me for not handling it perfectly. I was sexually abused by multiple people growing up, and both my parents were violent, throwing things around and punching holes in walls. I turned to alcohol at 14, and was an alcoholic until 18, when what I’m about to describe happened. 

Due to my abuse I was weird at school. I confided in people too quickly, I couldn’t keep my hands to myself, etc. I didn’t know how to make friends. But one boy (also 18 at the time) in particular gave me the time of day. He was kind to me… which was something that I was missing in my life. We began dating, but I was toxic. He cut me off, and I thought that if I really loved him, I couldn’t let him out of my grasp. 

I began stalking him and harassing him… I followed him home from school, would try to talk to him, I created multiple social media accounts to message him to the point of him having to delete his social media’s, etc. But one night, I got really drunk, and the amazing idea of breaking into his house came to me. I went to his house and entered through an open window, which led to his little sister’s bedroom. In a drunken rage I began yelling at her, and he and his parents rushed into the room to try and get me out. They ended up calling the police and I was arrested, there was a trial, and I ended up going to jail for a year. 

Since then I’ve been in therapy and have been required to do a 12 step program. I’m on the step of “making amends”, and that brought this back up in my mind. I’m certain that I traumatized that family, especially the little girl… do you think they would want to receive an apologetic letter from me?

934,"Hi,

I'm a 24 year old and I feel like I might be developing a problem. I've had previous encounters with many substances and despite struggling with very addictive ones  (benzos) I managed to give them up all on my own and have never looked back. 

Here in Australia alcohol is the only accepted ""drug"" and weed and all other substances are frowned upon which is completely fine but as they say: ""Everyone has their poison"", and very early on 14 or so mine was alcohol. 

I was hospitalized, I've woken up hours away from my home, I've ran face first into a fish tank, I've never done anything malignant or harmful to other ppl beyond when I drove drunk and nearly drove off a cliff a few years back.  Despite mostly ending my own life, If the story was written different I could have harmed someone else. I've tried to end my life and resorted to self harm a lot because of the way I am.

when I'm sober I honestly believe I'm in control despite knowing the impacts it's having on my work, life, mental health, family and it ruined a great relationship 2 years back.

The saddest part is, part of me honestly believes I'm still winning and in control when I give it time. 

It's like I recycle shit emotions for new ones each time.

I might stop for a day or two and say ""never again"" but I'm right back at it once the guilt takes it's course.

We have a massive drinking culture here in Aus and a lot of my friends are bonded over a beer so in regards of feeling lonely it's difficult. I'm also quite shy and find a few drinks let me have a good time. But I can't stop and often prefer drinking alone, so despite seeing friends I'll end up going home and continuing the drinking alone.

I moved from spirits to beer which was a massive help. I could limit myself at least and keep track. But it became a heavy hitter on the bank and also despite never being over weight I started to notice a beer gut. 

But I find myself stuck in this loop of what I have is not enough, and I wake up depressed and anxious about my decisions and actions the previous night, although most are not terrible or destructive; mostly talking to friends a bit to lively than usual, or staying up too late, I draw the line at not being able to wake up for work and messaging ppl at stupid hours when most ppl have a life and aren't up all night. It's embarrassing... I have gotten far better at controlling that which also worries me.

I use to work at a liquor store and I finally got a new job which I hoped would set me straight, and it did but I've found myself stuck in this same loop of ""If I only buy 4 beers it'll be fine"" and end up sourcing alcohol elsewhere after. 

I've obviously tried not drinking, but alcohol is all over my house, I could walk blindfolded and run into a long island iced tea.

I guess I'm scared that once I stop that is it I can't ever drink again. I loose my social life, I get bored of hanging out with the people I grew up with despite majority of them being far more interesting than I am and I end up just living a life more or less dedicated to fuck all.

It's also very family oriented, I have to learn to talk to my own family without drinking and watching them drink. This is very genetic alcoholism runs in my family.

I'm aware I need to stop, to be honest its just really shit that I have to... And honestly scary.

I appreciate it's short sighted, but it's hard to see new doors opening when you're so focused on the ones you wish you didn't have to close. 

I don't expect ppl to have all the answers, but I'm very curious based off what I've told you, would you please enlighten me on what might help, profession help, or what helped you?",alcoholicsanonymous,hi im 24 year old feel like might developing problem ive previous encounter many substance despite struggling addictive one benzos managed give never looked back australia alcohol accepted drug weed substance frowned upon completely fine say everyone poison early 14 mine alcohol hospitalized ive woken hour away home ive ran face first fish tank ive never done anything malignant harmful ppl beyond drove drunk nearly drove cliff year back despite mostly ending life story written different could harmed someone else ive tried end life resorted self harm lot way im sober honestly believe im control despite knowing impact work life mental health family ruined great relationship 2 year back saddest part part honestly belief im still winning control give time like recycle shit emotion new one time might stop day two say never im right back guilt take course massive drinking culture au lot friend bonded beer regard feeling lonely difficult im also quite shy find drink let good time cant stop often prefer drinking alone despite seeing friend ill end going home continuing drinking alone moved spirit beer massive help could limit least keep track became heavy hitter bank also despite never weight started notice beer gut find stuck loop enough wake depressed anxious decision action previous night although terrible destructive mostly talking friend bit lively usual staying late draw line able wake work messaging ppl stupid hour ppl life arent night embarrassing gotten far better controlling also worry use work liquor store finally got new job hoped would set straight ive found stuck loop buy 4 beer itll fine end sourcing alcohol elsewhere ive obviously tried drinking alcohol house could walk blindfolded run long island iced tea guess im scared stop cant ever drink loose social life get bored hanging people grew despite majority far interesting end living life le dedicated fuck also family oriented learn talk family without drinking watching drink genetic alcoholism run family im aware need stop honest really shit honestly scary appreciate short sighted hard see new door opening youre focused one wish didnt close dont expect ppl answer im curious based ive told would please enlighten might help profession help helped

I recently acknowledged I have an issue with alcohol. I'm really struggling with self hatred over the bad things I've done blackout drunk and what they mean about who I am as a person. I don't know how to move forward and forgive myself. I'm a different person when I'm sober but I judge myself for the things I've done intoxicated.

941,"Sobriety has changed my life in so many ways despite it only being the very beginning of my journey.. But this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside (the way I used to claim alcohol made me feel, except this is a real feeling). 

My fiancé is finally warming up to me again. My rock bottom wasn’t when I was hospitalized multiple times for alcohol poisoning, fired from my job, woke up in strange places, injured my neck or broke a rib… What truly hit me and made me want to do this was my fiancé being one and a half feet out the door… Something about the thought of losing him made me take a long hard look at myself and something in my brain ticked and told me I HAVE to do this. I NEED change. For the sake of my life, my health, my future, my sanity and my family. I started putting in the work, attending meetings (sometimes 2 a day) and building a foundation to get and stay sober… One day, one moment at a time. 

He started holding my hand and saying “I love you” first again… He came on to me first for the first time in over a year. I can’t blame him since being 8 drinks deep, slurring and stumbling isn’t exactly a turn on. Nor was being depressed from booze or hungover… 

I was horrible to him… I was never mean or violent but him seeing me a drunken mess definitely took it’s toll. Him seeing me taken away in an ambulance or having to pick me up from a hospital cause I passed out drunk in public. Him coming home to seeing me passed out in the shower or after raiding the fridge. I was horrible to myself. I’d lie about how much I consumed and put alcohol before his feelings despite him always telling me (and me knowing yet denying) that it was a BIG problem. Nobody deserves to see their significant other in such a state… 

I’m truly blessed to have another chance… To be able to love myself and him right. To be able to show myself and him that I truly can change… Oppose to making empty promises about “next time” like I used to. Promising that it’ll “never happen again”…until it did…cause I didn’t take sobriety seriously or put in any effort whatsoever. But this time is and will be different. 

Yesterday we spent the entire day together.. We cuddled, held hands, played video games, went to the movies, laughed and enjoyed our time together. To truly be there for him… for us.. Felt amazing. To live and appreciate every moment. Even just running errands with him. Unlike when I was a drunk and didn’t know how to appreciate the simple things in life… Now every moment is a blessing. To have my best friend back… I can’t even begin to explain how happy I feel..

The work must continue. I won’t stop now just cause I’m finally getting the love of my life back. This is only the beginning. But seeing how rewarding sobriety can be has truly given me a new perspective on life. It gives me the drive to keep going. To keep doing better.

Sponsorship held two surprises for me.  First, that my sponsees cared about me.  What I had thought was gratitude was more like love.  They wanted me to be happy, to grow and remain sober.  Knowing how they felt kept me from drinking more than once.  Second, I discovered that I was able to love someone else responsibly, with respectful and genuine concern for that person's growth.  Before that time, I had thought that my ability to care sincerely about another's well-being had atrophied from lack of use.  To learn that I can love, without greed or anxiety, has been one of the deepest gifts the program has given me.  Gratitude for that gift has kept me sober many times.

958,"My friend and I are both 24 years old. I’ve known him since he was 13. All our lives growing up he’s always had emotional issues. It all started when some girl broke his heart when he was like 16. He become bitter and got anger issues. As time went on he got better and when he was 19 he started taking up smoking weed. It seemed to help him mellow out a lot but I noticed over the years he become very in his head and depressed. About 2 years ago he started to date a girl who was an alcoholic, she ended up cheating on him and it really hurt him. What made matters worse is he picked up her habits of drinking along the way. Now as the years passed he’s been in and out of jobs and also has gotten into another relationship that he isn’t happy in (says he is but then will complain about what she does to him. Some of the stuff is brutal) They finally broke up and now I’m just worried about him because he can’t stop drinking, he’s depressed about this girl and might get back with her and he hasn’t had a job since May. As a friend how do I handle this?

It started out not that bad but once he got into this new relationship about a year ago it’s gotten so much worse. Before it was subtle but now unfortunately I’m embarrassed to go out in public with him because he’ll start swearing and saying things out loud that you really shouldn’t.

962,"Just today I realised that I'm a huge piece of shit. I used to think I was a good person with a problem that needed fixing but I realised that when it came down to it I was just a good person when it's easy to be but I realised that for the last few years whenever I had to make a decision between the right choice or the selfish choice to get fucked up on drugs/alcohol/sex ignoring my responsibilities and the well bring of those around me I always chose the selfish option because it made me feel good/happy for awhile without caring for the consequences to make myself feel better just because I had a fucked up life with long lasting trauma that doesn't mean I have any right to potentially fuck up someone else's to make myself feel better for a few hours.

These last few years have possibly been the worst years of my life so bad that I tried to commit suicide by overdosing a few months ago. I never intended to hurt people intentionally I would never want to hurt the ones I love and innocent people but I have destroyed good meaningful relationships and hurt friends and loved ones and I've even put people into dangerous positions where someone could've been seriously injured or even killed. Everytime I would blackout I always used to think these were mistakes and that I was just a danger to myself but I realise now they weren't mistakes at all and that my self destructive choices have harmed other people.

I chose to do this shit over and over and over again even when I knew what could happen and that once I start drinking I can not stop. Something deep inside me wants to self destruct. I have been battling alcohol abuse since I was a teenager but no one controlled me or forced me, I gladly and willingly chose the ""fun"" option to make myself feel better by self medicating over the right one even when I knew the potential consequences but ""this time I can control myself"" I would tell myself. I'm so lucky I have never seriously harmed or injured someone else and that the only consequence is that some people hate me and avoid me even after I have apologised and even though they've accepted and pretend it's okay now but I can feel it whenever I happen to see them and I deserve it.  I can live with people hating me for being a fucking mess but I would never be able to forgive or live with myself if I seriously harmed anyone or caused someone's death that wasn't my own.

The reason why I realised these things about myself is because I have very slowly managed to pull myself out of the hole I was trying to get out of for the past 6 years 
(I've been going to therapy and I've had about 10 different therapists, 3 different rehabs and psychologists trying to fix myself but fuck me it was a hard and terrible road for everyone.) and I can finally see things clearly without the cloud of self loathing and hatred obscuring my vision. I haven't blacked out in months and it's been almost a year since I've had a major incident and that's because I met a wonderful girl (she's honestly one of the best and most pure person I've ever met, thinking of doing something that would hurt her finally knocked some sense into me, everytime I think I might potentially hurt her feels like a punch in my gut. She doesn't deserve it and honestly I don't even deserve her she's too good for me) and with the help of my family who never abandoned me and has always supported me especially my poor father. I must've aged him by an extra 10 years.

I haven't eaten or slept in 2 days because the full consequences and scope of my actions have finally dawned on me after I returned from one of the best weekends of my life with my girl without using drugs or alcohol which is the first time in my life that I've had that much fun sober or fucked up.
 I admit it I'm an asshole, I'm a self centered, self hating piece of fucking shit and I couldn't even see it until now. But that all changes today.

This realisation is very hard to process and it's really hard to not hate myself for everything I've done even with all the progress I've made since.

Since Ive been at university Ive used alcohol to get to sleep, which I think in lots of respects contributed to my psychotic episode last year. Since then my use of alcohol has spiralled, to a point where this weekend I had a bit of a breakdown and ended up in hospital after attempting to unlive. The doctors have said the best method for treatment is at home as Im not having any delusions, just a few auditory hallucinations. ive always been quite depressed so ive been feeling a bit hopeless about that ever changing. I was wondering if anyone could give some advice on how to continue without A:being intoxicated B:without the grand ideals which came with psychosis. I think have this really stupid god complex where i can only be content when life is extraordinary (e.g becoming a rockstar that makes people love eachother more, or an amazing relationship, or starting a revolution to dismantle capitalism, which in turn causes a much needed change in western culture). I know those examples are delusional but they aren’t delusions, they are just desires as I don’t believe any of those things would ever come true. I actually really liked being psychotic cause I at least believed they would come true, which brought me a lot of content. I think thats why I wanted to commit. Cause i dont want to keep working my ass off to feel no joy whatsoever. There is no meaning in working the 9 to 5 for the rest of my life to make someone else rich, when all i get back is social anxiety, depression and some money to pay for bills and booze.

966,"I knew dating within the rooms or getting involved in any entanglements with someone you see regularly in meetings was probably a bad idea but I did it anyway. Needless to say, it crashed and burned pretty horribly and now I often run into this person at my home group meetings (three meetings a week that I go to regularly). It’s very awkward seeing him and sometimes downright painful but I refuse to stop going to the meetings that got me sober.

971,"A week ago I relapsed after a half a year of sobriety under my belt. Throughout this time I began to find structure in my life, an inner peace began to develop and a stability I’d never encountered before while drinking. Passion for hobbies began to resurface. The feeling I chased in a bottle became the promise granted with sobriety. Heaven on earth wouldn’t be the way to describe sobriety; but even though the days felt longer and the temptation remained, it was worth it one hundred percent. 

When I relapsed, drinking felt different. I found that in comparison to the joy I found in daily life sober, the joy I found in strengthening relationships and putting my all into my work; being drunk just felt tiring. The feeling alcohol gave me felt synthetic, dulling my emotions and range of expression. Not to mention that afterwards I had nothing to show for it apart from an aching body and a looming cloud of depression.

I’m back on the bandwagon thankfully, going to meetings and taking it one day at a time. Though I will say this relapse was a huge reminder and positive affirmation, of why alcohol will be the devil I choose not to dance with.

Hi everyone. So I met a very sweet woman at AA a few days ago. She’s been super helpful with bringing me to meetings, introducing me to people and encouraging me but I feel like she’s also using me to vent and unload. She started gossiping about others who attend the same meetings as us. She talks a million words per minute and it really makes my anxiety go through the roof and I feel like it’s really damaging to my sobriety. It’s literally the entire ride to and from meets. Not a second less.

I really love that she’s kind and wants to help me. That she sees me as a person she can trust and open up to. But I feel like it’s just so she can complain to me and unload her problems/past traumas. I still have my things that I am trying my best to deal with sober and am only 8 days into this. I’m scared that this may eventually lead to my demise. I’ve been trying so hard to practice mindfulness and stay positive. And I’ve been doing great otherwise. People at the meetings tell me to stick with her. And I’m scared that if I tell her I can’t go with her anymore or tell her why that she’ll either just show up where I live, start drama or spread rumors about me at the meets or who knows what else. I don’t want to be the one to potentially trigger a relapse either. I don’t want to hurt her feelings and I get she’s also going out of her way to help me but my sobriety needs to come first for me. And I’m way too new to sobriety to be handling other people’s traumas like this. She’s told me way too much about her in the last few days and I’m still trying to cope with everything that has happened to me. Is this selfish of me? I know there’s a step that says to help others and that the program only works if you help others but I feel like I need to help myself first….

Has anyone been in this situation before? What should I do? I don’t want to offend or hurt anyone. But I need to continue this path without my peace being broken.

983,"Hi all. 

I’m a 26 year old woman and just had my first child in May. I remained sober my entire pregnancy for my son’s health but since giving birth, I’ve fallen right back into regular drinking. I’m a highly functional drunk, I’m capable of doing everything normally, speaking normally, and I never allow myself to breastfeed after more than the recommended limit of 1-2 glasses of wine. But once I breastfeed, I down a few more drinks to make the most of that time before I have to sober up again. (I do not endanger my son… for the most part, we bottle feed him). 

A few important notes: 

I and my husband both were raised by alcoholic mothers. I cared for my mother in my teenage years while she scream-cried for hours and pulled knives on me, slurred and stumbled, etc. My father gave up helping her, they separated and I was her caretaker. Then it was my baby brother when I left. She considers herself “well” now. And while she is happy and I enjoy being around her again, she very much is still a heavy drinker. 

I have attempted to quit before and I always manage to justify not continuing my streak. Usually it’s “I’ll only drink on the weekends” or “I’ll drink as much water as alcohol”, “I’ll only drink the seven drinks max limit”, etc. 

I am on heavy-ish medication. An anti-anxiety, an anti-depressant, and a beta blocker. 

I ALWAYS end up hating myself in the midst of drinking. Every. Fucking. Time. I get so pissed that I let myself drink as much as I did. Then once the headache goes away and I sleep it off, I manage to justify it all over again the next night. 

I saw a therapist for 5 years and she repeatedly told me she did not believe I had a problem, even though I regularly brought it up. She thinks I only feel out of control because I’m so scared to become my mother. 

But I never want to put my son through what I went through. I want to live a long, healthy life. Frankly, I’m terrified I’ve somehow already fucked up my body. 

I guess my question is this: how do you start, and HOW do you keep committed? I can’t seem to make quitting stick.",alcoholicsanonymous,hi 26 year old woman first child may remained sober entire pregnancy son health since giving birth fallen right back regular drinking highly functional drunk capable everything normally speaking normally never allow breastfeed recommended limit 12 glass wine breastfeed drink make time sober endanger son part bottle feed important note husband raised alcoholic mother cared mother teenage year screamcried hour pulled knife slurred stumbled etc father gave helping separated caretaker baby brother left considers well happy enjoy around much still heavy drinker attempted quit always manage justify continuing streak usually drink weekend drink much water alcohol drink seven drink max limit etc heavyish medication antianxiety antidepressant beta blocker always end hating midst drinking every fucking time get pissed let drink much headache go away sleep manage justify next night saw therapist 5 year repeatedly told believe problem even though regularly brought think feel control scared become mother never want put son went want live long healthy life frankly terrified somehow already fucked body guess question start keep committed seem make quitting stick

I'm particularly triggered lately because I'm thinking I need to rehome my dog. Every time I have gone to rehab, the hospital, or left town to help dying family, I have no one who can take proper care of him and I don't really know any services that are trustworthy. 

I get confused, frustrated, scared and sad whenever I think about anything like getting a job, having an apartment of my own, or trying to keep the program first.

Therapy really doesn't seem to be helpful at all. I can't help but think that I'm just lying to myself about the success of the program.

Where is the happy joyous and free life I've been promised? How does it slip away so frequently?

Hi everyone. I wanted to create this account and join this community to connect with others on the same journey as myself. Sorry that it’s kind of long. 
        I’ve been struggling with alcohol addiction for the better part of 15 years. I’m 30 now. It originally started as a way to cope with being bullied in school, body shaming, childhood trauma, physical/mental abuse at home and from a teacher, rape, being taken by DCYF due to skipping school, and just never quite fitting in no matter how hard I tried. I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I ended up staying back in school for two years and dropped out in the 8th grade as soon as I turned 16. I kept most of these issues bottled up and picked up smoking cigarettes, self harm, drinking and smoking pot with my few friends who were also “outcasts.” I finally felt like I belonged since we all did the same thing to numb the pain.  
       When I turned 17, I got a fake ID and started dancing to make enough to move out of my abusive home. I got my own place and thought I was queen of the world. Well, unfortunately that job just glorified drinking and drugging and sent me down an even worse path. I stopped self harm and smoking pot/cigarette but the drinking got much worse as it was just handed to me… I’d pound down shots and put myself in risky situations.. But the money was incredible and since all my peers were doing it and my employer encouraged it, I felt like I belonged. I knew it was getting into a problem when even they fired me for getting too drunk… I lost friends who were “party people” themselves. Cause I just couldn’t hold my liquor cause I was all or nothing. Having an eating disorder while drinking probably didn’t help. 
Anyways, this went on for years. I traveled to get away and any time anyone called me out on being a sloppy drunk, I got defensive and figured they were the problem. I felt like the whole world was against me. That they were the problem. When in reality, if you think everyone around you has a problem, you’re more than likely THE problem yourself. The only people I clicked with were those who would enable me and laugh when I got drunk but still hang out again. The ones who wouldn’t judge me and would feed my addiction.
I got so bad that I’d go out on dates just so someone could buy me drinks and get me drunk… Even if I just “Irish goodbyed” them after.  I’ve been hospitalized many times from passing out at bars or in public.. But I wouldn’t say it was cause I got drunk. I’d insist that I didn’t drink that much and that somebody must’ve drugged my drink. I lied despite knowing the truth even when I was pronounced dead for 20 seconds. 
Nothing stopped me… I thought I was so sly hiding bottles, burying cans under the trash so it would look like I drank less. Thinking I was holding my composure when I was a drunken mess… 
After all of this, I still never thought my problem was a problem. Last year I attended my first AA meeting. But I compared instead of identified. I didn’t take it seriously and despite staying sober for 2 months, as soon as my bday came around I thought I was cured and that I can just have one or two and be fine. What a joke that was. Sure the first few times I was able to but then I was like well if I can have two then I can probably have 3 and be fine too. Ha. 
It got worse and worse. I denied having a problem cause it wasn’t daily. I’d just binge about twice per week. My poor fiancé would come home from work and see me a drunken mess. 
But something hit me and hit me hard like a ton of bricks about a week ago. If I don’t get help, I’m going to die alone. He’s going to leave me. I’ll be stuck in this toxic cycle. And I cried for days thinking about it. Almost got suicidal. But then something told me I can’t give up. I can’t lose faith. That I am a great person when I don’t abuse alcohol. That I need help. 
That is when I swore on everything that I WILL (not just try) quit. I want to feel alive and have a purpose. I want a bright future. To have a family. A happy home. Instead of building a life like the one I grew up with and around. I deserve better. My family deserves better (even if they tried to enable me), and my fiancé deserves better. 
I’ve been attending zoom meets daily as well as in person meets. I met a friend at AA who takes me to live meetings daily and is as eager about sobriety and helps encourage me. I try to speak at every meeting to get over the mental block and thought that I NEED alcohol for people to accept me and to talk to others. I got two chips that I carry everywhere as a reminder. I quit my bar tending job to avoid sabotage, keep a journal that I write in twice per day, I keep positive messages around the house, meditate and have been practicing mindfulness. I even went out with a group of people from AA to dinner yesterday. For the first time, the voice in the back of my head that tells me to drink was nowhere to be found. It was amazing. To be able to smile, laugh, talk freely and be myself without using alcohol as a crutch like I did for 15 years….. I know it’s just the beginning but I feel blessed.. I feel like I’m on a path to finally break free from everything I once knew. I’ll finally be able to grow and create a beautiful life…. 

If you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read my story. Sharing this so openly was tough but I feel relieved and maybe my story will help someone else. Recovery is possible.

While on the road to recovery I received a gift that could not be purchased.  It was a card from my son in college, saying, 'Dad, you can't imagine how glad I am that everything is okay.  Happy Birthday, I love you.'  My son had told me that he loved me before.  It had been during the previous Christmas holidays, when he had said to me, while crying, 'Dad, I love you!  Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?'  I couldn't.  Choked with emotion, I had cried, but this time, when I received my son's card, my tears were tears of joy, not desperation.

1025,"So last week at work, my office had a caramel apple dip bar and later on I bit into a really hard spot that caused a filling to pop out. I immediately called my dentist and scheduled a filling replacement for yesterday. From Thursday to Sunday, I just felt sensitivity here and there but was fine otherwise. Just nursed my open filling until I came in. Then Monday morning I started feeling intense tooth and jaw pain. I called my dentist worried about it getting really bad and infected so they prescribed me antibiotics. 

My tooth and jaw was hurting REALLY bad and then yesterday when I finally got to the dentist, they took x-rays and found an even bigger problem. Turns out I had an abscess tooth in my front bottom left tooth but the pain was felt in my jaw and other teeth. Fortunately they don't have to extract it and just did a root canal, which relieved the pain as they drained all the pus. I asked my dentist if this happened from bad oral hygiene even though I brush twice a day and floss along with using mouth rinse. 

He said there was nothing I could have done and it's out of my control. But I'm thinking all those years of smoking, even though I quit last year, and occasional vaping might have been a contributing factor, even if they weren't a sole factor. I mean I never told my dentist that I smoked or vaped as I hid it from my family. And here's the thing. Even though it's been over a year since I quit, I would still buy vapes here and there or ask my friend for a few puffs. While vaping may not be as dangerous as cigarettes, it's still not good for you. I didn't vape all the time but the times I'd buy them, it'd be those cheap disposable vapes ranging from $8-20. Most of them have been pulled from the gas stations that sell them, probably for the best.

The gift is a lesson. A lesson that only you can unfold to yourself and learn from it and plan again your quitting date.   
Ask yourself why you smoked, under which circumstances, which pattern of thoughts lead you there, what did you lose by starting to smoke again (maybe confidence? what else?) and so on.   
Please make a list of it, write it down, better yet, make a post about it in this sub so others, like me, can know whether it is worth relapsing or not.

1072,"Hello!! 27(m) here, two packs a day smoker for 13 years. 

Today I will stop smoking again. 
I've been trying several times over the last two years and I always go a few days without and relapse back to smoking. 
Keep feeling bad about myself and with a strong depression and anxiety . 

Thats terrible! 

I would like to stop it for good!
I'm feeling really frustrated by the amount of failures, the time and effort I've been putting into being able to stop this damn addiction for the past two years. 

Im honestly believing that I will make it this time.
I have thrown away my packs of cigarettes about five times in the last month, but always go back to smoking. 
My monkey brain believes it can bring me benefits, such as relief from anxiety and depression. 

I rather deal with these feelings now. 

This drug war against myself seems to have been a huge waste of time in my life.
I'm having a relationship with alcohol that is slowly killing me aswell. 
Alcohol only makes me sick,  I hate being hangover and having no energy for anything at all the next day. Right now I'm drinking at least three times a week, blacking out every time.
Whiskey is my favorite drink. Need to cut it off aswell. 

Recently I've got prescribed for a medication, that will help with anxiety (trintellix).
That was my first time visiting a psychiatrist and I hope it works for me... 
I need this brain fix. 

If I dont stop now this will become more difficult over time and with more serious consequences for my health.
My mind and body are giving me THE SIGNAL to stop smoking.
Need to deal with this disease that sneaks up and makes me smoke and drink just to feel bad about myself and repeat the cycle of self-destruction. 

How do I stop this madness ? 

Denying the urge to smoke is necessary.
Letting the body detach from the substance and deal with withdrawal crises in the first few days, exercising, drinking plenty of water, good quality sleeping, eating healthy, meditation, breathing exercises.

That's a good place to start...

Please, feel free to add more things to my list of new habits!

Wish me luck.

I know I have the strength to leave this way of life now.

I’ve been here, time and time again. I know the risks of smoking. I know the addiction. I’ve smoked for quite some time. But I’m nervous. Here’s my story.

When I was 18, I moved in with my SO. I was still in high school, but I needed to escape my family. Constant threats from a homophobic step-father, always reminded I’m about to be kicked out and to not come home. I couldn’t take it. I left the day after my 18th birthday. My life continued to be challenging, but in new ways. But I thought I was in love. Then, my SO passed away. It tore me apart. How could I not know he was addicted to drugs? Was I that naive? I move back home and surrounded myself by those who actually loved me.

My mother was one of those people. She is a chain smoker. I picked up on the habit. What was I thinking? I hate that I did it. Now, 13 years later, I smoke way too much. I need this to end. My energy is low, my breathing is terrible, my happiness is out of reach. I quit previously for a year and a half. I know I can do it. But I’m still scared.

So my last cigarette was yesterday at 4:00 pm. I’m doing mostly well. I haven’t smoked. I’ve stayed busy. But I know the next couple of days will be tough. I can do it.

Thank you for listening. I needed to get some of this out. I’m committing to posting daily. I need accountability.

If anyone needs to work with someone to get this kicked to the curb, please feel free to reach out.

1112,"First, answer the question - can you get off the couch right now and run a marathon?

For most, the answer is no.

Because if you are not a professional, then your body is simply not ready for a marathon.

In order to do this, you must train for several months. Run farther and farther every day. Increase the load gradually.

Smoking is the same. Nicotine is embedded in our biochemistry as a neurotransmitter and the body is simply not ready to give it up.

We must gradually train our body to do without nicotine. Train him.

To do this, gradually, over several months, reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke per day. To do this, increase the interval between smoke breaks every day.

If you have problems with keeping track of the time, use special timer applications. I recommend SWay, or use the search term ""quit smoking gradually"".",stopsmoking,first answer question get couch right run marathon answer professional body simply ready marathon order must train several month run farther farther every day increase load gradually smoking nicotine embedded biochemistry neurotransmitter body simply ready give must gradually train body without nicotine train gradually several month reduce number cigarette smoke per day increase interval smoke break every day problem keeping track time use special timer application recommend sway use search term quit smoking gradually

1114,"30 years... It actually sounds wild when I really think about it.

Started off as so many of us do with joints/spliff etc and even though I stopped smoking weed about 10 years ago I have never managed to kick the tobacco. 

I stopped when I went to bed last night, timed it so that I'd have nothing left in the house when I woke up and resisted going to buy more today. Although I am on a nicotine spray to control any cravings. 

I've calculated that I would have had about 5 cigarettes so far today and I used to smoke 50g of tobacco in about 5 days.

I'm keeping my hands busy doing a run through of Dark Souls 3 and as long as I can keep focused on the game then I'm hoping that will distract me from thinking about tobacco.

TLDR: I don't smoke or vape, my friend offered to let me take a hit and never let me vape again. I want to know if the urges would be manageable if I only do it once and never do it again. 


My friend group is comprised of smokers and stoners but I don't touch the stuff. Yesterday my vaping friend has asked me if I want to try vape. He has been very clear that I can try it, and if I don't like it, he won't let me touch it again. He's aware that vaping is bad but he's too pessimistic to bother trying to quit himself. I've been considering it, and I figure that I should stop calling vaping nasty until I've done it myself. 


I doubt I'll like it, and I have complete faith that he would keep nicotine away from me if I got addicted or looked like I was going to. But I also have ADHD which means I have a higher chance of developing dependencies and addictions. 


So, if I do it once, will I go through a bad withdrawal? How bad would it be, and would I be able to go the rest of my life without vaping again?

I am a dental hygienist, and I am doing some research into the use of nicotine gum as a form of nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking. I just wanted to get some first-hand information from people who actually used nicotine gum as a means to quit smoking.

I want to know;

1. Did nicotine gum help you quit?
2. How long did you use nicotine gum for? Example: how many months or years did you use it for? 
3. Did you use any other products/methods to quit? Example: vaping, hypnosis

1127,"- Giving up’ - there is no sacrifice. Brainwashed. Only positive things. 
ESCAPING an addiction. 

- Are non smokers being deprived of something by not smoking? 

- You only smoke for the relief of withdrawal pangs which you created by continuing to smoke. There is no actual relief or boost. It fools you into thinking the opposite. 

- May be tempting to have just one more cigarette but it will start you off again and cost you £40.000 over the course of your life. 

- Every cigarette you light, you are closer to the bomb exploding. How do you know if it’s the next one?

- You won’t feel insecure about smoking. Think of when you walk with a cig and people are behind you

- You’ll have more energy!

- You’ll have more concentration 

- You will be able to respect yourself 

- You won’t be paranoid that you smell of stale smoke 

- Your breath will smell better and your teeth will become whiter 

- Your skin will improve 

- We assume we enjoy them only because we cannot believe we’d be so stupid to smoke if we didn’t enjoy them. 

- The enjoyment isn’t from the cigarette itself, it’s from ending the agitation caused by the craving 

- Cigarettes are enjoyable only after a period of abstinence 

- Smoking is a drug addiction 

- Cigarettes create the symptoms they relieve 

- On bad days remember smoking is not going to cure it. You’ll just feel shit for having started the chain again. 

- Cigarettes create the void. They don’t fill it. 

- Pangs are a craving for poison. It is the beast dying.

1128,"I started reading Alan Carr towards the end of last year, without any real intention to quit. By the time I got to the end, on the 2nd Jan, that was it, I was done, I threw away my tobacco and gave up, totally motivated. The year before I had quit a daily weed habit. 44 yo now, smoking tobacco daily since I was 16 ish, weed socially which also increased to a daily habit by the time I was in my early twenties (ironically, it was an ex girlfriend 'making' me give up tobacco, we lasted a day (less?), then naively thought smoking a spliff (with tobacco) was ok. stupid. three days later I got back on the tobacco with a newly found daily weed habit.)

fast forward 20 odd years and I hadn't gone an hour without smoking either, ok with some control over the weed, but pretty much. Something inspired me to give up weed in 2019, which was crazy difficult, but I managed, and at least had tobacco as a crutch to get me through. Quite a thing after being a little bit high (but mad productive tbf) for 20+ years. 

Anyway, after going a straight 6 months without weed, after 'mastering' the addiction of it, it would then be smoked very rarely, mostly socially, or with a drink at home, and was quite a creative, enjoyable thing, and that to me was fine, I kinda wanted to be able to enjoy it recreationally without being addicted to it. 

Then giving up tobacco (in rollie form) this year, arguably made a lot easier with lockdown, as socialising was minimal / non existent. Sometimes if I had a drink by myself, I would smoke a bit of pure weed, but never tobacco, and I was fine with that, I would return to totally non-smoking me the day after, so felt like I had it under control. Then at a friend's birthday a few months in, a friend shared a spliff with me, weed and tobacco, and wouldn't you know, it was the freaking sweetest thing ever, but nonetheless, I still maintained it as a social thing, kind of a one off, and didn't again for ages after. As lockdowns were lifted, and socialising more, so to would the smokes, sometimes with tobacco, but would only ever happen every few weeks, sometimes even less often and I was quite happy I could have a bit of fun, smoke some weed and tobacco, and return to non-smoking me for weeks after. This was the dream. 

However, eventually just smoking when I was out, turned to 'oh I'm a bit hungover, I'll have a smoke this morning', so once a week became the weekend, became 4 days and so on, and stupidly my rule was no rollies, only if there was a bit of weed involved, (because then i wasn't motivated by the tobacco).  One weekend I was working at a festival, a creative and quite a solitary experience, and out of nowhere I started smoking actual cigarettes ( i haven't smoked / liked actual cigarettes in freaking decades, just tobacco smoking, but had some old cigs with me to mix with the weed as I reasoned at least I wasn't carrying tobacco with me and would be less tempted to smoke tobacco by itself), but even after then I returned to most of the week not smoking.

I've totally lost it over the last couple of months, all kinds of excuses to smoke, and stupidest of all, 'well I'll just smoke a rollie, as I don't want to get high' &lt;facepalm&gt;. I saw it was a totally out of control,  daily thing again, gave up for three weeks, but then caved again, and have been smoking every day again for the last couple of weeks.

I've been away from home, (family holiday etc, 'ah a hotel room to myself, might as well smoke every day here!') but am about to return home tomorrow and hoping as that's where I successfully gave up, with all the new routines and habits I've developed to help me stay off it, I can again, though conversely, that can also be my place of zero restraint, which it has also been. 

Insomnia has been a big factor too, as nicotine and weed has gotten back into my system, it's been worse than ever, sleeping absolutely zero hours whenever I've had an early start, sometimes now for no reason at all (erm, hello! nicotin/weed withdrawal!??) and it was this happening at the beginning of the holiday that made me think eff it, smoke, better to 'enjoy' it and be able to sleep then be miserable on an expensive holiday I can't afford because of crazy insomnia. I am looking into hypno therapy and melatonin dosages for the insomnia. 

What worries me is that I don't seem to  have that motivation and drive I've previously had and been able to return to. Even when I did smoke, I knew I was going to return to non smoking me. but now.. 

I was SO proud of myself for giving up tobacco this year, as were my family. I really hope I can return to it, but equally now I can see I am hoping to return to not smoking 90% of the time, and just socially, but I've proof now of where this invariably leads.

Fast forward 10 years, I am now about to hit 26, and I've been in slow decline ever since. Underweight, hair thinning, and the worst of all stomach problems. Appetite gone to shit and upset stomach whenever I light one up. The stomach would get so bad that it made me develop social anxiety due to the fact that I'm constantly uncomfortable, yet I can't seem to be able to beat this fucking addiction. 

I've tried to turn my life around and pursue better health back in June, having quit caffeine. Probably sent my body in utter shock, anxiety, depression and I still feel like I haven't entirely recovered from it. It feels like a state of anhedonia and whenever I feel like I kicked the psychological caffeine withdrawal symptoms, I get hit with another wave of bad mood, to a point that I don't feel ready to battle nicotine. 

For the past two months I've tried to quit cold turkey, I can't seem to make it past day five. Brain fog, irritability, confusion, intrusive thoughts, I feel like it won't get better and I light up to alleviate the symptoms. 

All I need right now is some sort of reassurance. I really want to be free from this shit drug, I really want the energy back to be able to hit the gym and get back the confidence and self esteem that should've never left me to begin with.

1147,"I had cut down drastically since July this year.   First, I stopped buying cigarettes and started rolling smaller my own tiny cigarettes with a small filter.  That helped with the barrier of having to roll your own vs just grabbing one from the pack at any given moment.  Then I started rolling hemp spliffs (tobacco with hemp) which helped a lot with nausea and anxiety from nicotine withdrawal.  The most difficult thing was the depression and low energy/brain fog I was feeling which I took ginseng and St. John's wort for.  

Next, what happened was I got a dry herb vaporizer which I smoked mostly the hemp and barely any tobacco at all.  A dry herb vaporizer heats the tobacco at \~300C as opposed to combusting the tobacco at  900C degrees + , you get the nicotine but none the carbon monoxide and noxious smoke.   I was going to stop smoking altogether and just continue to vape.  But one day I accidently left the vape at someone's house and so I was craving nicotine.   I still had some rolling paper and loose tobacco and I so  I decided to roll my tobacco again, and then I also had this juul (an e-cigarette).. I was smoking normally as I would for about a few days, until couple of nights ago I definitely overdid it and smoked way too much nicotine than normally I would have vaped in one day and it also gave me really bad insomnia.  Ironically too much nicotine plus the lack of sleep made me feel like my heart was racing.  I had to take some blood pressure medication to feel alright.  Now when I look at the tobacco, it just makes me feel like it might take my heart out.  I really hope I do not pick up another cigarette again... 

It hasn't been a straight path of quitting/cutting down but I am on Day 2 of no nicotine now.  I feel like I'm getting a head cold and I'm very sleepy.   I am drinking a lot of chicken soup with ginger, ginseng (powder), turmeric and garlic... and lots of decaf chai/roobois tea--- its helping a little bit with the congestion.

This total divided between actual cigarettes from a pack, and daily spliffs (weed and loose tobacco mixed together). 

When the pandemic started, I cut out the cigarettes, but kept the spliffs. I tried switching to joints but it just didn’t hit the same (obviously…cause I was addicted to nicotine lol). When I started being able to see friends again, the cigarettes came back into my life, socially only. But I still smoked about 1/2-1 spliff each day on my own. It was how I winded down from work. 

A few weeks ago, my boss got Covid. I work in his home and was exposed. Weirdly, I also got an extremely intense respiratory illness, but I took two PCR Covid tests a few days apart within the recommended time frame, and both came back negative. It was the first time I had been sick in a long time. I coughed so hard that I threw up a few times, and burst the blood vessels in my eyes. 

Ever since then, my anxiety has been through the roof. Every time I cough, I think I’m gonna throw up. It has happened a couple times, though mostly I can cope it away (it’s coming from a mental place). I basically convinced myself I have lung cancer. And every night, my brain had a battle with itself. The addict part saying “You need to smoke. You have to. It’s what we do. You can’t skip it.” While the anxious part was saying “Please PLEASE don’t smoke tonight. You’re gonna make us throw up. You’re giving yourself cancer. Please I’m begging you to stop.” And it’s crazy how strong addiction is. It can overpower even the part of the brain that is literally trying to preserve your own current safety. I kept smoking these last few weeks, and would cough and feel sick, and the cycle was just fucking ridiculous. 

But five days ago, something finally clicked. All of a sudden, the part of my brain that doesn’t want to feel nauseous every day from coughing finally defeated the addict voice. I got home and looked at my spliff rolling stuff, and just thought to myself “God dammit, enough is ENOUGH!!! You don’t even enjoy this anymore, stop fucking doing it!!!” And admittedly, it’s not like I did some amazing healthy thing that night. I just laid on my bed and watched YouTube and tiktoks mostly. But as I did that I was like “wow, this doesn’t even feel that different than when you smoke.” Because my tolerance is so low from a decade of daily spliffs, you know? 

And I got through an entire workweek smoking nothing. No spliff, no cigarette, not even a joint or something. And each day, my anxiety lessened. I no longer felt like breathing was causing me to need to throw up. 

I finally fucking did it. 

I have a lot more I could say about my relationship with food and how smoking weed plays into that, but suffice it to say: while I struggled pretty bad with that early in the week, I’ve improved greatly and have been eating closer to a normal amount in the evenings. The daily calorie count is still far too low, but it’s okay, I’ve got plenty of extra weight on me to get me through, lol. And I’m taking vitamins. All this is so much better than the zone-out binges I was having after smoking every night. 

I have energy, I can breathe, I worked out three times this week and didn’t feel sick after. I just turned 30 and while I’m a bit disappointed in myself for letting this plague my 20s, I think I’m still early enough in my life that like…this is pretty good. It all feels very hopeful right now.",stopsmoking,fifth day without tobacco overall greatly reduced past year used smoke 4 cigarette day work day probably like 68 weekend total divided actual cigarette pack daily spliff weed loose tobacco mixed together pandemic started cut cigarette kept spliff tried switching joint hit obviously cause addicted nicotine lol started able see friend cigarette came back life socially still smoked 121 spliff day winded work week ago bos got covid work home exposed weirdly also got extremely intense respiratory illness took two pcr covid test day apart within recommended time frame came back negative first time sick long time coughed hard threw time burst blood vessel eye ever since anxiety roof every time cough think gonna throw happened couple time though mostly cope away coming mental place basically convinced lung cancer every night brain battle addict part saying need smoke skip anxious part saying please please smoke tonight gonna make u throw giving cancer please begging stop crazy strong addiction overpower even part brain literally trying preserve current safety kept smoking last week would cough feel sick cycle fucking ridiculous five day ago something finally clicked sudden part brain want feel nauseous every day coughing finally defeated addict voice got home looked spliff rolling stuff thought god dammit enough enough even enjoy anymore stop fucking admittedly like amazing healthy thing night laid bed watched youtube tiktoks mostly like wow even feel different smoke tolerance low decade daily spliff know got entire workweek smoking nothing spliff cigarette even joint something day anxiety lessened longer felt like breathing causing need throw finally fucking lot could say relationship food smoking weed play suffice say struggled pretty bad early week improved greatly eating closer normal amount evening daily calorie count still far low okay got plenty extra weight get lol taking vitamin much better zoneout binge smoking every night energy breathe worked three time week feel sick turned 30 bit disappointed letting plague 20 think still early enough life like pretty good feel hopeful right

1169,"This might sound like common sense, but before I quit smoking. I used to say that I liked the social aspect of smoking and how it'd go hand in hand with drinking. Sure, those parts may have been enjoyable at the expense of the other times. 

Some of the things I don't miss about nicotine addiction is when I'd run out of smokes and then fighting the urge to buy a pack despite costing $14-17, only to cave in and do it. Or the other times I'd be at work and if I didn't have any of my own cigarettes, I'd go out of my way to offer someone a dollar for a cigarette, which I felt pathetic doing. 

Then there'd be times where I'd get irritable if I had to hide my smoking habit from parents, dates, and other people that would approve of it and look forward to them leaving so I can have a cigarette. I wouldn't vocalize it but internally I'd be craving really hard. 

When you don't smoke, you just don't think about these things and it's truly liberating. For example, when I get off work, I just look forward to going home and winding down and watching tv as opposed to ""needing"" a cigarette before I go home. I didn't use Allan Carr's book to quit but having read some parts after I quit only reaffirms my decision to quit. 

My biggest takeaway is to not envy smokers or miss it. When someone smokes, they are looking to bring themselves to a state that non-smokers are always at, and it couldn't be any more true. Not to mention that using nicotine, of any kind, only increases cravings not reduce them. It's foolish to think otherwise.",stopsmoking,might sound like common sense quit smoking used say liked social aspect smoking itd go hand hand drinking sure part may enjoyable expense time thing dont miss nicotine addiction id run smoke fighting urge buy pack despite costing 1417 cave time id work didnt cigarette id go way offer someone dollar cigarette felt pathetic thered time id get irritable hide smoking habit parent date people would approve look forward leaving cigarette wouldnt vocalize internally id craving really hard dont smoke dont think thing truly liberating example get work look forward going home winding watching tv opposed needing cigarette go home didnt use allan carrs book quit read part quit reaffirms decision quit biggest takeaway envy smoker miss someone smoke looking bring state nonsmoker always couldnt true mention using nicotine kind increase craving reduce foolish think otherwise

1171,"Hey y'all, first post here. Just posting because well.. I quit four days ago and I was supposed to start work two hours ago and have been struggling through the nicotine-related blocks. I'm just writing to get this off my chest and share with the community because there's nobody else in my life that understands. 

It's not right to call them cravings, I think. Its also not quite right to call it withdrawal. I've been smoking for ten years since I was 16. Before and after every class from Junior year of high school through college and work since. Mostly cigarettes in high school, then working with a hookah at my desk 8+ hours a day through college, to mostly 5% - 6% salt nic vapes for the past two, three years, which - had the advantage of being able to hit virtually non-stop during the day.

 Before I started using nicotine, I was using cannabis for another 2/3 years  before that and have since used it continuously as well. 

Between the two... I feel like my brain literally doesn't know how to function in ""everyday reality"" without them. Every few moments is spent trying to release this deep-seated panic like my brain has to be re-trained to deal with baseline reality when nicotine has been my entire coping mechanism. Not even for anything specific, but in contrast to any degree of self-regulation. 

I don't think I'm about to fail. I know this release and re-training is a path to a kind of liberation. But god damn. This is more than just putting something down. This is more than ""just"" an addictive habit. This is fucking full-scale cognitive restructuring in either direction, right down to our most basic physiological habits of breath and sympathetic nervous system activation. I feel like I need a whole-ass month-long retreat just to learn how to breath and function like a normal human being again. 

In the meantime.. I guess I'll do a shitty job on work and hope I get better with my breathwork in the near future. Best of luck and best of wishes to everybody struggling, processing, or even just thinking of quitting out there in the community. Love for all.",stopsmoking,hey yall first post posting well quit four day ago supposed start work two hour ago struggling nicotinerelated block im writing get chest share community there nobody else life understands right call craving think also quite right call withdrawal ive smoking ten year since 16 every class junior year high school college work since mostly cigarette high school working hookah desk 8 hour day college mostly 5 6 salt nic vapes past two three year advantage able hit virtually nonstop day started using nicotine using cannabis another 23 year since used continuously well two feel like brain literally doesnt know function everyday reality without every moment spent trying release deepseated panic like brain retrained deal baseline reality nicotine entire coping mechanism even anything specific contrast degree selfregulation dont think im fail know release retraining path kind liberation god damn putting something addictive habit fucking fullscale cognitive restructuring either direction right basic physiological habit breath sympathetic nervous system activation feel like need wholeass monthlong retreat learn breath function like normal human meantime guess ill shitty job work hope get better breathwork near future best luck best wish everybody struggling processing even thinking quitting community love

And it fucking sucks. I've had this headache for 2 days that won't go away and usually migraines are easy to get rid of with water, but not this time.

1268," Hello All, I have been smokers for past 6 years and I tried to quit cigarettes so many times and every time I do I fail and I wonder why? So 4 months back, I wanted to quit again and decided to log my whole journey so I used to log trigger and time when I smoke and over the the weeks data I see clear pattern and my mind was more aware of pattern and triggers, so after a week I decided I will try to distract myself with different techniques(dancing, drinking water, talking to friend, breathing exercise etc..), initially first week 80% of time my cravings were much powerful then my mind ... but I was keep doing and exercising the same practice and target one trigger at time( eg: I will not smoke after any meeting ) and overtime I realise that my mind is more and more aware of my habit that helps me to make my judgement to smoke or not on certain trigger... after couple week of practicing the same I was manage to smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day to 1-2 cigarette a day and now I smoke occasionally. And I thought what helps me can help others as well to control smoking, so I started building app for that cause, in first app version I am supporting below features

1. set daily smoking goal 
2. log every smoke with triggers 
3. analyse your trend - trigger wise, day wise and will provide you comparison based on past data  
   
  So anybody want's to give initial feedback to this android app? please comment if you want to test it out this app :)

1307,"A realization I've had is that quitting smoking is all about the mindset.

Let me clarify:

You can use Nic patches, or any other type of Nic replacement. You can switch to vaping, you can use gum. Etc... The point is, those are all substitutes. Even if you're just chewing a mint gum, that's a substitute: one habit for another. You're not kicking the habit, you're just satisfying it in a different way.

To draw an analogy, your kid really wants McDonalds. He's throwing a tantrum, wants a cheeseburger *RIGHT NOW*. You can't get him McDonalds. Instead, you make him a cheeseburger at home.

In that sense, you didn't kick his habit of wanting McDonalds. He'll still want McDonalds. You just patched it with something he doesn't want but will quiet him for a bit, until the next day when he throws another tantrum for McDonalds. And it will be an endless cycle. 

Similarly, you aren't kicking the habit when you substitute it for a piece of gum or seeds. On a good day, it will distract you. On a bad day, it will aggravate you more. At the end of the day, you're still living under the shadow of a cigarette. You're under the mercy of a cigarette, and how much you can control yourself for that single craving.

Multiple that by however many cigarettes you smoked in a day. 

---

What I'm getting at is, then you start tallying up. You start keeping count. *Okay today I fought off 15 urges. Tomorrow, I will have fought off 30 urges. A week from now, I'm a week smoke free.*

Your life **revolves** around the cigarette, your cravings, and your resistance. You took a habit that was a big deal to you, and made it into an even bigger deal after you tried to quit it. Hence, you're still a slave to it, even after you stopped it. 

---

On the other hand, you hear about and see people who were a pack a day or more smokers for 10, 20 years. And suddenly, they dropped it. No visible withdrawals, no keeping tally. You ask them when they stopped, they couldn't tell you the exact date. But They just know it was a while ago. Hell, some might even pick a cigarette once in a blue moon because they're out on a vacation at a bar or something. But they're no more of a smoker than anyone else, and they won't fall back into it.

Even smoker mothers, who get pregnant. They drop smoking in a heartbeat, and don't think twice about it. Again, because of priorities. 

This has nothing to do with ""addictive personality"" or any of that. It comes down to one thing:

their mindset shifted. They had other priorities come up. Maybe they just didn't want to smoke anymore. Maybe they suddenly had a baby. Maybe they met someone. Maybe they had a stroke. And in that sense, smoking was no longer a priority or even a thought. Smoking because so minuscule that they didn't even think about it. They didn't keep a tally, they didn't fight off an urge. They just moved on, because they had more important things.

Today marks 3 weeks since I stopped smoking. I'm on 25mg patch and sometimes I miss smoking.

I'm glad I didn't but sometimes I feel like I want to, I somehow miss it even though life is better now, no more anxiety over how many cigarettes I have left or other things, I have more time to do things I love and to talk to loved ones. 

I was a smoker for 2 years and by the end of it, I used to smoke around 20 cigarettes per day. Sometimes even 1 pack and a half or 2. I've may even got acid reflux or maybe GERD because of smoking since the last two months I've been having problems with acid returning to my throat.

1319," I’m an independent touring musician, and make my living playing shows most nights. I’ve been a cigarette smoker for about a year and a half, a habitual weed smoker for around five years, and a fairly regular drinker for at least the last three years. I take prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, which I started during the pandemic when I was in a particularly low place. One of the guys I tour with quit cigs with me two weeks ago, and we’re going strong on the no-cigs front, but here’s where I could really use some advice: 

I’m struggling to find a healthy way to cope with the extra anxiety that comes from nicotine withdrawals - I keep leaning on other vices more to push past the urge to buy a pack of cigarettes. I’m smoking more weed, drinking more, and overeating every night. 

I play a lot of brewery/bar gigs so alcohol is always free and easily accessible and I’ve already noticed myself drinking more at shows to take the edge off that I’d usually rely on nicotine to take care of. Yesterday, I opted not to drink during the show and I felt so restless when I got home - couldn’t sleep, walked for an hour, tried to get some work done - I ended up caving and getting stoned to calm down. I want to find balance and distance myself from all the shitty vices I’m leaning on. Do you have any suggestions for quitting nicotine without shifting the weight of your personal discomfort to other addictive things? Thank you!

1321,"It's late, I'm depressed, full of nicotine and I desperately want to quit. 
I have horrible anxiety already and the additional anxiety around my health and the way I smell, am perceived etc. is too much to take. 
Tobacco is absurdly expensive in Australia and I'm wasting my money on something that is going to kill me   and is worsening my physical capabilities. 
I'm young and I don't want to keep putting it off because ""I've got time"". I don't want to be digging my own grave any more. 

I am done. I'm ready to get rid of this shit no matter what. I previously read Alan Carr's book and it was like an actual switch being flipped. I quit for a year until a particularly bad break up. I had that first puff and the work was all undone. I didn't even crave the nicotine, I just wanted something to fill the empty space. 

Does anyone have suggestions/tips for how to replace the one thing I think a cigarette gives me - a way to passively kill time? It doesn't require focus, my thoughts can still bounce around without taking away from the task at hand and there's a clear beginning and end, kind of a goal to  complete. It's satisfying when I'm by myself and anxious, not really able to collect my thoughts and it gives me something to lean on socially when I'm nervous (either to kind of stimulate myself or to act as a social buffer? I don't know how to explain it). 
Things like stress balls or fidgetty things don't work because they're aimless and also usually socially inappropriate. 

It would also be great to hear from anyone that's had success re reading the Easy Way to Quit. 

TLDR; what are some alternatives to filling empty space? Especially ways that will still work in a social situation where I can't just whip out my phone and start watching YouTube.

He is now two weeks quit and perhaps two weeks from coming home with physical limitations (i.e. won't be getting outside for smoke breaks) and will be out of work for perhaps a year (i.e. budget is going to get very tight).

He feels pretty okay on the non smoking aspect of things.

In the summer of 2019 I smoked around 4 packs a day, and today on average I vape four juul pods per day ( I dont use juul but thats the best way to quantify vape use imo ). 

Bottom line is that with recent federal legislation even vaping is astronomically expensive now. While I think its ridiculous we vilify vaping so much, I'm pretty much left with no choice but to quit. Partly because I dont want to allocate more per month to nicotine than I already spend, and partly because it pisses me off that congress can just control my life and what I consume.

My biggest hurdle is probably obvious to you by now, but I genuinely dont care about the negatives of smoking. I still love everything about it, even if I know that objectively I will benefit from not using it.

I dreamt I woke up on a beach, took in a big breath of fresh air, and looked out at the water, which was shimmery pink and blue, it was sunrise. I got up and walked along the shoreline, I walked along a pier, and said how I really felt like going swimming. I started back along to the beach, and said how I love not smoking and how I love the mornings now. I felt joyful, saw a child playing, thought how beautiful everything was. (Weirdly my ex was there the whole time and I was talking to them, I've only had bad dreams about them before but they didn't disrupt the peace of it at all, they just followed me around, felt calm for them to be there). 

Then I woke up irl, and immediately got out of bed and went for a jog, without having to force myself at all, I really wanted to and had a bunch of energy. I did the same today.

1357,"Hi folks!  You might remember me.  I posted back when I initially quit.   

I quit in early August, not a single cig in over two months.   I am currently battling cancer and after discovering I am peeing blood again, when I shouldn't be, I got weak and bought a pack.  I smoked about half the pack, and I feel really ashamed of myself.

I am 60 with bladder cancer.  After having my tumors removed, my doctor scoped me again and noticed some ""pieces"" that he missed.  Now I am scheduled to have that same operation again.  First time I had complications and actually had to cath myself a few times.  The idea of doing that all again...  Anyway, at work yesterday I noticed I was peeing blood again, which should not be happening since I was ""healing so well"" according to the doc.  I went home early from work and started my leave early, since my operation is in a few days.

I don't consider myself ""starting back"".  Now that I have calmed down from my initial panic, I am like ""damn, what have I done? Did I REALLY just start again after going through all that to quit?"".  I am not gonna let this beat me.  I am NOT letting cancer have me, I will NOT let cigarettes' get me either.  

It is just hard and depressing.   Really don't have anyone to talk to about it either.  My co-workers are friend-like, but mostly just acquaintances.  All of my blood relatives have already died, my lifelong friends (only really only had two) are both dead....   My wife is a drunk and I ""think"" somewhere in there she cares, too busy being self absorbed to worry about me.  But, for her part, I understand, her Mom is suffering from dementia and she is her care giver.  She has toned down the drinking and is trying to take care of her, so I don't give her any crap.

There were two or three periods during those 30-years that I quit: one time for 2 years, another time for 5 years and a few other times for 6-months. Yesterday I had a full physical exam which included a lung test. The test result was very positive and indicated that my lung functioning was that of someone 5-years younger. That was surprising news considering how long I smoked. 

Today—almost out of nowhere—I developed a persistent dry cough that is somewhat annoying. I have no other symptoms. I don’t have a cold, and I seriously doubt it’s any type of virus. My question for this (very experienced) community is, did any of you experience the onset of coughing symptoms weeks after quitting? What was your experience and how did you manage through it?

1379,"Hello everyone, 

I've previously stated that I was going to post weekly for three months in my Past posts.   


[Introductory](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/)

&amp;#x200B;

And then I stopped. The reasons I stopped were that I got insanely busy at work and didn't have a lot of time off, but mostly it's that I just don't even think about smoking anymore. To sit here and write these posts is something that would have to be scheduled these days or I just won't get around two doing it. It's wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

My Ferrari Fund is now over $1000, I will certainly be getting one at some point in the future thanks to cigarette money saved. Still a ridiculous concept to me that not smoking can pay for a supercar over 15 or so years. But on the other hand, last year had someone told me that, it probably wouldn't have mattered. When I was a smoker, the idea of being a non-smoker actually seemed way more unattainable than a supercar. I'd always be able to afford one of those some day, although I'd neevr buy one without a fund set up for it like this. But not smoking? That seemed like a fantasy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now though, I am a non-smoker. I don't think about it at all, I'm not tempted to have a smoke during all the natural cues I used to have (After food, first thing in the morning with coffee, commercial breaks, in the car, during intermissions.... I used to smoke constantly, all of these cues are really just excuses). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to promise to keep writing these because I probably won't, but I can't express my gratitude to this sub enough for recommending Allen Carr. I learned so much about my addiction and the lies/delusions it was telling me. Smoking consumed me and didn't let go for all of those years. It feels so good having my life and mind back from that awful, awful disease. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I can quit, and get to this point of not needing, or even wanting a cigarette, anyone can. And I'm serious, I wouldn't take a puff of a cigarette if paid $10000 right now. I don't want to be a smoker ever again.  It's just a matter of finding the right tools that work for you. I wish I'd have found Allen Carr sooner because that was instant to me. It really was easy to quit with those tools. I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it. Get the audiobook, grab your smokes, and listen to it all in one shot. Just set aside 5 hours of your day and you'll easily stop smoking. At least that's how it worked for me.

1391,"***It wasn't easy but I did it!***   


Quick background: got addicted when I was in 6th grade and smoked a pack a day for 10 years.   


 Anyhoo, I've decided that it was time to quit this year as I wanted to be able to see my future daughter grow and go to college and whatnot. So I started with a Juul which went well and I was able to kick it off completely after 3 days or so but after a while, I've realized that my nicotine addiction got more intense and I was consuming more nic than I was w normal cigs, so I switched to freebase juice (lower nic levels) with a pod mod device.  


After that point, I've decided to gradually decrease my nicotine intake until it's 0mg, and I was able to decrease it to 3mg in 2 weeks but then I realized the flavor had played a big role in why I vaped too much juice in a day, so I've ordered a special juice that had no flavor in it. It was a bit weird but I got used to it and reduced my daily vaping amount by half.  After that, I was convinced that I was pretty close to quitting completely very soon.   


In the meanwhile, my Doctor had put me on a new medication called ""Wellbutrin XL"" for my ADHD treatment. I've started taking it and after 3 days or so, it was a Thursday afternoon, I just had my lunch and I've noticed that it's been more than 6 hours since the last time I took a hit from my vape and was pretty amazed by the fact that I didn't even think about it during that time.   


So I quickly reached for my vape to take a hit and just thought to myself, ""why don't you wait and see how much longer you can go vape-less?"" and I liked the idea so I put it back.  And BINGO, that was the last time, months had passed and I've never touched it again. Threw all my vape and smoking stuff away and never looked back.   


All that process that I've just told you about took me about a month and a half, from starting to Juul until having my last vape drag. But that doesn't mean that you can do it in 1.5 months as well, I was pretty aggressive and fast about it so it didn't take me long but it's different for everyone.",stopsmoking,wasnt easy quick background got addicted 6th grade smoked pack day 10 year anyhoo ive decided time quit year wanted able see future daughter grow go college whatnot started juul went well able kick completely 3 day ive realized nicotine addiction got intense consuming nic w normal cigs switched freebase juice lower nic level pod mod device point ive decided gradually decrease nicotine intake 0mg able decrease 3mg 2 week realized flavor played big role vaped much juice day ive ordered special juice flavor bit weird got used reduced daily vaping amount half convinced pretty close quitting completely soon meanwhile doctor put new medication called wellbutrin xl adhd treatment ive started taking 3 day thursday afternoon lunch ive noticed 6 hour since last time took hit vape pretty amazed fact didnt even think time quickly reached vape take hit thought dont wait see much longer go vapeless liked idea put back bingo last time month passed ive never touched threw vape smoking stuff away never looked back process ive told took month half starting juul last vape drag doesnt mean 15 month well pretty aggressive fast didnt take long different everyone

1393,I quit smoking for 5 months and tonight i got drunk with my friends at party and smoked about 5 6 cigs .. Please give some advice,stopsmoking,quit smoking 5 month tonight got drunk friend party smoked 5 6 cigs please give advice
1394,"I started vaping in 2018. Starting in 2020 I tried to stop several times - most attempts lasted a few weeks before I would get triggered (usually by drinking socially with friends who use nicotine). This most recent time I decided to use nicotine pouches to help quit. I think the hardest part for me was the hand-to-mouth habit, so I figured I would try to break that without dealing with nicotine withdrawal on top of it. I started at 6mg pouches using three per day and over a couple of weeks tapered down to one 3mg pouch daily until a month ago when I stopped completely. It was pretty easy and after a couple of days I didn’t really think of it or miss smoking or nicotine at all. However, the past two days it’s been all I can think about and the urge to go buy a disposable vape is almost unbearable. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or has any advice to help get through this part without relapsing again? 

I should also add that I just made a cross country move.

I made a quit plan two years ago, where I would go down by one cigarette every day over a month, and that failed miserably.  Also I was following a website that talked about nicotine as the NicoDemon!  I liked it at first, but then I don't know what happened. I get so confused about websites, and quit sites, that it just made me want to go have another cigarette.

The first week is horrible. The addiction makes sure of that. It tries to trick you into ""just one more smoke"", and everything is just aggravating and not fun. BUT that one week at the beginning is worth everything else that follows.

\--

By my second week I remember getting in my boyfriend's car after he picked me up and turning to him; ""Wow you smell really nice today!"" I said, ""Are you wearing cologne?""

And he replied, ""I am. I wear it every day. I always wondered if you liked it.""

This floored me. Cigarettes stole my ability to smell how amazing my boy smelt. And within the first two weeks I was able to get that back. And that experience set the tone for the rest of my quitting experience.

1402,"Hello! Just found this subreddit. I was addicted to cigarettes for a couple years, I smoked a pack a day for maybe a year, cut down a lot by rolling my own and vaping, and eventually fully quit sometime last year. I've bought a couple packs since then, usually smoked part of it, remembered how shitty it feels, and gave the rest away. 

I work at a restaurant and many of my coworkers smoke or vape and would offer me some. At first I didn't  see an issue with it but now I'm stuck with this problem/habit where for many months, I smoke almost like I'm addicted to it Friday- Sunday when I work (I do doubles all weekend and then get 4 days off lol) where on a ""good day"" I'll only have one cigarette but sometimes up to like 4 or 5 especially if I drink which we can do for free there when we close. And then go through withdrawals every Monday Tuesday and Wednesday, but my bf smokes cigarettes and recently I've been bumming some from him on those days and been close to being fully physically addicted again a couple times and made myself stop for a week or so before inevitably bumming more. 

I have no mental issue with going days/a week without nicotine if I'm not around it, I've done it very often. But I recognize the amount I'm still smoking negatively affects me almost every day and I've tried every strategy I know of to stop. I set up reward systems for going without for a week/2 weeks/a month, I journaled about how it makes me feel, I got hemp cigarettes, I told people not to offer to me. And even then I can't stop myself from asking at least my bf (we work together) at least once a day when I work.

1407,"Nearing the 96 hour mark and this is the closest to quitting I have gotten in a while! I keep trying and keep failing, and every time I failed I said the same words ""just 1 smoke."" There was never just one. One quickly turns to two, two to three, and before I know it I'm at a pack a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember the first cigarette I smoked. It was 2018 and I was my first week into med school. We were celebrating with some drinks and my roommate pulled out a pack of cigarettes. I had never smoked cigarettes in my life, never wanted to do it neither. Whenever someone offered I would say ""no thank you"" and usually leave because I couldn't stand the smell of cigarettes. However, while a tad bit too tipsy I took a cigarette and lit it up. And oh man that rush that gets you the first time...it was incredible. Weeks went by and I smoked a cigarette here and there, nothing too serious, but then came the end of our first semester...exams were nearing, stress was high and I needed a damn smoke...and then another one....and then, of course, another one. Quickly in a matter of weeks I started smoking a pack a day till the end of that semester.

  
Then came my first break, had about a week off before next semester started and in that week I managed to quit. Barely touched another cigarette for the next 7 months, even my smoker friends would say ""No"" even when I'd repeatedly bother them for one. Then came fourth semester! The start of 2nd year with the largest hurdle over (1st year, particularly 3rd semester). I was at an all time high, stress was at an all time low, things were looking up! And then I thought, ""well damn, a cigarette would be good right now."" 

And that's where the next 2.5 years of my life went downhill with smokes. Now I wasn't smoking because I was stressed, I was smoking because I was happy! In a fantastically idiotic fashion it meant I was smoking all the time for every possible reason! Again, within a few weeks I was at a pack a day! At least this time I had thought of an alternative. I was going to get a vape! I got some Juul with pods and started tossing those back 2 - 3 pods a day. It was great because I didn't have to leave my room to hit a Juul like I had to with a cigarette so I could just do it every minute of every day! Wake up in the morning and still in bed? Juul. Taking a shit? Juul. About to jump into the shower? Juul! Juul, juul, juul all the time. 

And this kept up for the remainder of my 2nd year with really no attempts to quit. At times I went back to cigarettes. The feeling of lighting one up and taking the first puff. The delicious taste of ash in my mouth. I'm honestly not quite sure what it is, but there was just something about smokes that vapes just could not replicate.

My 3rd year though was where my eyes opened and I made several attempts, and of course, failed every time. 3rd year is when the game changes a bit. It's no longer locked in the library or in your room studying. No, now you're on the floor, working, interacting with patients and their families. I ran into a few attending physicians that smoked, you could smell them a mile away when they came back from their ""break"".  I wanted a break. I took my breaks. Cigarette in the morning after waking up, before I showered to be sure I didn't smell before I got to the hospital. Cigarette after morning rounds, didn't want my residents and attendings to get a whiff. Cigarette after lunch. Cigarette on my way home. Cigarette here, cigarette there, cigarettes everywhere! 

Saw my patient dying of COPD exacerbation? ""Damn I could use a smoke after that..."" Patient with COPD and COVID has their heart stop in the ICU and I had to do chest compressions? ""Fuck I need a smoke."" How does that make sense? I don't know, you tell me...

It's like there are these little cigarette monkeys in my head that start running around whenever they get a chance. I had always thought quitting was ""easy"". ""I just have to stop,"" I would say. I can start using smokeless tobacco like snuff pouches to wean myself down. I even tried that, went from using 1 8mg pouch every so often, to popping 2x6mg pouch every now and then (somehow managed to up the dose see? 8 just wasn't cutting it! And before I knew it I would be popping pouches while smoking cigarettes or hitting a vape. 

But don't worry. ""It's easy."" 

""It's easy."" Is the worst thing I have ever told myself about anything. Ever since 3rd year ended a few weeks ago I have had a lot of time to sit and think. It seems almost universally true in my life that when I say ""it's easy"" I get lazy. ""Losing and keeping weight off is easy!"" Proceeds to put on 30 lbs. ""Putting on muscle is easy!"" Proceeds to slack at the gym and atrophy like nobody's business. ""Damn this class is really easy"" Proceeds to get lazy and by some heavenly blessing still manage to do well. 

""Easy"" is the worst word I had ever learned. Nothing is easy. This time I have convinced myself that this is one of the hardest things I will ever do. I need to quit and to do that I need to stay vigilant. No lapses, no relapses. If not for myself then for my patients.

I keep telling myself I won't have any, and I'm okay most of the time, but maybe once a week I'll falter and won't be able to talk myself out of buying a pack. I rationalize it by telling myself that I'm stressed out, that it helps manage my anxiety, that it gives me something to do with my hands, or that it helps me socialize (the introvert's crutch, am I right? What better excuse is there to leave the room for ten minutes to prevent getting overwhelmed?). Then I wake up in the morning feeling like garbage and vowing to really quit this time... rinse and repeat. I'm really doing my best to turn my life around and I could use some support.

Tried a few different strategies such as quitting at night. Quitting in the morning. Quitting during the day. Quitting on the patch or lozenge. Quitting while I am off work. Quitting while I am working. I am on champix now. I tried it years ago and it felt like it worked. Like I didnt feel like smoking but did anyways because I wasnt ready to quit. Ive been on it for 2 weeks today and it doesnt feel as helpful as before. Like it kind of makes me forget about smoking but theres still mad cravings every so often.

Like youre supposed to pick a quit date within 2 weeks of champix and im there now and am worried it will not work if I keep smoking.

Im trying to have that make sense with smoking but it seems like its all about how many days it is equals your success. I dont know if that makes any sense. Alcohol for me was an acute disease. Absolutely binge drinking wrecklessness that could of killed me or anyone else in my path at any time. Smoking is this chronic addiction that takes a little bit at a time but isnt as near term devastating as alcohol is. So it almost doesnt seem ""that bad"" or that I must quit sooner than later even though I want to. Enough is enough.

I have learned a lot in my 3 days as a non smoker. My triggers are strong when there are some stuff in my life I find emotionally hard to deal with. Its so easy to not face my problems and grap a smoke instead and numb my feelings out. 

The other trigger is when I'm happy. When I do a task or get some good news in my ways i tend to celebrate it with a smoke. I am aware now more than ever that I have some serious work to do regarding behaving my urges.

Luckely i figured out that I don't need to smoke so often, my gravings mostly happens when I go to bed, so that's the area I need to focus on the most. I did feel much more happy these past days, so I can deffenly see a future of me not smokeing some day.

 After work I went to the pharmacy and picked up the patch. I was hesitant due to the patch being 21 mil but the pharmacist told me because of how regular I vape going the strongest would be my best option. These are 24 hour patches. I put one on and within an hour I had an intense buzz that was dizzying and cotton mouth like I had never had. I'm about 6 hours in and I can't sleep and I'm salivating to the point I'm having to spit and drink lots of water to wash it down.

1543,"I know its not a round number. But just wanted to share my progress. I have joined this community today. i have read lot of posts. Im so glad that I could join because i can see lot common problems we ex smokers face and lot of inspiration and encouragement from people who could kill this addiction for good. 

I have smoked for 10 years and most recent  rate of smoking was like two packs for three days. 

Since last year i was on a successful journey of quitting smoking stayed close to 5 months out of smoking 2020 june to December. And picked it up again and on and off couple of times. And stopped on my 32nd birthday 19th of 2021 and going on being a happy non smoker ever since.  Just 29 days. But every quit attempt counts and yeah there will be pangs and cravings but we should become bigger than the addiction. Trying to be conscious about my thoughts which immensely helps me on control acting automatically on usual queues which leads me to go and buy a pack.

somedays it gets rough and really tough, fighting with my own thoughts. But if some how I managed to overcome the temptation to smoke the next day it feels like a victory and make me feels like the next time its gonna be a lot  easier to neglect cravings and continue living happily .

thats all i got to say so for now. Wish everyone have  the courage and mentality to lose the desire to stop smoking which makes this whole process a lot easier. After all we are already non smokers aint we ?cz at this exact moment no body has that filthy stick in our mouths. 
So lets be happy in the moment right now and nothing else matters!

The way he gets mad when I smoke makes me feel like a worthless loser. I know he hates smoking..I wish I would stop getting myself into this trap. I hate how I feel this week. Its terrible.

Today I had my last cigarette when my vape finally died and I couldn’t find my bottle of juice, I figured it was time. I bought a vape to quit cigarettes and made a slow climb down from 5% to 1.2% but today it wasn’t working so I smoked one last cigarette and I realized I hate these things. Why do I do this to myself? I get sick whenever I smoke any high levels of nicotine but I always crawl back like an abusive relationship. A lot of negative thoughts swarm my mind when I think about how weak I am in the face of addiction. Granted, there have been a lot of unfortunate circumstances I find myself in, but quitting these addictions would be a good step in the right direction right? Then why is it so hard to do the one thing I know will be good for me?

I had really strong cravings for at least 2 months, whereas most online sources will tell you that you are completely free after 3-6 weeks, which constantly made me wonder what was wrong with me and if I can even succeed. My friend who quit at the same time as me also pretty much forgot about the addiction after maybe 3 months. I haven't. It is not too bad most of the time, but I still feel like I'm lacking something.

1557,"After smoking for more than 27 years I had my last cigarette 10 years ago tonight. I took a pull off of what could easily have been my 30th cigarette of the day, and somehow I saw how disgusting smoking really is. The smell, my fingers, my breathing, that cough, that grimy feeling. I threw my smoke to the ground where it belonged and said ""fuck this, fuck this shit, fuck off"" and turned my back on it. I made that decision and I stuck to that decision. Not a puff since. 

The difference between this and every other time I tried to quit was a deep seeded feeling of determinatiin, that I was going to be  bigger than the addiction. I was going to be in control of myself and my actions. I didnt tell anyone either, not even my wife. She noticed at some point, but I think I went 3 months before telling anyone else. No added pressure that way.

For any numbers oriented folks, 30 cigarettes a day over 10 years is 109,500 cigarettes not smoked. Thats a fucking lot of cigarettes. Maybe 10+ pulls on each, that a million pulls...

I used to get up at night to pee and I would light a smoke, so if I can do it and keep doing it, it is in all of us, you just have to really want it, enough to put yourself in charge, not the smoke. Good luck to everyone struggling, I know I tried to quit many times.

1559,"A couple of things to know about me.

1) I’m clean and sober
2) Cigarettes, coffee, and chocolate were my vices.

I didn’t plan on quitting 72 hours ago.  No way.  But because of my insanely wild party past, I’ve had - to put it mildly - a lot of oral health issues.  Over the last few years I did everything you could do to beautify a mouth (and still smoke) except the one thing I needed to truly make my mouth whole again.  Bone grafts.  

The other day a front crown broke and I went to see my dentist.   I figured it would be an easy fix and I’d have my smile back.  Nope. They did some  x-rays and I needed those grafts now if I was ever to have a non-denture smile again.  So I had a choice.  Quit smoking on the spot or put it off and run the risk of losing all my teeth.

In a split second, I chose to quit smoking.  I ran outside to my car and inhaled my final two cigarettes.  My partner was with me so we threw anything related to smoking in a bag, brought it in to the office, and trashed it.   

I got the bone grafts and here I am almost on hour 72 and, yes, it’s really really hard.  I can’t do much in the way of movement or exercise because of the grafts.  I also can’t eat anything beyond smoothies/blended foods and my face is swollen beyond belief.   The past 12 hours or so have been brutal.

Have some work to do?  You should smoke.  Light breeze blowing through the house?  You should smoke. 

Outside of round the world flights I’ve taken, I haven’t gone this long without a cigarette since I started as a kid.  I’ve chosen to go cold turkey on this because my home is littered with patches and pills and lozenges and vapes all bought with good intentions and all barely ever used.

I've been mening to quit for a while and finally developed a tactic by which to succeed. I originally wanted to reduce the smoking, be it day by day, or week by week and have loosely been doing that, but it didn't work in the long term. I have also been using a product known as snus, a nicotine pouch placed between the gums and inner lip, that wasn't to reduce my habit of smoking though, I just wanted more of a kick out of nicotine, as I didn't really catch a buzz off cigarettes alone anymore. 

I now only use snus and don't smoke. This is day 1 for me. I still get to feel some nicotine and perpetuate the ritualistic habit the drug entails for me. This is my solution. 

It does however keep me hooked on nicotine. I don't crave snus as much as cigarettes though, so it'll be an easier transition to stopping my use of nicotine altogether. People used to tell me how tough it was to quit. I believe them now. It's tough, but possible. All you need is something to make the transition easier. Be it the occasional smoke or a substitute.

First, let's state the obstacles :

1. Nicotine is addictive

2. My girlfriend smokes too and would like to stop too, but she is not ready to stop. Whenever I see her smoking, I get a strong craving.

3. My life is very stressful with all the things I have to take care of : my family, my studies, my mental health. 

I have managed to reduce a lot in the last few weeks. I don't buy packs anymore, but cigarettes are always available if I ask my girlfriend. She says she wants to be supportive and help me stop, but I can't really count on her with this. I have to do this mostly on my own. 

If you have read this far, I guess I would need advice about quitting when I live with someone who smokes.

1593,"I made it guys!! A complete year today. Overall, god damn do I feel better than I did when I was smoking.

I was not a heavy smoker. I started with cigarettes (maybe a pack a week), and then I started vaping. Oh lord did that got me addicted to nicotine. I was smoking 30mg at the beginning which is enormous. At the end, I was at 3mg. Then one day I told myself: after this bottle, i’m over. I did smoke 2-3 cigarettes in the first week of trying to stop, but after that, it was OVER.

First month was very hard. Me and my bf both stopped at the same time. We were literally screaming at each other permanently for absolutely no reason lol. But then, I started to feel less tired and weird when I woke up in the morning. I felt overall less stressed troughout the day (I still do sometimes due to an anxiety disorder) but it has been easier dealing with it.

Now, I hardly even think of smoking anymore. Sometimes i’ll see coworkers or friends do it and for a split second I miss it, but the thought of it passes as quick as it arrived. I never get urges to smoke. It’s always just a brief thought of it, and to be able to say no to it without feeling angry is so rewarding and feels so powerful.

What helped me get through it I would say is just the thought of having a better health, more money in my pockets, and tbh, a big ego lol. Also, i’m still super young (22f) so stopping now was the best thing to do for my future self.

In retrospection, this year has had its ups and downs, but hey, I havent smoked!!!! today i am also celebrating 7 days without alcohol!! If you really want to stop, I believe in you. You are stronger than this nicotine bitch. I hope you all a very good day :).

I’m curious to know this because I quit a little over 4 months ago cold turkey after smoking for 12 years (since 16), it was my first quit ever but the difference between me and some of you is that I didn’t want to quit.

I did it because of a health scare that turned out to be nothing and decided that I might as well just continue quit but i’m 4 months in and having a hard time still, perhaps because I didn’t have a goodbye or the urge to quit didn’t come from me but external circumstances… 

Anyway, this is my question to all people who’ve relapsed, did you feel like yourself again after you relapsed? Did it kill your depression/anxiety? I’ve noticed that people who relapse often stop coming to this sub, it must mean that they went on with their livrs as smokers forgettinf about the mental state of withdrawal misery.

1642,"Hello there,

i quitted smocking almoust a year ago, i never had any heavy symtoms but recently i started to become nightmares about smoking again.  To be fair the dreams i have are nothing scary but rather realisticly, so i may started smoking again.

The way i approached my exit strategy was simple, i switched to vaping and tried to figure out why i would smoke in the first place. Since i read that this is how you would approach any other addiction.

When i figured out why i smoked i could easilly quit but now even though i sucsessfully quitted for a year now without any feel of quit im right in this weird situtation and i wonder if people did experience the same.

To be fair i changed alot along quitting, like doing more sports and only for that i would never go back to smoking. But it is weird that my brain seems to still be busy with that.",stopsmoking,hello quitted smocking almoust year ago never heavy symtoms recently started become nightmare smoking fair dream nothing scary rather realisticly may started smoking way approached exit strategy simple switched vaping tried figure would smoke first place since read would approach addiction figured smoked could easilly quit even though sucsessfully quitted year without feel quit im right weird situtation wonder people experience fair changed alot along quitting like sport would never go back smoking weird brain seems still busy
1643,"I’m still a tad bit in the surreal zone and needed somewhere to air my thoughts. I’m on day 6 (tomorrow is one week) and I’m proud of myself (probs the most ever). I’ve been mostly caffeine free for the years (sweet tea only), I am off and on with weed, I drink a maximum of one soda a day, and now no cigarettes. Super surreal that this day has come.

Here’s the story.. I started in middle school off and on and that continued increasing until hs. Senior year, I quit. Come time to go to bars and clubs, I was back to socially smoking. That eventually spilled over into every day life. Over the years, I’d set dates to quit. Like the back of the shampoo bottle, rinse and repeat. Tons of failures over the years (light failures because was my mind really there/ready to quit?). Then I set a hard date where I had to quit, that passed by which was last year. Then September hit and my brain realized I had just swept it under the rug like nothing and so at that point I made a promise to myself to quit by October 1st, but this time had to be different because I was just not going to buy another pack. Pack after pack the cravings pushed me to give in, but my rule was when you finish a pack you have to wait as long as you can before giving in. The longest I made it was 16 hrs without buying a pack. Last Friday hit, my last cig in the pack was around mid day and I started getting that feeling so I pushed it to the end of the day cig before bed.

The biggest part of it, in my opinion, is being ready. Nobody else can do that for you. For me, I asked myself if I want to smoke a year from now and it’d always be an answer of no, but I never pushed myself to do something about it. The second biggest thing is to talk to someone (in my case it is a friend) who has quit so there’s the relatable portion of knowing what its like.

As of right now, I still take my “smoke breaks” just to get away and let it all go, I still have cravings, I still love cigs, but they’re not for me. I put them into the same place as some of the harder things I used to do,,, they’re not for me.

Things are going well! In the last week I've only thought about smoking a handful of times, and none of them were particularly long or strong cravings. We had a friend over last Saturday who still smokes and it felt odd not to be joining him, but I wasn't feeling particularly tempted to. I sat out with him once just for the company, but the smell really put me off.

My anxiety and agitation are down. I'm having an easier time focusing. Things in general are looking up.

Hubby smoked half a cig a couple days ago at work after 11 days without. He said it made him feel like trash afterwards, headachy and nauseated. We talked about how the addiction lied to him. It told him ""your break will feel better with me"" and made him feel sick instead, which increased his stress the rest of the day instead of relieving it. I'm proud of him for keeping going. A stumble doesn't have to be a fall.

Went back to sleep but remembered when I woke up and gave it a go. I often had those thoughts at 3 in the morning… I usually ignored them by the time I got up. I honestly can’t tell you why it was different this time.. sometimes you just build up the will power.

I’m 45.  I’ve  smoked for 30 years… mostly 20 a day but probably 25 the past couple of years. It hasn’t done me any favours with my skin, hair, breathing, fitness, savings.  This is probably my 4th serious quit… I’ve managed 3, 9 and 12 months before.   I hope this is the one.

Im waffling on… the reason I’m posting is to give some reassurance to those a few weeks behind my journey. I found it really difficult for most of the first 5 and a half weeks… some good days to keep me sane but otherwise it just felt relentless. Never ending . Week 3 was particularly hard until I realized it was week 3 and just needed to get through it. Week 5 was a nightmare because I thought week 3 was supposed to be the worst!

But now, all of a sudden, it’s so so much easier.  I can focus on the positives of not smoking rather than constantly mourn the loss. Theres still a couple of times a day when I’d love a smoke, and I think about them often… that probably sounds scary but it’s not that bad at all… it’s not in that all consuming way of the first 5 weeks. It’s such a relief.  It does get better. It does get easier. I’m so pleased with myself when I remember that I forgot to think about smoking.

My husband is a very dedicated smoker so there’s always tobacco in the house… but that’s ok.  The trick is to remember that in x amount of months, when I think I can just have one, I can’t.  I hope this time sticks.

In short… it got so much easier for me after 5 or so weeks… hang in there.",stopsmoking,stopped smoking 50 day ago cold turkey planned woke 3 morning unusual smoker breathing terrible thought sometime maybe could today went back sleep remembered woke gave go often thought 3 morning usually ignored time got honestly tell different time sometimes build power 45 smoked 30 year mostly 20 day probably 25 past couple year done favour skin hair breathing fitness saving probably 4th serious quit managed 3 9 12 month hope one im waffling reason posting give reassurance week behind journey found really difficult first 5 half week good day keep sane otherwise felt relentless never ending week 3 particularly hard realized week 3 needed get week 5 nightmare thought week 3 supposed worst sudden much easier focus positive smoking rather constantly mourn loss there still couple time day love smoke think often probably sound scary bad consuming way first 5 week relief get better get easier pleased remember forgot think smoking husband dedicated smoker always tobacco house ok trick remember x amount month think one hope time stick short got much easier 5 week hang

I've been smoking and vaping for a while now 
Just today my vape ran out (it was an 800 puff disposable with 20mg/ml) and I've only had it since september 30th ish. I'd say I got into a habit of smoking/vaping around 2-3 times per day ish? Basically I would get buzzed before two of my classes, smoke at lunch instead of eating stuff LOL, and smoke for around an hour or less at night. 

Issue is, I've ran out of cash. Each vape costs me 14 bucks and since I already bought a bunch of comic books like a fucking nerd, I have no more money to spend on another vape. I told my friend and she says that I'm going to experience withdrawal really bad since i use it so often. 

How can I deal with withdrawal if I do start to experience it? My friend says it makes you irritable, which is something I obviously don't want. Is there like a home remedy I can try?

I've had almost none physical withdrawal symptoms and a few stronger-than-average cravings that I ofc acknowledged but didn't have to really struggle or anything. All the nicotine should've left my body by now, so it seems the physical addiction should be easing up. 

My question, I guess, is this: can it really be this easy? Or is the worst part still somehow coming..? 😂 How to prepare myself for the future? I would've expected the 1st week to be the worst both mentally and physically, and then gradually easing up. My quit has been so easy from the start that it feels surreal to be going back to smoking.

And yet, the majority of posts that I'm reading here or on FB groups are by people who have quit numerous times. This is also backed up by the statistics. In these posts people have stayed quit for 6 months, a year, or 3 years... before picking up smoking again. And then quitting again.

No longer ‘panic’ if I’ve run out of cigs nor stress if I’m running low (cos I don’t smoke). That really is incredible freedom and eventually becomes a norm without considering the previous burden. 

I no longer need to leave situations to get a fix and so I don’t interrupt our family activities which feels  wonderful. I still catch myself thinking I would have left and missed this or that. 

I don’t stink of smoke. With kids and a partner who doesn’t smoke this is a huge deal for us. 

Don’t really have any strong cravings or maybe even cravings, just perhaps fond memories at times which are followed by ‘it’s never gonna happen’ and ‘remember the shit that comes with that’

money saved but money spent :)

It wasn’t easy but after the initial weeks it settles down and becomes normalised so I hope this gives people hope who are nearer this stage than 3-5 years. [although the 3-5 year people give me hope :) ]

1732,"Hi,

My boyfriend is very secretive about his smoking history because I had cancer before and he never smoked when I met him so when I asked he would just tell me it didn't matter. I know he was being honest about not smoking anymore because he's never lied to me in our relationship. I've asked him things from 6 months ago and he'll give the exact same, truthful answer. My point is that he was genuinely quit. He quit when he started dating his ex girlfriend and then smoked again for a while before quitting and then meeting me. 

This Thanksgiving we were going to his family's dinner and I was very stressed out and anxious, so I smoked a cigarette from a pack that I've had for over a year, that is more full than empty. He went outside with me and looked like a sad puppy dog, and asked me if he could have one puff off of it. I told him no initially but he promised that he just wanted to see if he even like it anymore. Well what do you know an addict trying an addictive substance would get him addicted again. Later when we got back to his home I wanted to smoke my medical Marijuana so he came out with me again and asked if he could have a cigarette. After I went home yesterday he went out and bought a pack. I'm so upset with myself, not with him. I gave him the puff and should have known better.

Does anyone know where I can go from here? I've never seen him be so happy and in such a good mood. I'm afraid now that he knows I won't be upset with him he will never stop. He doesn't seem like he ever wanted to quit in the past and only did it to convenience others. I'm not going to break up over it, this is my mess to clean up.

1740,"Hi everyone!

I was recently talking to someone about quitting smoking and decided to pop back on here to check my number to see how long it has actually been since I quit.  It's been over 4 years!

To anyone quitting now, I am proof that it is possible for anyone!

I quit at age 34 after trying to quit unsuccessfully for about a decade.  Remember that every time you try to quit, whether you succeed or not that attempt, you are closer to quitting.  I do believe that. 

I first quit at age 32 by reading Allen Carr's book ""Easy Way to Quit Smoking"".  

I had heard that if you read this book, you would quit immediately and not suffer through withdrawal.  It sounded like utter bullshit to me!  But, you were allowed smoke while reading it, so I figured I'd try it to prove what bullshit it was. 

I read the book.  It wasn't magic or anything.  It just goes bit by bit and convinces you that you don't need to smoke, and that you are just a drug addict stuck in the ""nicotine trap"".  I smoked the whole time I read it.  I finished it and went to bed.  I woke up the next day and didn't want to smoke. 

I quit for about 8 months.  Then I went to a party where everyone was smoking.  It had been so long and smoking looked so fun, I figured one cigarette wouldn't kill me.  Well, down the slippery slope I went.  Next time with friends, I bummed more cigarettes.  Soon, I was buying packs just for when I was going to be drinking.  Pretty soon after that, I was smoking again. 

Carr's book said that once you quit, all it will take is 1 cigarette to get you going again, and he was absolutely right!  I smoked for another year or so, absolutely furious with myself.  Finally, I decided that enough was enough and I was going to try to quit again.  I remembered everything I had read in the book, and was able to quit cold turkey and never smoke again!

I haven't had a cigarette in over 4 years, and I haven't missed it at all!  I am so thankful and happy that I do not have to smoke anymore.  I will be at parties and events now and try to mindfully think about how much I would have missed before because I was constantly running outside to smoke.  I take deep breaths and enjoy my clear lungs.  I look at the price of cigarettes at convenience stores and smile that I'm not shelling out thousands of dollars on it anymore.  

Not sure if this wall of text will be helpful to anyone, but I hope so.  If anyone is thinking of quitting, I'd recommend the book.  If anyone has already started, keep it up!  You really can do it!",stopsmoking,hi everyone recently talking someone quitting smoking decided pop back check number see long actually since quit 4 year anyone quitting proof possible anyone quit age 34 trying quit unsuccessfully decade remember every time try quit whether succeed attempt closer quitting believe first quit age 32 reading allen carrs book easy way quit smoking heard read book would quit immediately suffer withdrawal sounded like utter bullshit allowed smoke reading figured id try prove bullshit read book wasnt magic anything go bit bit convinces dont need smoke drug addict stuck nicotine trap smoked whole time read finished went bed woke next day didnt want smoke quit 8 month went party everyone smoking long smoking looked fun figured one cigarette wouldnt kill well slippery slope went next time friend bummed cigarette soon buying pack going drinking pretty soon smoking carrs book said quit take 1 cigarette get going absolutely right smoked another year absolutely furious finally decided enough enough going try quit remembered everything read book able quit cold turkey never smoke havent cigarette 4 year havent missed thankful happy smoke anymore party event try mindfully think much would missed constantly running outside smoke take deep breath enjoy clear lung look price cigarette convenience store smile im shelling thousand dollar anymore sure wall text helpful anyone hope anyone thinking quitting id recommend book anyone already started keep really

1743,"I'm pretty upset with her.  She smokes almost a pack every day.  She will spend 30 minutes smoking two or three at a time.   I quit about a year ago and have not touched one since.   Actually, I successfully quit 4 times, each for at least a few months.   I guess that doesn't really mean I was successful.   But living with a chain smoker is not easy.  She keeps promising to quit but doesn't even try.  She ""cuts back"" to quit but that only lasts a day or two

She just got back from a trip with her family.  They do not smoke and they do not know she does.  She keeps it a secret from them.  The trip lasted 10 days.  She promised that she would be done for good.  The very first thing she did as soon as she got back was buy a pack.  And honestly, I knew that's exactly what she was going to do

Apparently her aunt was a little mean to her on the trip.  So according to my wife her aunt is to blame.  And now once again she says the stress from work and dealing with Crohn's disease keep keep her smoking.  She also blames me because she says I can stress her out  

Honestly, this might be a deal breaker for me.  We cannot afford her addiction.  I tell her this often.  But it doesn't change a thing. I'm worried about her long term health which could very well bankrupt us when she needs to be hospitalized or develops severe illnesses.  

I don't want her to resent me.  I don't want to upset her.  I don't want to give her an ultimatum.  Those will only make her habit worse

I asked her to seek help from doctors, counselor, or anything  that will help her quit.  Nope.  Not going to happen 

I don't know what to do.  At this point I don't believe she will ever quit.  Most of her friends smoke and she hangs out with them a few times every week

1751,"Hi, 

I have been lurking this sub for a while now. Been a constant, chronic smoker for two years and wanted to quit as of recently. I told myself I would try self-control and go cold turkey but it hadn’t lasted for more than a few hours. I also do not want to do NRT because I really want the drug out of my system. I downloaded QuitSure and am starting day 3 tomorrow, but haven’t reduced my smoking since the app had suggested not to. 

I guess I am aware of what I need to do for myself but I find that it’s completely different from actually doing it. I feel more anxious/sad now that I see the habit for what it is — a drug addiction — and there’ll be a lot of times where I’ll start to believe those hopeless thoughts and feelings.

I wanted to go cold Turkey but I knew it was going to be rough so I bought the step 3 nicoderm patch with the lowest dose of 7mg and figured this will help with the symptoms. It was definitely a lower dose than what my body was used to because I am still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms.

Day 1 - the urge to smoke was really strong, I really wanted a cigarette in the evening but I stuck my patch on and got through it. Definitely felt some restlessness at night.

Day 2 - today I began to feel slight flu-like symptoms like head pressure and body aches, twisting stomach sensation. But the urge to smoke wasn’t as bad.

I've quit nicotine quite a few times on my journey, 2 years has been my best attempt (so far). I've learned from my attempts that it's easier when I avoid other triggers, addictions, habits to gain ""willpower"". I spent the last month quitting weed and caffeine, and the past few weeks I've been going hard with yoga, exercise, breath-work and meditation to ""feel like a new person and disturb my habitual ruts"". 

I know I can do this without fasting, but I'm wondering if that has helped anyone? I could see it adding a bunch of extra stress on top of withdraws, but maybe it would be more beneficial in ways like speeding up withdraw recovery? I couldn't find any scientific literature on the subject (with nicotine anyways) but personally, once I water fast for 3/4 days I begin to feel amazing.

1774,"I cracked and bought a pack of tobacco. I had managed a biblical total of 40 days cigarette free. On the plus side that was the longest I've ever managed and I'm determined I'm not going to revert back to my former identity as a smoker now. 

Severe loneliness and burnout and low mood definitely contributed to cracking. I'm isolated and my ADHD and depression has been kicking my arse lately along with coping with other life stressors...but I think the main cause of caving was the fact that occasional vaping as part of nicotine reduction had crept up as a smoking substitute and I realised that the last few days I was actually consuming way more nicotine than as a smoker but without the unpleasant side effects of smoking and was therefore just swapping an identity as a smoker for one as a vaper when I had started out so strong with NRT. I know a lot of folks here equate vaping with smoking but personally the main thing I needed to mentally overcome was the habit of smoking and the ability to deceive myself that I need to be a smoker. But more importantly to learn to value myself as worth more than poisoning myself with these horrid things.

Damages to your lungs, loss of vocal box, throat cancer and many others smoking related diseases. I have also tried quitting MANY TIMES, going cold turkey before picking up another cig mere hours later. It was a brutal, endless cycle that seems to not helping. Best is 99 days 4 years ago and it was ruined by just ONE puff, which i thought was harmless. I also vape heavily. Low nicotine juice dont work for me, 50mg juices are my favourite and although i try using it as alternatives to cigaratte, it was not helping either. I will vape in the car and the moment i stepped outside, i will smoke 2 cigaratte. I felt vaping made my smoking habit worst. Also i believe, cold turkey doesnt work for me. And i stop giving up smoking. Life is short and everyone will die anyway so who cares? 


Eventually sometime in July last year, i decided to quit again. Not immediately but to do it on the day after my birthday, which was 3 months later back then. Since, i enjoy smoking more. Every cigarette i smoke, i enjoyed it. I appreciated every drag. As the date came closer for me to ‘quit’, i realised smoking is not at all fun. It was a waste of time and money. I wouldnt believe it when i was a smoker but smoking WASTE YOUR TIME. Alot of time! I started to feel excited to quit. 

And on my birthday last year, the day i supposed to quit, i bought 3 packs of cigs. These are my last, so i bought menthol, normal and clove cigarattes. I sat in one bench and smoke away, reminiscing the time about the day i first started to smoke. I smoke 2,3,4 cigarette at a time. Every cig make me sick and i dont actually feel anything. It was not really enjoyable as i have thought. 

Night time comes and i know i should not smoke the next morning. Threw all my cig away except one stick (for emergency) I went to bed and slept the night. Next morning, i had a few urges and threw the last stick away and reminded myself that i am now a non smoker and keep doing that and get myself the mindset that smokers are a disgust and bunch of losers because they cant quit but i can do it and lo and behold, it has been one year now and i have zero craving for cigarette!

&amp;#x200B;

Dear quitters of Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who quit smoking four years ago today, I want to share my insight and personal experience on what worked for me. I am in no way a professional or a counselor or qualified to give advice, I am just a person who has smoked for twelve years and decided on a Tuesday afternoon in October of 2017 that it was enough. I haven't relapsed once and these days I don't even think about it anymore. Except of course today, because a reminder popped up an told me ""Four years smoke free today"".

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of quitting had been in my mind for a while. Not because my partner wanted me to quit, or because I thought cigarettes were getting too expensive. Not even because I worried that I could develop some nasty health issues when I got older.

&amp;#x200B;

I quit because I wanted to be free of my addiction. And, more specifically: I wanted to be able to sit through an entire movie on Netflix without having to pause for a smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Before**

I would always worry if I had enough cigarettes with me. If the shops were still open. If I could smoke at place X. I used to think in smoke breaks, as I'm sure many of you can relate to. Five minutes before a meeting? Time for a cigarette. Commercials on tv? Smoke time. A short walk to a bus stop? Smoke time. I didn't want to admit it, but smoking cigarettes dominated my entire schedule. It did so sneakily, but it did so nonetheless. If I spent two hours or more in a museum, I wanted to get outside and smoke. I didn't necessarily want to leave, but my addiction was demanding my attention. I couldn't concentrate on the beautiful art before me, I was only thinking ""when can I smoke?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**During withdrawal**

Did you know that people who quit smoking are often fighting more than one fight? Of course you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You fight the withdrawal symptoms.

2. You fight the desire to smoke. 

3. For some, fighting against overeating as a substitute.

4. You struggle as your brain re-adjusts itself to a life without cigarettes (the habitual part, the part where you don't know what to do with your hands).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a big difference between wanting to quit and being told to quit (either by a person or a situation): I wanted to quit, so I didn't have to fight the desire to smoke. I knew for a fact that I never wanted to light up a cigarette ever again. A switch had flipped in my brain as clearly as if a light turned on in a room.

Now, that did not make the withdrawal symptoms any less bad. The nicotine receptors in my brain were as loud as they always were. The thing that made it easier is that I was able to look beyond the initial withdrawal and focus on the ""after"". Withdrawal doesn't last forever. it's a very real, chemical process in your brain. The nicotine receptors shrink after a while and you won't crave cigarettes anymore. After that, there is a calmer, clearer mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of thinking ""I can't smoke anymore"", I thought ""I've quit smoking. I am experiencing these withdrawal symptoms. I feel like sh\*t but I know this won't last forever. After this is over, I will be free.""

&amp;#x200B;

I would write it down whenever I was wide awake at 3AM, restless, irritated, antsy, grinding my teeth and unable to stay still. In fact, I wrote a lot in the deep dark hours of the night, mostly just describing my feelings or record the time as it passed by. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**After**

First and foremost: I am not a saint. Quitting smoking didn't miraculously heal all my problems and there are many things I struggle with (I got 99 problems but a smoke ain't one). I am not the person who is going to tell you that you will feel amazing and fantastic and reborn. No - you will feel... normal. I feel normal. And it's the best kind of normal I can imagine, because smoking made me feel like a pariah. I can exit any building I have been in for however many minutes and not reach for my cigarettes the moment I walk out. I can make my coffee in the morning and snuggle up on the couch while looking at the downpour and not stand in it, shivering, with coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I don't count in cigarettes anymore. A meeting is now not in one cigarette, but in five minutes. I am no longer constantly thinking about it, being inconvenienced by it, distracted by it, controlled by it. I can spend hours in a museum and be amazed and fully focused on the beauty I see. I can go to the cinema and stay in my seat during the break. I feel normal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion**

I encourage everyone to go and feel super normal. I know everyone's situation is different and I am not here to tell you one method is wrong and the other is right. I just want to shine some light on your motivation to quit smoking. Because if the motivation comes from within you, if you are the one who decides, you can do it. The fight won't be as difficult. And it will 100% be worth it to just not have to think about those stupid cigarettes anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I chose a time in my life where I felt I wasn't under high stress and things were going relatively well. No exams, no lousy job, I had just moved out on my own, so I had the mental capacity to deal with the emotions.

It is unhelathy, it is expensive, it makes you stink. Why would anyone want to smoke, at all?

2. It is stressful

When you're a smoker, you always have to worry about having a lighter, lighting up, cigarette butts, ash, emptying ashtrays, buying a pack, having a pack, opening windows during winter when your room stinks, and it's all really - a lot. Once you quit it's all gone.

3. No smoking lifestyle - is a healthy lifestyle

Once you quit smoking, you start to take care of  your body as well. You develop a healthy mindset. For example, I started to take a lot more vitamins than I used to, and drink a lot more teas. You simply choose what's good for you.

4. It's an achievement

If you're a smoker who quit smoking, you feel proud of yourself. Like, I really did that? I managed to quit an addiction? And you just feel better about yourself. It's an huge ego boost, and you start to see yourself as someone who is capable of anything.

5. You're calmer

1798,"Hey everyone,

I'm going to give an account of my journey from smoking, to changing over to vaping, to quitting fully now, just to say thanks for helping me quit smoking more than anything else ever did, and probably saving my life in the process. Hopefully this can give inspiration to others that want to quit and will give ideas on the methods I used that may work for someone else.

I'll start when I was 18, in 2009/2010 and started smoking. My first pack was Marlboro menthol 100s. the funny feeling of getting dizzy from smoking and thinking it was kind of cool continued for a bit until I was fully addicted and couldn't stop, nor did I really want to. I remember thinking after a few years that I wish I had never started, as the person that got me into smoking had quit, most of my friends that smoked had quit or at least only smoked when partying, etc. and here I was smoking all time and couldn't stop. Well at least I never bought cartons right? That was the point that would mean I was smoking too much, at least that's what I rationalized in my head.

For years this went on, switching from Marlboro Menthols, to Camel Filters, to Camel Crush, to Camel Crush Bold, then when they were banned I went to Camel Menthols. At this point it had been 7 years since I started smoking. I had quit about 4 or 5 years into smoking for about 4 months but I said to myself one day that i could just have a couple when drinking, which progressed right back to full on smoking habit. I was kicking myself because it was so miserable to quit cold turkey like i had and now I'd have to go through it again if i was going to quit again, which I thought I might never. I had started buying cartons maybe a year or 2 before the seven year mark, something i never wanted to do. Every paycheck I would buy a carton plus 4 packs, as I was smoking close to a pack a day. I had tried vaping before this point, with the little pen vapes that weren't very good or didn't last very long on battery. I could never figure out how to get the lung hit that I needed and got whenever smoking a cigarette, so I never stuck with the vaping. If i was just going to feel like i was breathing flavored air then what was the point? Like I said this was towards the beginning of when vaping was becoming a thing, I tried to be one of the earliest adopters but it didn't work for me.

At around 7 years I was starting to wake up and not be able to take full breaths until like 5 or 10 minutes after waking up. My lungs were hurting every morning and I knew my smoking days had to come to an end as this was definitely not good. It legitimately scared me feeling like that every couple mornings for about 6 months. That's when a coworker at the time, who i would smoke with on smoke breaks, got big into vaping. I mean, went off the deep end on all the tech, different tanks and atomizers, making his own coils, all that kind of stuff. This was also right at the beginning of box mods becoming popular, so that was a plus for me, since the pen batteries only had maybe a 5 hour battery life for me and wouldn't get me all the way through work. He started showing me a bunch of this stuff and I headed to a vape shop with him to see all the different things i could try after trying his tank and box mod setup, that made a lot more vapor than the pens too.

In the end I ended up picking up a Sigelei 100w box mod [https://imgur.com/a/vAwFKeo](https://imgur.com/a/vAwFKeo) and a Kanger subtank [https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL](https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL) . I was originally using 18 or 12 mg nicotine juice and paid attention while smoking cigs to see what it felt like with air flow, lung hit feel, etc. I found that cutting the airflow almost completely off, to where it felt like i was dragging on a cig, and having the high nicotine content and a dual coil at 60w to give the harsh lung hit, was exactly what I was looking for. I was smoking and vaping for months, still holding onto the cigs, until I noticed one day that I was picking the vape over the cigs more and more often because it tasted better, and specifically remember being at work on a smoke break and smoking a quarter of a cig and throwing it out. I thought at that point ""why are you still smoking these things, you're throwing most of it away, it is a waste of money now."" That is when I went on to vape completely. I believe this was 2016. 

The years go by, still only vaping, still using 12mg as 18 was kind of phased out of use in the whole industry it seemed, and was satisfied. Whenever i had a cig at a party or something every 6 months or so, it would taste terrible, and I'd toss it after only a few puffs. I had the Sigelei 150w temperature control [https://imgur.com/a/Be7b8cq](https://imgur.com/a/Be7b8cq) by then, still the same Kanger tank [https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL](https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL) with the dual coils, not using the temperature function at all, just the same 60w as usual. I remember other vapers commenting they couldn't believe i still had that setup still, like it was an antique or something haha! 

Well around the end 2019 I believe, I could not find coils for the tank anymore and the box mod was pretty beat up too, so I went to the local bigger vape shop and asked about what was good nowadays as I never took it on as a hobby and had no idea what kind of tech was out there now for box mods and tanks. The guy behind the counter was using a Voopoo Drag 2 [https://imgur.com/a/8Qp8xzZ](https://imgur.com/a/8Qp8xzZ) and a Freemax Mesh Pro tank [https://imgur.com/a/xg06AuG](https://imgur.com/a/xg06AuG) . I bought those for my new setup and was happy with it. The mesh helped get an instant hit like if you were hitting a cig, plus setting it up the same way with the airflow almost closed off got that cig feel and i was good to go. I was a little worried i'd lose that feel with a new setup and go back to smoking.

So now we get to the end of 2020. Keep in mind that I had been ordering my coils and juice online for years from giantvapes and hadn't had to deal with the hassle of going to a store for anything other than that new setup. Here comes Trump's dumbass vape mail ban, I couldn't believe it. I bought what I could until I couldn't order anymore and hoped to see how that would hold me, but I knew the end of vaping was coming for me. I wasn't going to pay double the price for stuff in a physical store. That ended up not being the case but i was sure it would be that way, as it used to be 23$ for a 30ml bottle back in the day from a store, and half that online (This shows you how long it had been since i had gone into a physical store lol).

I finished my last bit of 12mg after a couple months and decided to try to start to ween myself off nicotine if i could. This never worked before with cigs and I always had the experience of not getting the lung hit with lesser nicotine juice, but i thought i would try it. So I dropped to 6mg, and i was shocked to find it still had a lung hit. Maybe not as hard but I was used to it after a few days and I was good to go. After I ran out of 6mg a couple months later, I dropped to 3mg for a couple months, with the same effect, got used to the hit after a couple days and it was fine. This whole time I had not craved for more nicotine, nor was I vaping any more than I used to, which was a pleasant surprise, even though I pretty much vaped constantly anyways.

Now we get to about 2 months ago. I was taking the last big step and buying 0mg nicotine juice after not being without nicotine for about 12 years. I guess because i had stepped down to 3mg and was still able to vape to satisfy the habit/mental part of it, i had nearly NO WITHDRAWALS! It was amazing, the only affect i had was a little irritation and foggy headedness the first day but after that it was like nothing happened, I didn't crave it because I was still vaping, so it was nothing like when i quit cold turkey. The only issue was that now, with 0mg nicotine, it really did feel like there was no lung hit anymore, like i was just breathing flavored air again, and I worried about going back to the nicotine juice again and getting dependent on nicotine again. I just puffed harder to get what little lung hit 0mg has and I kicked the nicotine.

Now we're to about a week ago, and not getting the lung hit is starting to annoy me. I had the realization that I'm not enjoying this anymore as I'm expecting to get that lung hit and getting disappointed every time I vape, once again the ""flavored air, what's the point"" thing. So I said screw it and dropped it all together. I have taken a couple puffs since a week ago but that is it, I've pretty much quit altogether. 

I never thought I would quit vaping, as it is safe and I enjoy the act of smoking so why would I quit? Well the mail ban and not wanting to be addicted to something anymore has finally made it a pain in the ass enough where i'm done with it. No more sneaking puffs indoors somewhere because it's not allowed there. No more going outside in the rain or freezing cold or sweltering heat at work to get puffs because i NEED it. No more making a nasty film on the inside of the glass in my car because the vape condenses on them and it's a bitch to clean off. No more dreading flying on a plane because from the time you get into the airport until the time you're out of your destination airport, there's basically nowhere to vape/smoke and I vaped/smoked like a chimney. And no more coughing in the morning, even though vaping is safe it would still condense on the inside of my lungs and make me cough some in the morning and throughout the day.

My entire adult life I've needed nicotine to make it by, always having to plan ahead to make sure I had enough cigs or juice to make it through to when i could buy more, or being broke in my early adult years and spending money on cigs rather than food because I couldn't be without it. I keep looking over to grab my vape and walk outside out of habit, then I remember I dont need that anymore, it's not even with me. I have literally stood up at work, and paced around the office, thinking it felt weird that I hadn't gone outside for a vape yet. It's like it's all totally new for me, I haven't not done these things since I was in high school, and it feels great!

Anyways, the point to all this is just to share with people that understand what I went through, as most of us have to some degree had a similar story I think and to share a story that may help more of you make that transition from smoking to vaping, using the way i set up the vape to make it feel like a cigarette, or from vaping to fully quitting if you choose. I was on 12mg nicotine for god's sake, most vapers couldn't even hit my vape because it would give them coughing fits from how strong it was. If I can do it you definitely can, cliche I know, but try it out the way I did and it may work for you. Those of you that are continuing to vape, no shade thrown towards you either. If it wasn't banned from getting supplies mailed to me, I'd probably still be vaping, and I definitely loved having a way to ""smoke"" without risking cancer, stinking of cig smoke, etc. I'm thankful that vaping got me off cigs which I don't think I could've done myself, and it pisses me off to no end that it is demonized when it has saved so many lives, myself included. It didn't matter that I saw my great uncle without a nose because he had to have it removed because of smoking. It didn't matter seeing those commercials with the guy with the hole in his throat, or any of that stuff. Vaping was finally the thing that worked, and after all these years I can say I'm free, to join the people I started smoking with all those years ago that quit as well. 

Thanks for all the help over the years on this subreddit and encouragement, I wish you all the best, and with any luck, this will by my last goodbye to this sub. Be excellent to each other!

PS: Don't look at my number of days that I have been quit on this sub, that was set when I quit cold turkey the first time, you can see how long ago that was.

We have supposedly already seen every single video possible yet I find one labeled name and name. So I think cool that'll be funny and pop it on.

I was sat at the kitchen dining table holding a role up in each hand and smoking both.

It was at this point I realised as an adult (28) that I was disgusted with myself, I was a child back then and I should of had better parental care but I know my mum had just came out of a really bad domestic violence relationship so I kinda don't blame her for being so withdrawn, I mean I don't know personally what that is like to be beat up for years.

I have two kids and I've stopped smoking various times, of course whilst pregnant, months after having my kids I'd pick the habit up whilst stressed, then I quit again and the cycle would continue.

I watched that video as a parent and thought to myself I'd that was my kid this would NOT be happening!

So it's now 4.08am when I wake up a little later I'm banging a patch on and going for it, that home video has been the ultimate wake up call for me because of the different levels of disgust I feel.

I blamed it on some medication I was taking, and since doctors are supposed to report side-effects of prescribed medications, I even insisted that he report it to the manufacturer.

About a week ago, there has been much less hair in the drain.  This morning, I noticed practically none.  I was perplexed.  I'm still taking the medication.  Why the sudden turnaround?  What am I doing differently?

And then it occurred to me, the only thing I'm doing differently, is NOT SMOKING.

1835,"Hi everybody, 

I hope you're all doing well. Today marks the 6th day without smoking cigarettes for me. This is the longest I've been in over 1 year and 10 months! I'm 22y old and university student.

This is going to be a long post and I'm sorry in advance.

I'd been a smoker for 2 years but with a ''vacation off cigarettes'' for couple of months where I would smoke one or two here and there but that was it. Throughout my smoking ''career'' I was increasing how much I smoke during the day throughout those 2 years. In the end I would smoke 1 pack and sometimes even 1 and a half or maybe 2 when I was stressed. I realize that 2 years may seem like nothing but believe me, I was a smoker like anyone else with a longer cigarette smoking history behind. My day was built around cancer sticks, they were the first thing for me in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. I would go freezing myself on the balcony in the winter to smoke and I would go in the middle of the night to buy a pack on the machine because tobacco shops didn't work at 12am. This was all just a sign that I was ADDICTED TO A DRUG. Being addicted isn't fun at all. Problem is that some smokers don't even want to accept the fact that they are addicted, they think they like smoking, but that's just a trick their brain is playing on them.

I quit with the help of 25mg Nicorette patch.Without it I would have never quit. I just don't have that strong of a willpower to quit without NRT. I've tired gum and lozenges but I threw up because of the taste and how much I just didn't like them so I decided to get the patches.

The biggest thing I noticed is how much more free time I have now. I can finally dedicate myself to playing video games that I really love and not playing for 1 hour and then craving for a cigarette. I can drink coffee and actually spend time with it, talking to persons around me and not craving for anything. I'll buy a book to read in my free time as well and I'll study more to finish the last couple of exams I have left to graduate.

My biggest motivators to quit were my financial situation, I truly believe that every person should be a better human being to himself/herself and to his family and people who he or she loves. I didn't want my mom and gran to spend money to buy me cigarettes and not have enough for other things... I also wanted to do things I love like gaming and reading and watching things without constantly being bothered for a smoke. I also didn't want to be anxious when I don't have enough cigarettes for the day. And many other things.

I plan to gradually reduce the strenght of the patches within the next few weeks and finally get off them as well. I always take them off before going to sleep and I don't have any issues. During the first few days with the patches I noticed that my skin where the patch is would itch but that would pass within few minutes so not that big of a deal.

I encourage all to quit, using any method you may need or you may find suitable. My psychatrist told me not to quit cold turkey so I didn't and I couldn't have done it that way.

1838,"I’ve been a smoker for 20 years and some, 15 to 20 cigarettes a day. I’ve tried quitting 10+ times : cold turkey, vaping, patches and nicotine candies. The longest I went without smoking were 4 and 7 months, using a vape.

I’m currently 8 months pregnant, down to 6 to 10 cigarettes a day and desperate about ever quitting. I’m in a very poor mental state due to the guilt and worry of smoking while pregnant, and perpetual anxiety because of the stigma, even though you’d guess I’m trying to hide it.

I’ve been actively trying to stop since I got pregnant but with no success. I couldn’t get past 24h so far. I’ve seen a midwife that specializes in addiction and got prescribed patches and candies, but they’re the lowest possible dosage and don’t really bring down the urges beside a psychological effect. I hate the candies too and will switch to gums on my next try.

At this point I kind of gave up on the pregnancy motivator since I’ve been smoking for the past full 7 months... but I can’t stomach that I’ll still be smoking when my baby is born. This is disheartening to me. I don’t give up on trying, but I need to plan my next attempt so that I’m not immediately overwhelmed by the cravings.

I can manage to avoid the cigarettes that I usually smoke “throughout the day”, but some are so deeply rooted in my habits and routines that I’ve the hardest time to fight back. The first cigarette of the morning, that I have with  coffee after breakfast, is a big one. Then the one after lunch. Then the one after dinner.

Then I get the worst cravings in the evening, and especially after I’ve put my son to bed and I’m able to lay back and relax. My husband is a heavy smoker too, and this is usually a time when we sit in the garden and chat and smoke. I easily smoke half a day worth of cigarettes there in one sitting, over a couple hours before going to bed. The association between that moment and smoking is so strong I don’t know how to fight it. This is where all previous attempts have failed.

I take any advice to help me change things around and support my efforts.",stopsmoking,smoker 20 year 15 20 cigarette day tried quitting 10 time cold turkey vaping patch nicotine candy longest went without smoking 4 7 month using vape currently 8 month pregnant 6 10 cigarette day desperate ever quitting poor mental state due guilt worry smoking pregnant perpetual anxiety stigma even though guess trying hide actively trying stop since got pregnant success get past 24h far seen midwife specializes addiction got prescribed patch candy lowest possible dosage really bring urge beside psychological effect hate candy switch gum next try point kind gave pregnancy motivator since smoking past full 7 month stomach still smoking baby born disheartening give trying need plan next attempt immediately overwhelmed craving manage avoid cigarette usually smoke throughout day deeply rooted habit routine hardest time fight back first cigarette morning coffee breakfast big one one lunch one dinner get worst craving evening especially put son bed able lay back relax husband heavy smoker usually time sit garden chat smoke easily smoke half day worth cigarette one sitting couple hour going bed association moment smoking strong know fight previous attempt failed take advice help change thing around support effort

This level of, let me say, intimacy provides a chance to talk more openly. We also grabbed a beer. These two occurrences are among my worst smoking triggers. Now, I thought I'd be good to go and resistant to cravings. However, at some point of our conversation I found myself saying ""I'm gonna regret it but fuck it, let's grab a cig"". It was met with a stern no from my friends and a bit of asking why I'd need to smoke. While my urge remained, I avoided smoking. 

What's really surprising is the fact that they were actually supportive. Now, I don't really want any support, someone pitying me or whatever, but it felt unusual in a pleasant way. Definitely unlike things I would expect.

 Today I am 28 days smoke free and still going strong!

First 3 days were pretty tough, I had mild tremors and double vision accompanied by somewhat bearable headaches that would come and go throughout the day. Of course agitation was high on the list with my anxiety also being particularly problematic. This was soon followed by excessive mucus down the nasal passage which I did my best to spit out when I was able to but when I wasn't able to, it contributed to congestion and inflammation in the chest, which ultimately felt similar to a chest cold. For that I bought an over the counter bronchodilator syrup which was a great relief and helped get rid of the congestion pretty quickly. A big bowl of chicken soup also helps heaps.

By the end of my first week, I started bloating quite a bit and experienced gastro symptoms, passing larger and more frequent stools. This lasted for the following two weeks and I did make a point of not falling prey to eating more. To help with the stomach issues I started eating cleaner, more veg and probiotics which seemed to settle the stomach issues and the bloating subsided completely after two weeks. 

The purpose of this post is to help others who are either wanting to quit smoking to understand what they COULD experience or those who have recently quit make sense of their symptoms/side effects. We won't all experience the same symptoms/side effects but I think it is worth a shot to share our post quitting experiences because the internet is not always a great help.

In the last 5-6 years I have made a lot of tough decisions and changes (for the better) and I really am a different person: Very confident relatively successful and clear on what I want in life (after many years of suffering from severe anxiety and low self-esteem). Now, It's time for another important step: Letting go of smoking and start focusing on a brighter and healthier future.

Arround 19 yo I started to feel the negative impact (big trouble with breathing, headaches, insomnia, occasionall heart disrythmia which scares me the most, weird pressure etc) I went from smoking to nicotine pouches and I started to feel much better after couple of days but now it is back for like half a year so I want to quit for good. 

At one point because I am working on a ship. I wasnt able to buy new pouches for cca 14 days. So I was just using the used ones all the time which turned out to have a very good placebo effect. The 14th day I realised that I dont feel any cravings anymore. Unfortunately I didnt plan to quit at that time so I didnt grab that oportunity and bought a new ones and basically started again. Fucking idiot !

But what came to my mind now is that. Because Im addicted to it so hard that when I tried cold turkey it just didnt seem possible. Maybe its a good idea to try this placebo strategy. 

So tomorrow is my first day.

It was with some colleagues and my boss, who let's just say I find challenging even when I'm not in nicotine withdrawal. So halfway through the meeting she said something pretty rude to me, which I'm used to and just try to ignore because she's my boss after all. Well instead, today I replied to her: ""EXCUSE ME?!!!""

My heart was pounding. Everyone's jaw dropped. I was panicking. What did I just do?!! Seconds passed. Then she apologized. Twice. And pulled me aside later to apologize some more.

I lucked out here. I wasn't really in control of that situation and it easily could have gone another way. But I have to say I felt like a million bucks hearing her apologize to me over and over.

1901,"Today is Day 14 for me! (And a very proud Day 7 for my husband!)

Things are getting easier. There have been a couple days this week that I've managed to go 4-6 hours without thinking about a smoke instead of fighting a craving every hour. The cravings are weaker and easier to distract myself from. 

I'm still struggling some with sleep. I've been feeling kind of zombie-ish the last week. Tired and bloated and like I've got a bit of a head cold. My anxiety and agitation are both on the intense side but my mood swings are calming down.

Mostly it just feels good though. Every crappy day has still been better than a day spent smoking. 

I particularly am coming to love:

* Not feeling like I have to smoke before I can go anywhere/do anything. I've mentioned this a few times on here but oh my god it's so annoying how everrryyyythingggggg starts being structured around cigarettes. And it makes anything you need to do feel like a massive chore. Even simple stuff. ""Ugh, gotta go CHECK THE MAILBOX. Guess I'll have a cig first. And one after."" Like what??? Just walk thirty feet and grab the mail it's not a hardship that you need cigarettes to get through 😆

* Not having to shower every time I leave the house to avoid smelling too much like smoke. Now I don't smell like smoke because I don't smoke anymore. That's pretty great.

* Not feeling like a loser every time my bonus kid is over and I miss time with them to step out on the porch and get my fix. Or feeling like a loser when they come outside with me to spend time and have to breathe my secondhand smoke. I don't wanna do that to my kid. 

* Looking healthier in general. My teeth already look so much better??? I don't know how that's possible in 2 weeks but they already look brighter. So do my eyes. My skin is a pimply mess right now but I know that'll go away too in a week or so. 

* Feeling healthier in general. Deep breaths come more easily and I haven't noticed my heart racing/pounding as often. My stamina is already starting to improve a bit and I feel less winded during activities. 

I'm sure there are other positives I haven't mentioned, but these are the big ones for me right now.

That may not seem like a lot to some, but it started feeling like a lot to me, which I wonder if body size has anything to do with. (I'm about 120 lbs and 5'4""). The minimum I've been able to get to per day has been about 4 cigarettes, and the maximum number of days I seem to be able to reach without smoking at all has been 2, over the last few months. During the days I am not smoking, I've basically learned to expect having lots of really, really depressed feelings. I don't seem to have any other withdrawal symptoms that I notice, but it's really tough to go through the constant struggle to not have racing thoughts and depression. 

I'd love to be able to get on meds for the depression, but I cannot afford them. I think they would help a lot, so it's something I may try to prioritize more. I am also in counseling and quitting smoking has been an ongoing topic with my therapist, but honestly, it hasn't helped. I feel that it only makes me feel more guilty, and it loads on more stress because I feel more pressured to quit for someone else. Not for me. 

I think my main problem is that I don't enjoy life in general, so I don't see a way that life would necessarily get better without smoking, only that I wouldn't have to live with the fears and other things that accompany smoking.

1914,"Hey r/stopsmoking,

yesterday I (26) was at the pulmologist with my mother (60) and as expected she got bad news. 
She's smoking since her youth and the effects are getting bigger. I wasn't shocked when the doctor told her she has COPD. 
Her lung is wounded and she can't walk like 50 meters without almost passing out. 
The disappointing part is, that she is not able to stop smoking.
It's a topic we had for years. Part of why I stopped smoking half a year ago after 10 years was to be an example for her.
But she blocks every way I try to help her. 
My next try will be like a Presentation for her. I will show her in detail, but as easy as I can what COPD is and what a difference it would make to stop smoking. She really has her problems to understand the topic and I want to give her the chance to understand it. If she still don't want to stop smoking then, I will atleast have tried my best. I have to tell you, it's not easy to see your own mother slowly dying. That's why I won't ever give up fighting for her life.

I encourage everybody to try to stop smoking. I don't want to mention the bad effects of smoking, but I want you to see the chances of stopping.
I stopped 7 month 4 days and 15 hours ago and I don't regret it. 
It's the first time I had a success in my life where I am proud of every day that I reached it. I am more into sports since I stopped. I soon stopped coughing and now I only cough like ""normal"" people. I don't have the bad smell and I save alot of money.
The biggest point is that I enjoy to breathe now. 

Non-smoking has only benefits. I had some hard moments since I quit but I never needed a cigarette because I knew that it will cause problems than solving them. 
Nobody's perfect and I didn't succeed in my first try, but this time, although I'm an absolute pessimist, I'm safe to say that I'll never smoke again.
By the way. Think about your loved ones. I always hated it when friends said that I should stop smoking. But they just had the need to tell me this because the didn't want me to die early.

I hope this post can help.

1916,"I had a realization tonight. I've listened to the recording of Allen Carr's book *Easy Way to Stop Smoking* at least a dozen times now, and although the idea usually sticks for a while - I've ""cracked"" and smoked each time. And it's always a bummer!

Anyway. I read a comment on here once which said something along the lines of ""I'm a nonsmoker now. I don't smoke. I don't want to smoke. **If a meteor were headed for Earth to kill us all, I still wouldn't smoke.**"" And that last line always stuck with me!

I mean - if *a god damn meteor* were about to *kill us all*.... fuck it, right? Smoke up! 

And despite listening to that damn book over and over to make sure I fully understood every point and counter-argument to the shit my brain would come up with to justify smoking... I still never could get over that meteor thing. Because deep down I still believed it was actually an enjoyable experience to smoke and relieve my nicotine withdrawals. Which basically meant I'd never really gotten the point of that damn book lol.

I don't want to smoke. I don't ever want to smoke again. And I'm pretty I never wanted to smoke in the first place - except for those first few experimental times. What I want is to *not* want to smoke. Does that make sense? And for most of my life, the only way to get rid of that craving/urge to smoke was to just smoke. Yet the sick joke is that smoking is what perpetuates the eternal hell of always wanting to smoke. 

I don't want to smoke. I want to not want to smoke, and I do that by not smoking. Every time I think I want a cigarette - I realize ""no. I don't want a cigarette, I am having a trigger/craving/urge to do what I've always done. But that has not worked, and it will not ever work. I want to be free of this hellish nightmare of suffering feelings of withdrawal followed by feeling guilty for caving in."" And I do that by not smoking. And every day the nicotine leaves my body a bit more, and every day I train myself to react to triggers by not wanting to pursue that damned strategy I fooled myself into relying on.

And to that end - it's a relief to realize that as long as I've got my head screwed on right, I won't ever fall for the trick again. Not tomorrow and not next year, because if I plan on smoking again one day - to throw out all logic and self-preservation for a phantom of relief - then I might as well do it this very moment. Logical fallacies have a way of immediately collapsing the entire framework like that. I get it now. I don't want to smoke. I never want to smoke. Gun to my head, meteor headed right for the Earth, that sucks... but suggesting I smoke a cigarette is just as dumb of an idea as suggesting I shoot up heroin or bash my toe with hammer.",stopsmoking,realization tonight ive listened recording allen carrs book easy way stop smoking least dozen time although idea usually stick ive cracked smoked time always bummer anyway read comment said something along line im nonsmoker dont smoke dont want smoke meteor headed earth kill u still wouldnt smoke last line always stuck mean god damn meteor kill u fuck right smoke despite listening damn book make sure fully understood every point counterargument shit brain would come justify smoking still never could get meteor thing deep still believed actually enjoyable experience smoke relieve nicotine withdrawal basically meant id never really gotten point damn book lol dont want smoke dont ever want smoke im pretty never wanted smoke first place except first experimental time want want smoke make sense life way get rid cravingurge smoke smoke yet sick joke smoking perpetuates eternal hell always wanting smoke dont want smoke want want smoke smoking every time think want cigarette realize dont want cigarette triggercravingurge ive always done worked ever work want free hellish nightmare suffering feeling withdrawal followed feeling guilty caving smoking every day nicotine leaf body bit every day train react trigger wanting pursue damned strategy fooled relying end relief realize long ive got head screwed right wont ever fall trick tomorrow next year plan smoking one day throw logic selfpreservation phantom relief might well moment logical fallacy way immediately collapsing entire framework like get dont want smoke never want smoke gun head meteor headed right earth suck suggesting smoke cigarette dumb idea suggesting shoot heroin bash toe hammer

1920,"I started smoking in college while I was also working a weekend job. My work had a lot of down time so almost everyone in the warehouse would sit around chain smoking. They would smoke in the trucks and at our delivery sites. Eventually it became too tempting and to relieve stress from work and school I began smoking as well.

At first it was just cigarillos. I would smoke one in the morning before class. They used to sell flavored cigarillos which made it easier to get into. Then one day I ran out, so I bummed a smoke from someone on campus. I realized they weren't as bad I thought they would be, and they were cheaper, so I started buying those instead.

Then it turned into a social thing. Hanging out with the other guys between class at the smoke pit and shooting the shit. Smoking in a circle in the warehouse with the other guys at work before our next delivery. Some of my other friends had started smoking as well so I would smoke a lot at parties. One cigarillo in the morning turned into about 8-12 smokes a day.

I still lived at home and had to hide it from my parents. I'm not sure how they couldn't smell it when I came home but I managed to hide it. One time they found an empty pack in my car and called me out on it. I said I had smoked some but had quit already, which was a lie. Then I kept smoking in secret. I knew it was an addiction.

Eventually the guys in my class started switching to vapes. This was in the somewhat early days of vaping around 2015. I picked up a cheap vape and found it was actually pretty easy to switch from cigarettes to the vape. The vape tasted better and at the time juice was pretty cheap. It was easier to hide and I could vape inside (I never smoked inside or in my car).

The cheap vape turned into sub-ohm mods, DIY coil wrapping, and bigger and bigger bottles of juice. It got more and more expensive. I didn't do the math but it might have been more expensive than smoking. Occasionally I would go back to smokes when I ran out of juice, but could switch back to the vape pretty easily.

It came to a point where I knew I couldn't keep vaping. But quitting vaping was incredibly hard. I tried and failed a dozen times. Vaping was too easy and too convenient and I couldn't resist it.

I made a promise 2 years ago that I would stop vaping. I failed, but kept it a secret. I hid it from the person I promised it to. The second time I lied and hid my addiction from someone close to me. I feel an immense amount of guilt for hiding it for so long.

My last vape was 2 weeks ago, and while I have constant cravings I've resisted so far. I'm doing NRT right now and it's helping.

It feels weird to say, but I miss standing out in the rain having a lonely smoke. I hope that feeling goes away eventually.

For the past almost 2 years I’ve had monthly anxiety attacks that are crippling and just downright horrible. The process: I’d have a moment where I’d get this weird nervous aura followed by anxiety, a hot flash, shaking, sweats, and general confusion about my current situation. Everything would stop in under a minute, except the shaking and anxiety. The shaking would slow itself down after a while, but the crippling anxiety would last 3-4 days.

For a year and a half I thought I was having issues with depression and the fear of having another attack was almost just as bad. It happened every month almost to the day with a few times it skipping a month or being slightly later in the month but it was still consistent.

After multiple changes of diet and other daily routines and having no luck it finally hit me. I was mixing in way too much tobacco and having it way too often, and when I was having my attacks it was when I wasn’t having any tobacco at all. Basically withdrawal effects from not using.

1934,"I've been smoking for about 20 years (averaging between 8-12 sticks a day) and this is my fifth attempt at quitting.

Attempt 1 lasted 13 months, attempt 2 around 9 months. Attempts 3 and 4 weren't very impressive. in all those attempts, I began my first smoke-free day after chucking out all my cigarettes and lighters. and I ultimately relapsed.

what struck me now is that while I had successfully removed enablers in my previous attempts, i had never really worked on my own will power to deny the nicotine urge.

so, this time, I quit but with my ciggies all as it were on Sep 13th (when I smoked my last cigarette in this quit attempt). I still have an open pack of 8 cigarettes 3 meters away on the table - and, if I wanted to, I could light up within 3 seconds.

Longtime lurker, but finally found the courage to post here. 

Guys, I need advice. I'm trying to quit smoking for around a year now, after I reduced it to ""only weekends"". Smoked around half a pack a day for \~10 years. 

I'm always doing fine for a few weeks until social gatherings happen. A lot of my friends are heavy smokers and I get jealous all the time just looking at them smoking. Usually there is also quite a lot alcohol involved but even if I don't drink, I can't do it. Most of the times I can fight the urge to smoke for around an hour or so, but then I give in. How do you deal with such situations? How can I break up this cigarette-alcohol-link in my brain?! 

Thanks in advance.",stopsmoking,hi everyone longtime lurker finally found courage post guy need advice im trying quit smoking around year reduced weekend smoked around half pack day 10 year im always fine week social gathering happen lot friend heavy smoker get jealous time looking smoking usually also quite lot alcohol involved even dont drink cant time fight urge smoke around hour give deal situation break cigarettealcohollink brain thanks advance
1943,"Been on the fence about quitting for a while. All the mental, physical and economical benefits of not smoking aside, there's something soothing about smoking that really calms me and I guess I'm a little afraid of letting that go. 

Been smoking for about 25 years and I really don't want to quit, but I decided that with the way the world is going, there's less and less space for smokers in it. Imagine being on holiday somewhere nice. You find a great looking cozy bar and they serve you a delicious cold beer, the sun is out and everything is perfect. You ask for an ashtray and are told that it's a non-smoking facility and you need to go behind that building on the other side of the street (without your drink) to have a cigarette. 

One of my reasons for wanting to quit this habit is to avoid the imagined scenario above. I remember when they banned indoor smoking in clubs/restaurants many years ago. I was furious at the time, but it only took a little while until it became the accepted norm. And now, even as a smoker, I would not like to see indoor smoking making a return. 

I decided to seek medical help to make the process easier on me. My doctor prescribed Champix, which is a 4-week treatment. I'm now on day 6, and much to my big surprise, it took over two hours this morning (even after a couple of cups of coffee) before I realized that I'd ""forgotten"" to smoke. The cravings simply weren't there as they use to be. It is advised to continue to smoke while taking the pills for the first half, as eventually smoking will induce nausea which will hopefully help with the psychological addiction. 

Why am I writing all of this? No idea. Guess I'm just trying to put some thoughts down somewhere and this felt like an appropriate place to do so.",stopsmoking,fence quitting mental physical economical benefit smoking aside there something soothing smoking really calm guess im little afraid letting go smoking 25 year really dont want quit decided way world going there le le space smoker imagine holiday somewhere nice find great looking cozy bar serve delicious cold beer sun everything perfect ask ashtray told nonsmoking facility need go behind building side street without drink cigarette one reason wanting quit habit avoid imagined scenario remember banned indoor smoking clubsrestaurants many year ago furious time took little became accepted norm even smoker would like see indoor smoking making return decided seek medical help make process easier doctor prescribed champix 4week treatment im day 6 much big surprise took two hour morning even couple cup coffee realized id forgotten smoke craving simply werent use advised continue smoke taking pill first half eventually smoking induce nausea hopefully help psychological addiction writing idea guess im trying put thought somewhere felt like appropriate place

I read Alan Carr's How to Stop Smoking the Easy Way and haven't looked back. There are SO many benefits to being nicotine free that I've been learning about every since I quit. This one really takes the cake though.

I used to have really bad insomnia. Like, some nights I just wouldn't be able to fall asleep for hours. There were times I actually had to call out of work because it wasn't safe for me to drive on 2-3 hours of sleep. I experienced insomnia at least once a week, sometimes more. The doctor wouldn't prescribe sleeping medication and recommended I take melatonin or benadryl before bed; both of which did next to nothing for me. So I was just kind of SOL for a long time.

Two weeks after quitting nicotine, I stopped having trouble falling asleep every night. It's MAGICAL getting in the bed and just...falling asleep. I rarely have any issues falling asleep now. If I've had a stressful day, maybe it takes me 20 minutes to fall asleep instead of 10.

Cravings stayed at 7-8 out of 10 for 6 months. Straight up. It finally got a little easier this summer. COVID helped since I’ve basically stopped going to bars which is where I did a lot of smoking, but don’t get me wrong, I had plenty of cravings at home alone too. 

I was heavily dependent on throat lozenges for the first six months also.  (menthol — the stronger the better. I needed something that burned). I was going through the 200ct family pack of Halls Sugar Free menthol a week. I still like one every now and then. But it’s more like one a day max, and usually just before bed. 

My grandma died last month. We were very closed….she practically raised me. The temptation to light up was there. It was hard not to relapse. But even still, that craving was at about a 5-6 compared to what it was like during early 2021. So it does get better. But, I wouldn’t say ids “easy” yet. Because I still have to be vigilant.

Well, last weekend, my neighbor was randomly talking to me and invited me over for a couple beers. 3 in, he lights up a cig.. I was a piece of crap and asked for one and smoked it, bit drunk but no excuse.

Basically, I'm not completely powerless when I'm around an opportunity (definitely had like 5 + times where people were smoking and I did not try to ask for a cig.) But these fleeting moments where my mind says fuck it let's have half a cig or whatever on the weekend are definitely my biggest struggle rn.

She is gone right now. ....as im putting my things away ...corner of my eye catches SOME MARLBORO LIGHTS. WHAT!? SNUGGLED IN A TIN ON THE BOOKSHELF. WHAT IS HAPPENING MY SISTER DOESNT EVEN SMOKE!? MY HEAD BEGINS TO REEL. I THINK IM DIZZY IM SO EXCITED AND SHOOK. SHES NOT HERE I COULD SMOKE ONE AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW. WHERE IS THE LIGHTER!??? You guys i BARELY was able to get off that craving-go-round. I thought i was a goner...this was a close one. Addiction doesn't play y'all. Stay vigilant. Come here and read a little BEFORE YOU SMOKE. Remember why you quit. It will all come rushing back. Remember the misery. Quit for those who were never able to. Quit because fuck big tobacco. Fucking parasite/murderers.

I am 40 days in! not gunna lie i HAVE had a hard time with this and continue to. But im still glad Im doing it..I'm realizing cigarettes were a hugely toxic thing covering up issues i SERIOUSLY need to face in my life. Unaddressed depression/adhd. Holy freakin smokes. My mental health has gone buckwild since quitting. But i know i have to press on. I'm currently working on seeing if im deficient vitamine/mineral-wisw in anything...messing around with diet to see if theres any foods that might be contributing to the depression and acne breakouts. Started praying to check and see if God exists and if i could rely on such a one instead of earthly dopamine sources. Idk. I'm just shaking things up. Quitting smoking. When the fog cleared i could better see what needs work in my life. And the worry and guilt about smoking so much, about spending so much; feels really good to have that be gone. To be doing something i actually am proud of, flipping a bird to big tobacco. Finally. I remember all my tears in the beginning of this quit. Wanting so badly to be free while i sucked down cigarette after cigarette and could not stop. Fight me on this if you want but I do believe it is much harder to quit if you are depressed or adhd.

1995,"I quit nicotine fully on 1 August 2020. I don't regret it for a moment, and have no plans to ever smoke again. 

But i STILL have dreams about cigarettes. I smoke a full pack and love it, and want more, and am so happy to be smoking. When i wake up, for a few moments i think it's all true and I'm a smoker again. It's crazy. 

This happened to others?",stopsmoking,quit nicotine fully 1 august 2020 dont regret moment plan ever smoke still dream cigarette smoke full pack love want happy smoking wake moment think true im smoker crazy happened others

1998,"I have smoked for nineteen years and never stopped. I knew I was never ready. I am now. I don’t even like it anymore and I don’t want to be a smoker. It’s just becoming more of a burden than a relief. For background I smoke up to a pack a day depending on how busy I am. I really don’t want to try vaping, gum, or patches. Cold turkey or gradually decreasing nicotine intake? Any advice or words of wisdom are very much appreciated.",stopsmoking,smoked nineteen year never stopped knew never ready even like anymore want smoker becoming burden relief background smoke pack day depending busy really want try vaping gum patch cold turkey gradually decreasing nicotine intake advice word wisdom much appreciated
